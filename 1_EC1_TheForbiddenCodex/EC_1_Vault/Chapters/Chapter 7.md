[[Eddie]] hunched over his desk, his headset snug over his ears, listening intently to the static crackling through the earpieces. His [[self-made radio]]—a tangle of gears, rune-etched components, and salvaged circuitry—sat before him, flickering weakly as he prodded at its inner workings with a screwdriver.

The device had been in perfect condition until a few days ago, when he’d lost his balance and sent both himself and the radio crashing to the floor. Now, after hours of painstaking adjustments, he was determined to get it working again.

He turned the dial with precise, deliberate movements, the static shifting in pitch, but still nothing recognizable came through. With a grunt, he adjusted a rune-etched copper coil, pressing it into place with the tip of his screwdriver. The blue light on the radio wavered, then stabilized.
Then—

Bzzt—crackle—shhhh—

Something different. Not just static. A faint distortion, something buried deep within the noise. Eddie’s fingers tightened around the radio’s frame as he slowly tuned the frequency. The sound wavered in and out, shifting between static and—

A voice.

It was distant, barely above a whisper, but unmistakably human. Eddie’s pulse quickened. He had tapped into a frequency! He leaned in closer, carefully adjusting the rune alignment, his breath held—

BAM!

The door swung open, slamming against the wall.

“Eddie!”

Eddie flinched, the screwdriver slipping from his grasp. The radio let out a sharp whine before the voice disintegrated into a wall of static. Gone.

“…Damn it.”

Torrie peeked inside, clutching a thick, leather-bound book to her chest. Her twin tails bounced slightly as she hurried up to his desk, her huge round glasses reflecting the morning light. “Can you teach me [[Alchemy]]?”

Eddie sighed, barely looked up, too focused on his broken radio. “Why not ask Catherine, Torrie?” He waved a hand vaguely. “She’s a Master Alchemist. And an elf. She’s a million times better at this stuff than I am.”

“She’s out with Mom and Dad,” Torrie said, stepping closer. “They went into town, and I’ve still got a few minutes before school.”

Eddie muttered something unintelligible as he prodded a rune-etched component with his screwdriver. Torrie, undeterred, plopped herself onto his bed.

“Come on, Eddie! I just got my textbooks and wand! And I wanna learn something cool before class!” She swung her legs impatiently, staring at him expectantly. “Just the basics! Please?”
Eddie sighed, rubbing his face with his free hand. “Torrie—”

“Pleeease?” She leaned forward, her big eyes practically doubling in size behind her glasses.
Eddie groaned, finally setting down his tools. “Fine. But just the basics.”

Torrie let out a triumphant cheer as Eddie shook his head, already regretting his decision.

-o-

The curtains diffused the morning light, creating a warm ambiance in the cosy living room of the Welton household. The house was quieter than usual—no bustling activity from the apothecary or the usual scent of herbal potions drifting from the brewing room. The usual hum of the apothecary was absent, leaving only the two of the siblings in the house for the moment.

The living room was quiet, save for the soft clink of a small vial being set onto the wooden table. Inside, a globule of shimmering Quicksilver shifted lazily, reflecting the morning light in liquid ripples. Torrie sat on the edge of her seat, her new Alchemy textbook spread open beside her, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

“So,” she said, tapping the assignment page. “On the first Chapter the task is to Change the Quicksilver from liquid to solid. How do I do that?”

Eddie leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. “Well, before you even think about manipulating it, you need to understand how it changes.”

Torrie frowned. “What do you mean how?”

Eddie picked up the vial, tilting it so the Quicksilver pooled to one side. “Alchemy works because we understand how materials are structured. Every substance exists in one of four fundamental states that an Alchemist can manipulate. Think of them like different forms of the same thing.”
He held up a finger. “First, Solid. It’s stable, structured, and holds its shape.”

A second finger. “Then, Liquid. Like this Quicksilver, it flows and adapts, but still has mass.”
A third finger. “Gas. Unstable, hard to control, spreads quickly.”

And finally, his pinky. “And lightning, or Plasma. The most chaotic, the hardest to transmute, but the most powerful in raw energy.”

Torrie’s eyes widened at that last one. “Wait—lightning counts as a state of matter?”

Eddie smirked. “Yeah, where else can you lump lightnings to?.”

Torrie huffed. “Okay, okay. So how do I actually change Quicksilver’s state?”

Eddie grabbed a piece of chalk and started sketching on the wooden surface. A circular pattern took shape—rings of symbols and interwoven lines forming a precise geometric array. 

“This is a Transmutation Circle,” Eddie explained. “An Alchemist doesn’t just will something to change like a Wizard. We are physically telling it how it should change. A properly drawn Transmutation Circle acts like a bridge between the material world and the Arcane Realm.”

Torrie nodded, watching intently. Then, after a moment of thought, she asked, “What is the [[arcane]] Realm, exactly?”

Eddie exhaled, tapping the chalk against the floor. “That’s... complicated. Someone in Conjuration or Illusion would probably be able to explain it better. They deal with it more directly.” 

“From what I’ve heard,” Eddie frowned slightly, trying to recall what little he knew.  “It’s a place where time is a place. Like, you couldn’t just walk through it. That’s where all sorts of spectral creatures live, and where magic is drawn from.”

Torrie’s brows furrowed. “So it’s like another dimension?”

“Sort of. It’s said to overlap with our world—the Material Realm—but no one really knows how. Some people think you could step into it if you found the right place, but I wouldn’t try.” He shrugged. “Not my area of expertise. I just know that Alchemy communicates with it. The Arcane Realm makes the transmutation happen.”

Torrie nodded, watching intently as he added markings within the rings.

“For this exercise, you’d need to break the Quicksilver down at a fundamental level—understand its structure, its bonds, its potential for shifting states.” He tapped the chalk against the center of the circle. “Then, by channeling magic through the circle, you command the Arcane to rearrange those bonds—turning liquid to solid, or back again.”

Torrie stared at the glowing lines of the circle, excitement bubbling up. “So… can I try?”

Eddie gave a half-smile and slid the chalk toward her. “Go for it.”

Torrie straightened her back, reaching into her satchel with an eager glint in her eyes. She pulled out a small wooden box, its surface embossed with the Aella Academy crest. She lifted the lid, revealing a pristine wand nestled in velvet lining. It was brand new—smooth, polished, and untouched by use.

She picked it up, running her fingers along the lacquered wood. It was a standard-issue wand from Aella Academy—nothing special, mass-produced for students. The polished surface gleamed faintly in the morning light, reflecting her excitement.

But to Eddie, it was just reminder of the past. He had once owned the same kind of wand, back when things were simpler. 

Pushing aside the memory, Eddie watched as Torrie tapped the wand against the transmutation circle.

Nothing.

She frowned, furrowing her brows in concentration. With a sharp breath, she tried again.
This time, a faint white glow pulsed from the circle… but then it fizzled out like a dying ember.
Eddie barely contained his chuckle, but the slight shake of his shoulders gave him away.

Torrie turned to him, eyes narrowing. “What?”

“No, Nothing,” he said, biting back his grin. “You’re doing great.”

She pouted. “You’re lying.”

Eddie leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “Alright, alright. Tell me—do you still have that ring I gave you a few years ago?”

Torrie blinked. “You mean your [[Jade ring]]?”

Eddie nodded, “Yeah, that one.”

With a curious look, Torrie reached under her sweater, pulling out a thin silver chain. Dangling at the end was the ring—a simple band of dark metal, faintly etched with intricate alchemical symbols.

Eddie let out a small breath of relief. “You kept it well.”

“Of course, I did,” Torrie said, holding it up. “But… why?”

Eddie took the ring gently from her grasp, turning it between his fingers. “Your wand’s fine for spellcasting, but it’ll be different for Alchemy. The ring will help focus your magic—make channeling the Arcane much easier.”

Torrie hesitated, then nodded. She slipped the ring onto her index finger. It was far too big for her—heavy, oversized—but she clenched her fist, determined.

Then, something changed.

The transmutation circle pulsed with a deep green light, arcs of energy crackling through the etched symbols.

The Quicksilver in the vial trembled. Then, as if responding to an invisible force, it rose—slowly at first, then faster—solidifying into jagged crystalline peaks.

Torrie gasped. “I—I did it!”

She turned to Eddie, beaming.

Eddie smirked. “Told you so.”

Torrie let out an excited laugh, fists clenched in triumph. She had just performed her first transmutation.

Eddie laughed under his breath. The silence between them lingered for a moment, broken only by the soft hum of the fan and the rustling of Torrie’s broom.

Then Torrie spoke, her tone more curious than teasing. “Hey, Eddie…”

“Hmm?”

“Why’d you give me the ring?”

Eddie froze in his seat. The question hung in the air like a weight, heavier than the smell of burnt copper. He set the cloth down, avoiding Torrie’s gaze.

“You never told me,” she continued, her voice quieter now. “I mean, it’s your family’s heirloom, right? From your real family.”

Eddie exhaled, his hand tightening around the edge of the table. “Yeah, it is.”

Torrie stopped sweeping, leaning on the broom as she watched him. “So why me?”

Torrie was perched on the armrest of the couch, still fiddling with the jade-silver ring. She twirled it around her finger, her gaze thoughtful.

Eddie glanced at the silver-jade ring on Torrie’s finger as she turned it, the green stone catching the light.

“You’ll use them more than I will,” Eddie said, his tone casual, though there was an edge of finality to it. “You’re just starting in Aella Academy. You’ll need all the help you can get.”

Torrie tilted her head, her eyes narrowing. “But why don’t you need it?”

The question was so simple, so direct, that it caught Eddie off guard. Momentarily, he just stared at the textbook on the table, as though it held the answer.

Torrie leaned forward, her tone still curious but now laced with something deeper. “What do you mean, Eddie? Why don’t you use it anymore?”

He opened his mouth, then closed it again, the words sticking in his throat.

“I just… don’t, alright?” he finally said, his voice quieter than usual.

Torrie frowned, unsatisfied. “That’s not an answer.”

Eddie ran a hand through his silver hair, the gesture betraying his frustration. “It’s complicated, Torrie.”

“Then uncomplicate it,” she shot back, her tone sharper now. “Catherine said you were amazing at Alchemy. The teachers at Aella Academy said so too. So why—” She stopped herself, hesitating. 

The room felt smaller, the air heavier, even with the window open and the fan whirring. Eddie leaned back against the table, crossing his arms over his chest.

After a moment, he managed a half-hearted smile. “It’s because I’m focusing on potion-making now. You know, that doesn’t really use magic much.”

Torrie crossed her arms, her expression skeptical. “Eddie, you’re terrible at lying. You know that, right?”

Before she could press further, the front door creaked open.

“Eddie?” Markus called from the doorway.

He stepped inside, holding the edge of the doorframe with one hand and looking flustered. “Do you have the key to the shop? It’s opening time, and I can’t find it anywhere.”

Relieved, Eddie slumped his shoulders, then straightened, taking the opportunity. “Oh, uh, yeah, I think I’ve got it.” He patted his pockets with exaggerated enthusiasm, already making his way toward the door. “Let me check.”

Torrie watched him go, her eyes narrowing. 

“I’ll be right back!” he said over his shoulder, his tone too bright, too eager. “Markus and I need to get the storefront sorted.”

Eddie was just about to step out the door, a mix of relief and escape flooding through him, when Torrie’s voice cut through the air.

“Eddie?”

He froze, his hand on the doorframe, the cool wood under his fingertips feeling heavier than before. He turned back to see her standing in the doorway, holding something in her hand.
Torrie’s fingers were wrapped around the chains, and Eddie’s heirloom ring—engraved with symbols of his family—rested on top. She was offering it back to him, the delicate metal glinting in the light.

“Here,” Torrie said, her voice small but firm. “Take it back. It’s yours. They are meant to be yours.”

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. Torrie’s eyes were steady, piercing his green eyes, as though trying to read something he wasn’t saying. Eddie felt a strange knot tighten in his chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words stuck in his throat.

Then, with a deep breath, he smiled—a soft, forced thing that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“No,” Eddie said quietly, his voice almost lost in the air between them. 

“Keep it. It’s better suited for you than me.”

Torrie’s brows furrowed, a flash of confusion in her expression. She didn’t argue, as if accepting the weight of his decision. Slowly, she closed her fingers around the ring once more, her grip firm and determined.

Eddie gave her one last glance, a final, fleeting look that held everything they both left unsaid, then turned away, slipping out the door and into the early morning light.

He walked, his steps quick and purposeful, as if the moment with Torrie had never happened. As he passed the familiar sights of Weshaven, his thoughts shifted back to his routine—The Apothecary, his work, the things that didn’t ask him to explain anything.

The weight of the ring was no longer in his pocket, but he could still feel it, a reminder he had left behind.

And just like that, he lost himself in the rhythm of his day.
