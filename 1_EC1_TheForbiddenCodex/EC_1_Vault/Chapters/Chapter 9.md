His breath is still rugged as he panted, he took a long deep breath.

The gas lamps above flickered, their dim glow casting long shadows across the empty street. His fingers tightened around the wand in his hand. He looked down at it—Torrie’s wand—feeling the weight of what he’d just done.

He looked down at the wand in his hand, a mixture of disbelief and relief flooding through him. The smooth, slender stick of wood had pulled him out of yet another mess—a mess that could’ve ended with him face down in the wooden floorboards.

A slow chuckle escaped him, half disbelieving, half resigned.
Alchemy. Again.

“God damn it,” he muttered under his breath, “I could never escape using you, huh.” grinning to himself.

But before he could enjoy a moment of quiet and stillness, a voice broke through.

“Nice feeling, isn’t it?”

[[Eddie]]’s head snapped up. His pulse spiked, but he forced himself to stay still.
A figure stepped out from the alleyway, framed by the golden lamplight. 

[[Catherine]].

She sauntered closer, her lips curled in amusement, her emerald eyes gleaming like a cat who had just found its next game. “You know,” she mused, tilting her head, “the Alamirian Scholars were right about one thing, Edward. Eavesdropping isn’t the most polite thing to do.”

Eddie exhaled through his nose. Of course. She was always a step ahead.

Behind them, the pub door burst open, spilling light, shouting, and a few flailing bodies onto the street. The brawl was in full swing now.

Catherine glanced over at the chaos, then back at Eddie. “Come,” she said, stepping closer, voice smooth and coaxing. “Let’s get away from this mess.”

Eddie cast one last glance at the ruckus before letting out a slow breath. He shoved Torrie’s school-issued wand into his pocket.

“Yeah,” he muttered. “I could use a walk.”

With an effortless turn, Catherine strolled down the street, her red coat swaying behind her.

Eddie followed.
 
-o-
 
As they walked, the streets seemed quieter now. Save for the distant clink of metal and breaking wood from the pub’s brawl muffled behind them.

Catherine, however, seemed to be deep in thought. After a while, she broke the quiet.

“Do you remember that day at the dining table when I first arrived?”

“Vaguely,” he replied.

“You said you were working on something."

"Yeah."

"You are working for your advanced magical education in the Universities,” she continued.

"Yeah, I am," Eddie lied.

“And when I asked if you were considering applying for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship, you said yes.”

"Yeah, I am." Eddie continued his lie.

“But you’re not, are you, Edward?” She continued, 

Eddie stopped his track, the wind continues to howl, there is no point in hiding it anymore

"Yeah," Eddie said, admitting the truth

“Why lie?" Catherine stopped, looked back towards Eddie, her voice soft, "I know you have so much ambition for Alchemy, but now you act like it’s something to run from.”

Eddie froze, his jaw tightened. He couldn’t do this—not with Catherine, not now. She was pressing on a wound he wasn’t ready to open.

But Catherine wasn’t about to let it go. She had always been the type to ask the hard questions, to dig until she found the truth, unlike him, she is an Alchemist, a real Alchemist, and like an Alchemist she will dig the truth. 

“I might not be around by the time you enrolled in Aella Academy,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but insistent. “But I was around when you’re so passionate about your first transmutation, when you’re going to ruins and dungeons retracing the steps of famous Alchemists, when you said you wanted to go to Edenfield University to become an Alchemist.”

“You used to be so passionate about Alchemy.  What happened?” Her eyes searched his face, hoping to understand the change she couldn’t quite place. 

He couldn’t tell her. He couldn’t tell anyone.

“Fifteen years, Eddie.” Catherine’s voice broke through his spiralling thoughts, “Fifteen years is nothing for someone like me. But for you... for you, I know it must have felt like a lifetime. Something happened to you during those years I was gone, something that changes you.”
He kept his gaze forward, avoiding Catherine's eyes; the words swirling in his mind but not forming on his tongue. How could he explain the loss, the guilt, the fear? How could he explain the day he had ruined his life—and someone else’s—forever?

He still couldn’t tell her. He still couldn’t tell anyone.

Finally, she sighed. “Look, I’m not going to pretend I understand what happened to you, because I certainly don’t. But I do know that you’ve changed.”

“And not in a good way.” Catherine continued, “You’re not the person I knew, you’re not the person Torrie knew. You’ve built up walls around yourself, and from what I’ve seen, it’s tearing you apart-”

“Just drop it.” Eddie interrupted, still trying to keep a polite smile.

“I beg your pardon?” Catherine responded

“Just drop it.” Eddie said with more resolution, his voice now laden with more frustation, “People has been prying on that fact, Eddie why are you not doing alchemy anymore? Eddie why aren’t you doing your transmutation anymore? Eddie where is your passion in Alchemy?”

Eddie stood there, his smile fading, he is not trying to be polite anymore, he is not lying anymore, “I’m sick of it. I’m not interested in Alchemy anymore, okay? I’m sick of people bringing it up, I’m sick of Alchemy. So please, Catherine…”

“Just fucking drop it.”

Catherine stood there clearly taken aback, Eddie expected for her to get offended, then throwing him a three hour lecture about the importance of Alchemy, but then, she just smiled, a teasing smile as if she just found something amusing.

“I see,” Catherine finally said, sighing, crossing her arms, “Fine by me, then. I’ll drop the topic.”
A sense of ease fills Eddie, finally, some peace and quiet, no more prying, no more question-
“But I will only drop the topic only if you can drop your act.”

Eddie stood there, his heart lurching.

“What?” Eddie said, not quite sure what he was hearing, “What do you mean?”

“Don’t you see yourself, Edward?” Catherine said, now turning towards the pier, her arms resting on its wooden railing, “If you’re truly disinterested in Alchemy… sick of it, even.”

She then turned her head, facing Eddie, her short hair blown by the cold, sea breeze, “Then why keep working on it?”

“I see the formula you perfected up in Robert’s tower, Edward.” Catherine continued, “The assignments you’ve helped Torrie with.”

“And don’t even get me started with your room.” Catherine continued, now turning her body, still leaning to the wooden railing, “The transmutation circles you’ve designed in your spare time, the copies of Alchemical tomes scattered on your desk, how you tried to continue your research from Aella Academy, and don't say that you did all of that hard work just for 'fun'.”

Catherine opened her arms, “Why do all of that, if you’re sick of it?”

She now puts her hands back on her coat’s pocket, “I would’ve let you slide if you truly, truly hate it, Edward, sure. But the fact is that you don’t. You still have that passion roaring deep within you that you tried to suppress, you’re playing an act of hating Alchemy whilst the fact that you still passionate about it. That, I can’t stand.”

“Then what do you want me to do?” Eddie asked, chuckling sarcastically, his voice low, his eyes finally meeting hers. “Do you want me just to get back to it? Pick it up again like nothing happened?”

Catherine stood there for a moment, leaning against the pier.

“I wished you were, but i know it’s not that simple, is it? I don't know what happened to you during the years i was gone, and surely Torrie and your parents didn't know too because you didn't tell them.” Her gaze steady, and then she gave him a small, determined smile. “So, despite all of that. I’m going to offer you something different.”

Catherine stood there, the wind blows her short apple-red hair, her red coat flutters in the cold evening breeze like a flag of declaration, the silhouette of her sharp elven ear made the whole scene felt like a fairy tale. She then looked at Eddie's eyes, taking her hand out of her pocket, and raising it, and points it straight at his face.

“I’m offering you an adventure.”

For a moment, Eddie could only stare. The scene before him felt unreal—like something out of a storybook, a fleeting moment of magic woven into the fabric of his mundane, daily life.
The streets were hushed, distant from the uproar of the tavern. The world around them had shrunk to just this. 

Flickering lamplight, whispers of the wind, the gentle sound of the ocean waves hitting the pier. And the unwavering intensity of Catherine’s gaze.

 “What?” He laughed softly, as if snapping back to reality, still trying to process it. “What are you even talking about?”
 
"I'm offering you an Adventure for you to be a part of." Catherine repeated, her voice steady and firm. “There’s a Codex hidden deep within the illusory forest of The Deep Glaive, that was what i was discussing with the Alamirian Scholars back there, it will be a journey into the unknown part of Weshaven. I could use a fellow Alchemist like you." She smiled, "It'll be like the old days, isn't it?”
“A fellow, is a hard stretch don’t you think, Catherine?” Eddie chuckled, his face sombre, “It can't be like the old days, you know? I’m not that kid anymore, Catherine,” he said quietly. “I can’t be that kid. That kid is no more.”

“Of course you're not, you'll never be as idiotic and reckless as your younger days...” Catherine laughed,  “You don’t have to be that kid, Eddie. You just need to be you.”

Eddie looked into her eyes, seeing the earnestness in her gaze. An invitation, a chance to leave behind his regrets and step back into something larger than himself.

He didn’t have an answer right away. But in the silence that followed, he knew that Catherine wasn’t going to let him walk away from this, not that easily. Not when she knew something about him.

“I don’t know,” Eddie said.

“It’s okay,” Catherine said, now continuing her pace, Eddie followed, the cadence of their footsteps echoes through the hard cobblestone road, “But you don’t have to lie anymore, it’s futile. You can lie all you want to Torrie, to Markus, Alyssa, Robert. But one thing for certain.”

“You can’t lie to a fellow Alchemist.”
