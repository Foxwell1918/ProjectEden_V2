\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {From Catherine or an Elf}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are no different than me. There are no difference between an Elf, a Mortal and a Dwarf.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93People thought that Elves are the sons and daughters of the gods. Sent to these lands as an exemplary, as a guides to the Mortals of this world. They thought they were so high up, a diety, some societies even godifies us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are no different than Mortals. We came from the same ancestors. We grew longer and sharper ears because we dwell in the deep roofed forest of Lunaria, we have sharper visions because we have to navigate through the darkness, we are natural at magic because that was what abundant in Lunaria. We are immortal because our ancestors diet consisted of an extinct fruit that have regenerative properties.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s funny, really. We are immortals, but we cease to become so when we procreate, our evolution works against us.\u8221\'94 }}
