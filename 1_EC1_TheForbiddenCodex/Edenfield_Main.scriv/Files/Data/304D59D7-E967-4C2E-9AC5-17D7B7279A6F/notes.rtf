Torrie came in barging, she wants Eddie to teach her the basic of Alchemy, since she just got her textbooks\line \line At first Eddie brushed her off, not paying attention, saying that why not ask Aunt Catherine? She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s better at Alchemy.\line \line She said Catherine and their parents is away at the town, and she still got a few minutes before school\line \line She kept bugging him, and eventually Eddie relented, agreeing to teach her the basics of Alchemy}

\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 1. Eddie and Torrie is at the living room}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 2. Torrie wants to do the first Assignment, that is Manipulating a Quicksilver, which is a Metal usually used for students practicing Alchemy}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 The assignment is saying that the student must be able to manipulate the State of Matter of the Quicksilver from Liquid into Solid, and back again into Liquid}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 Torrie then asked Eddie how can she do that,}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 Eddie then explained in Alchemy, an object is devided into 4 different states of matter an Alchemist can manipulate:\line 1. Solid (Firmus)}
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 2. Liquid (Fluensus)}
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 3. Gas (Caligo)}
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 4. And Lightning (Flumens)\line \line And an Alchemist can command the Arcane (which where magic came from in this series) through a Transmutation Circle}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 If an Alchemist can detail the material\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s components and how it can be broken down, the transmutation circle will communicate it to the arcane realm and make it happen, hence, the Magic of Alchemy}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 Eddie just so happen to have his old practicing tool, that is a Quicksilver that is encased in glass, since Quicksilver Metal is highly toxic, it is safer to be put in the glass\line \line }
