\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {The old wooden steps of the lighthouse creaked under Eddie\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s weight as he made his way downstairs. His mother\u8217\'92s words still echoed in his head, circling the question she had really been asking him, the hope she refused to let go of. }{\f0\fs24\i1 Return. Take up Alchemy again.}
\par\plain {He knew what she meant. She wanted him to go back to the one field, the }{\f0\fs24\i1 only}{ field, where he had ever felt truly alive, where he had been the best. For a fleeting, dangerous moment, he allowed himself to remember the feeling\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the effortless flow of aether through his hands, the perfect, intuitive snap of a transmutation circle locking into place. He remembered the praise, the confidence, the power.}
\par\plain {And then, as it always did, the other memory followed, unbidden and sharp as glass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\i1 The scent of ozone and burnt herbs. The high-pitched, desperate screaming, a sound that dissolved into a choked, pathetic whimper. The sight of the boy lying motionless on the stone floor of the dueling chamber, a failed circle glowing faintly around him\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\i1 Thwack.}
\par\plain {A crumpled ball of paper bounced squarely off the side of his head, shattering the memory into a thousand pieces. Eddie flinched, shaking his head as if to dislodge the last vestiges of the phantom scream. He looked down to the bottom of the stairs. Torrie stood there, arms crossed over her new robes, a furious expression on her face. Her breakfast sat half-eaten on the table beside her.}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ow,\u8221\'94 Eddie grumbled, rubbing the spot where the makeshift projectile had hit. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s uncalled for.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You lied to me!\u8221\'94 Torrie groaned, her voice a sharp accusation that cut through his lingering daze. \u8220\'93You promised me! You said I\u8217\'92d get a staff if I got into Aella Academy!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {Eddie sighed, sliding into the chair opposite her and finally starting on his own now-lukewarm breakfast. He quickly grabbed a sausage and pointed it at her. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey, I did that to motivate you on your entrance exam, okay?\u8221\'94 he said around a mouthful. He took a quick swallow and mumbled under his breath, \u8220\'93Never would\u8217\'92ve thought you\u8217\'92d actually get in\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ow!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {His leg jerked from a swift, well-aimed kick under the table.}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was that?!\u8221\'94 Torrie demanded, her eyes narrowed.}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing! Look,\u8221\'94 Eddie said, deciding a change of tactic was desperately needed. \u8220\'93The Twig will be the best wand that you\u8217\'92ll ever use in Silverwood, okay? Their academy-issue wands suck, trust me. They're stiff, they have no personality. The Twig will help you in the long run.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s ugly and rough,\u8221\'94 Torrie mumbled into her robes, her anger deflating back into a stubborn sulk.}
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what did Mum say?\u8221\'94 Eddie pressed, a knowing glint in his eye.}
\par\plain {Torrie let out an immense, theatrical groan that echoed in the small kitchen. She slumped in her chair, then straightened up, puffing out her chest and adopting a surprisingly accurate, gravelly-smooth imitation of their mother\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lecturing voice. \u8220\'93\u8216\'91It is not the wand, nor the staff, that casts great magic, dear. It is the magician.\u8217\'92\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {A genuine laugh escaped Eddie\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lips, the first real one of the morning. The sound was warm, chasing away some of the attic's gloom that still clung to him. "That's the one," he said, shaking his head with a smile. "It's the exact same thing she said to me when I first started out." He took another bite of toast, a nostalgic look on his face. \u8220\'93Some things never change.\u8221\'94}}
