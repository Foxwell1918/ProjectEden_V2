\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 1. Eddie stood there}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 2. The dragon fired shot}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 3. Eddie was trapped, taking cover in a ruined courtyard, the dragon continually fired its icy breath, bringing everything into jagged ice}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 4. Eddie then remembers, the gunpowders, lead balls, ignition, metal, fire\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 Fireballs}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 He then began thinking of the Transmutation Circle, how it all came to be, who hard it will propell forward\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 He got it!\line \line He just needed an opening, he continually moving, obviously trying to make as little noise as possible, whilst avoiding the dragon\u8217\'92s gaze}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 As the dragon finishes his icy breath, it looked around, it sniffed, it seemed to try finding Eddie}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 And then, an opening, the Dragon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes met Eddie, and Eddie met its eyes, but there is something else\line \line On Eddie\u8217\'92s hand is a circular holographic transmutation circle and on top of it, a small metal ball, fire encapsulating it, the fire glows brightly}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 And then it shots}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 5. Eddie hits the dragon, the fireball hits the dragon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest where the scales were a lot more thinner, it made a little indent, but not penetrating it}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 6. The dragon retalliates, he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t escape, and was hit }
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 7. Is this how he die? Eddie thought, }
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 8. But before the dragon could unleash his cold breath, Catherine emerges from the place where she lie, she had regained her conciousness, she had mended her staff, and she is shooting fireball}
\par\plain \f0\fs20\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn fool,\u8221\'94 She spat, \u8220\'93Should\u8217\'92ve stayed with the others.\u8221\'94}
