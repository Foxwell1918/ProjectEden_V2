\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eddie met with the two scholars named Aenid and Hadir, they recognised him from Weshaven, and talked about the codex they got from Catherine. One of them argues that it might be Necromancy, but the other argues otherwise, \line \line \tab The scholars argues that no form of Magical Branch can seemingly do the technique described in the Codex, either they needed a Spellcraftsman to construct a new spell system to cast the spell described in the Codex, or else, they needed someone that can perform and understood Ancient Magic, which is debatable, since nobody would be alive today to know such a thing, not even Master Katarina}

But the magic of Animation is either taboo or forbidden, and it is said that the technique lies in the Codex Chilandar, the one codex kept secret by the Two Scholars}
