\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Magic in Edenfield comes from the Well of Illyria, that resides in the Holy Capital of Illyria}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Country of Illyria resides between the country of Solivia and Gwyndorith, a small city sized country that is ruled by the Archdeacon and its Wellkeepers}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The city is built on a crater, on the crater, there are islands of different cities built on top of it, there are bridges and elevators leading up to different floating islands in Illyria}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But on the depth of its crater, there is a holy building}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Holy Keep}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Where inside, there is a huge well, it still made of ancient stone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 Pre-historic people made the stone well back then}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 On top of the Well, there are two stone half-moon shaped seal, a kind of gate, that is slightly closing the well}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 From the Well, it emits a strong blue ish energy upwards that shot up, into the crater above, to the islands above, and into the entire continent\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 into the atmosphere of earth itself}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 is where Magic came from, beyond the Well, there might be The Arcane.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nobody knew what is beneath the Well, what history knows that if the Well is opened more, more magical energy surges, more power}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The more it closes, the less magical energy there are in the world}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For now, it is partially closed. And for ages, magic has been in balance between good and evil.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Wellkeepers are always in a council, thinking about the state of the Well, and when to open it, when to close it}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Wellkeepers are blind, only guided by the voices and commands of the Arcane and the Archdeacon.}}
