            <Text>

“Look, Torrie. It’s not that it doesn’t fascinate me,” Eddie said finally, his voice strained. “There’s just... nothing else to discuss. I don’t know what else to say about her.” 

“You used to be so eager to meet Aunt Catherine!” Her eyes narrowed. Her voice rose, “You’d spend hours talking about her, sharing everything you learned from her with me. Now, you act like she’s just another stranger. She noticed it, too. Doesn’t that bother you?” 

“Look, Torrie…” Eddie’s face flushed, his patience wearing thin. He shook his head, frustrated by her insistence. “It’s not that simple. You don’t understand—” 

“Don’t I?!” Torrie’s voice cracked as she cut him off. Her whole body trembled, but she stood her ground. “Don’t I understand what happened that day? The day Mom and Dad were called to your school out of nowhere? The day you left home grinning, rambling about alchemy like always, and then came back—” Her breath hitched. “Looking like something inside you had died!?”
Eddie flinched.
Torrie’s voice wavered, but she pressed on, desperate. “You used to be passionate about Alchemy, Eddie. You used to talk about it like it was everything. You looked up to Aunt Catherine like she was some kind of hero—even though you hadn’t seen her in years. Even though it would take decades before you got to meet her again, you still dreamed about it! You were going to share your research with her, show her everything you’d learned.”
Her hands trembled. “But now you’re just… empty.”
Silence hung between them, heavy, suffocating.
“Don’t you feel bad for her, Ed?” Her voice cracked, raw with emotion. “Alchemy used to be your life. You used to dream about it. Chase it. And now you just—” She sucked in a shuddering breath. “Now you act like it’s nothing.”
She wiped at her face with the sleeve of her coat, her shoulders rising and falling as she struggled to keep control.
“What happened to you?!”
Eddie’s jaw clenched. His fingers curled into fists. His whole body tensed like a wire stretched too tight.
Then—
“Enough!” he shouted.
Eddie stood up, looking at Torrie, “You want to know what happened? Do you?”
Torrie swallowed, her lips parting as if to speak, but no words came out.
Eddie let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “Fine. You want the truth? Here it is.”
His hands trembled at his sides, but he forced himself to keep talking. The words came spilling out, like a wound torn open.
“Back at Aella Academy… when I was still a student there…” His hands curled tighter, fingernails digging into his palms.  “I’ve got a classmate named Davies. Arrogant, cruel—he had everything handed to him, and he liked to remind people of it.”
“He especially liked tormenting Markus…. And Markus wasn’t as adept at magic as the rest of us. He was an easy target. And I was the only one who gave a damn about it.”
He took a step forward, his voice rising. “I didn’t fit in either. I didn’t try to. But Markus… He was my friend. My only real friend.”
He looked away, as if the memory was too much to face. “One day, Davies pushed too far. He cornered Markus, humiliated him—said he was leeching off me, that he had no right to even be there. He challenged Markus to a duel, knowing damn well he couldn’t win.”
Torrie’s lips parted slightly, but she said nothing. She just listened.
Eddie let out a ragged breath. “He never stood a chance. And I—I couldn’t just stand there. I was so goddamn angry, so sick of Davies, so tired of the way he tore people down just because he could.” His voice cracked, but he forced himself to go on. “So I challenged him instead.”
He turned away for a moment, as if he couldn’t bear to look at her. “Davies laughed in my face. He was a Conjuration student—everyone knew Alchemy wasn’t suited for dueling. I should’ve lost.” He let out a shaky exhale. “I should’ve lost.”
Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.
Torrie’s hands trembled at her sides. “But you didn’t.”
Eddie’s jaw tightened. His throat ached, his vision blurred. He forced himself to meet her gaze.
“No,” he said, barely above a whisper. “I didn’t.”
His breath hitched, and he turned his hands over, staring at them as if they still carried the weight of that moment. “I don’t even know how it happened. One second, I was transmuting, trying to redirect his attack, and the next—” His voice faltered. He shut his eyes, as if he could block out the memory, but it was burned into him.
“His face,” Eddie whispered, the horror creeping back into his voice. “Half of it was gone.”
Torrie’s breath caught in her throat.
“There was nothing left but burns and warped flesh. His screams—” Eddie stopped himself, his whole body shuddering. “There was no coming back from it. And after that, I was expelled.”
The word hung in the air like a sentence passed down in a courtroom.
“The Aella Council called it black magic,” he muttered, his voice hollow. “Said what I did was unnatural, dangerous. That I should’ve lost. That expelling me was easier than letting it turn into a scandal.”
Eddie let out a bitter laugh, but there was no humor in it. “And you know what the worst part is?” He looked up at Torrie, his eyes dark, haunted. “I don’t even know if they were wrong.”
Torrie’s lips trembled. “Eddie…”
He turned away sharply. “Now you know,” he said, his voice thick with exhaustion. “Now you understand.”

“But still…” Torrie, took a step back. “You’ve changed so much, Eddie. It’s like you’re not even the same person anymore.” 

“Maybe I’m not.” Panting and shaken, Eddie looked at her with regret and defiance.  “Maybe I can’t be the person I was before. You don’t know what it’s like to live with the consequences of your actions. And I hope you never.” 

For a moment, the forest seemed to close around them, the weight of their argument pressing down on both of them. The glow of the Luminas felt colder, and the distance between them seemed to widen with every harsh word. 

Torrie’s tears continued to flow, her voice a whisper of anguish. “I just... I wish you could see how much we still need that part of you, Eddie… The part you’ve killed that day… The part that believed in Alchemy and the good it could do.” 

“There is no good coming from it, Torrie.” Eddie said finally, “Nothing…”

The silence between Eddie and Torrie was thick, the weight of their argument still pressing down on them. The soft rustling of leaves, the distant hum of crickets—everything felt muted, suffocated beneath unspoken words.
Then, a sharp noise—footsteps, fast and uneven, crushing through undergrowth. A breathless, ragged gasp broke the stillness.
Markus burst through the trees, his silhouette illuminated by the golden glow of the Eden Flowers. His face was pale, streaked with sweat, his wide eyes darting wildly. He clutched his flintlock rifle with both hands, knuckles white, as if his grip was the only thing keeping him grounded.
“Eddie!” His voice cracked. His chest heaved, each breath short and desperate.
Eddie scrambled to his feet. “Markus?”
Markus staggered forward, barely able to steady himself. “Catherine—” He choked on the words, forcing them out between gulps of air. 

“She’s in trouble. There’s something in there… something huge!”

            <Title>Chapter 24 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The ruins had fallen silent.
The acrid scent of burnt stone and charred scales lingered in the cold night air. Smoke curled into the sky, blotting out the moon.
Eddie and Catherine trudged through the shattered remnants of the Traveler’s Path, the path barely recognizable beneath the rubble. The trees loomed around them, casting long, jagged shadows over the uneven ground.
Catherine walked beside him, clutching the splintered remains of her once-proud brass mahogany staff. Its delicate engravings, once gleaming with alchemical precision, were now marred by cracks and soot.
Eddie’s rifle—his father’s rifle—lay in two broken halves, its finely crafted compartments torn apart. Each step forward pressed the weight of the battle deeper into his chest.
He supported Catherine with a steady hand, his alchemy-infused salves having eased some of her pain, but unable to mend the deep bruises and the sharp, unnatural angle of her arm. She barely winced but held it close, as if acknowledging the injury would make it worse.
His own body ached—bruises, burns, exhaustion pressing in like a vice. His steps were uneven, breaths shallow, but he refused to slow down. Not yet.
The night stretched on, the forest shifting around them. Quiet. Too quiet.
Catherine finally spoke, her voice hesitant, breaking the fragile silence.
“Eddie… you’ve been so distant lately. What happened?”
Eddie’s gaze remained fixed on the ground, his expression unreadable, his thoughts a storm. He took a slow breath, the weight of something unspoken settling between them.
“It’s a long story, Catherine…”
She glanced at him, her golden eyes flickering with curiosity and something softer—concern.
“Alright,” she murmured, voice just above a whisper. “You care to tell it?”
Eddie exhaled, his breath shaky, his words bitter and heavy with regret.
“Come on,” Catherine tried making a teasing gesture, “We got all the time in the world now.”
“Fine,” Eddie chuckled, “Back at the academy… I uh.”
Eddie swallowed, “I…”
“I-I used the same kind of magic against a boy named Davies.&quot;
He hesitated. The name tasted like iron in his mouth.
“The one you used against the dragon?”
&quot;Yeah… We had a duel. And I—&quot;
His throat tightened. The memory wrapped around his chest like a vice. &quot;I scarred him, Catherine.&quot; His voice was barely above a whisper. &quot;Not just a mark. A permanent scar.&quot;
His fingers curled into a fist at his side.
&quot;I didn’t just hurt him… I ruined him.&quot;
The night pressed in around them. The cold gnawed at his skin, but it was nothing compared to the ice settling in his gut.
&quot;And all I could think was—&quot; his voice cracked, his heartbeat a thunder in his ears, &quot;I was a monster.&quot;
He could still see their faces. The stares.
&quot;That’s how they saw me. How they always was. In their eyes, I was someone to be afraid of. I was someone to be careful of.&quot;
Eddie’s breath hitched.
&quot;Alchemy… it’s not just a knowledge for me, Catherine. It changes me. It makes me into someone else… Someone dark.&quot;
He swallowed hard.
&quot;And I—I couldn’t bear it… Not anymore… I was done.&quot;
His fists clenched. The bitterness burned in his throat.
&quot;So when the academy expelled me, part of me was relieved.&quot; His laugh was hollow, bitter. &quot;It was an excuse. A reason to walk away. To leave it all behind. To finally be free of that world. That power. To stop being this... thing everyone had to fear.&quot;
His voice trembled on the last word.
The confession left him raw, exposed. He forced himself to look at Catherine, bracing for judgment.
&quot;But deep down…&quot; his voice dropped, haunted, &quot;I can’t leave it. I can’t run from it. It’s a part of me. I can’t escape what I am.&quot;
Silence.
Catherine didn’t speak right away. She didn’t rush to fill the void his words left behind. She just stood there, the weight of his guilt settling between them.
Then, finally—
Her expression softened. &quot;I see.&quot; Her voice was gentle, but there was no pity in it. Just understanding. &quot;That must have been devastating.&quot;
Eddie nodded, his voice low, tinged with regret.
&quot;I felt a guilt I’d never known before.&quot; The words came out hoarse, as if admitting it made the weight heavier. &quot;I couldn’t bear the thought of hurting someone like that again. So when I got my expulsion notice… I shut myself off from Alchemy.&quot;
He exhaled sharply. &quot;I thought if I stayed away, I could protect people. That it was the right thing to do.&quot;
His fists clenched. &quot;But it just made me numb.&quot; His gaze dropped to the ground, lost in the patterns of dirt and shadows. &quot;I lost my purpose. I lost everything that day.&quot;
Catherine suddenly stopped walking.
Her expression was serious, but not unkind. &quot;Eddie,&quot; she said, her voice calm but unwavering. &quot;Throughout history, magic has been used for both great good and terrible evil.&quot;
Her gaze held his, steady with conviction.
&quot;There have been sorcerers who toppled kingdoms, enslaved millions, and committed atrocities beyond imagination.&quot;
She let that sink in before continuing.
&quot;Like Nocturnilus the Conqueror.&quot;
The name alone felt heavy in the air.
&quot;Once, he was just a spellcraftsman—a sorcerer in service to the Northern Elven Kingdom. The elves have always lived by magic, weaving it into every part of their lives. It was a gift, a birthright, a force of creation.&quot;
Her voice darkened.
&quot;But for Nocturnilus, it was never enough.&quot;
She glanced at the treetops, as if searching for memories carved into the night sky.
&quot;Blinded by greed, by the hunger for more, he turned his power toward conquest. He was the first sorcerer to raise a city of stone with a mere gesture—and the first to reduce one to ash just as easily. He marched across the lands, toppling kings, razing kingdoms, and forging an empire from the ruins of others.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the weight of history pressing against his chest.
&quot;His armies enslaved millions, binding them with chains wrought from his own magic. He thought himself invincible.&quot;
Catherine’s voice dropped lower, almost a whisper. &quot;But the more he took, the more magic consumed him. It changed him. His flesh, his mind… his very soul. By the end, he was no longer a man. Some say he was no longer even an elf. Just a shadow, a being twisted by his own power.&quot;
&quot;And there was Aeron the Founder.&quot;
The name lingered between them like a spark in the cold night air.
&quot;He was an elf, like Nocturnilus. In fact, he once served under him—stood at his side as a fellow conjurer, weaving spells to expand Nocturnilus’s empire. For years, he followed orders, watching cities crumble, watching people enslaved by the very magic that was meant to enrich elven lives.&quot;
Catherine’s voice grew firm. &quot;But then, something changed. Aeron looked at the ruins they had left behind, at the lives shattered by conquest, and he could no longer bear it. He chose to walk away.&quot;
Eddie frowned. &quot;He just… left?&quot;
&quot;Not just left,&quot; Catherine corrected. &quot;He defied. He turned against the empire he had once helped build. He traveled to the very lands he had once helped destroy—not as a conqueror, but as a healer. As a teacher. 
“He taught magic to those who feared it, gave power to those who had none. And in the end, it was his students, his disciples, the very people Nocturnilus had enslaved, who brought the tyrant down to his knees.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the weight of her words settling in his chest.
&quot;Aeron could have followed the same path,&quot; Catherine continued, &quot;but he chose differently. He eventually founded and became one of the Nine Sages, the very founders of the magical world as we know it.”
“He and the others built cities where there was only wasteland, cured diseases that once ravaged nations, opened doors to possibilities no one had dared to dream of before.&quot;
Eddie’s fingers twitched at his sides. His thoughts churned, Catherine’s words fighting against years of self-doubt.
Catherine didn’t hesitate. She placed a hand on his shoulder, firm and reassuring.
&quot;It’s not about what magic can do,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s about what you can to do with it.&quot;
The weight of her words settled in his chest, pressing against the scars he had buried deep.
&quot;You have the power to help, Eddie. To heal. To make a difference. But you have to believe in yourself first.&quot;
For a moment, neither of them spoke. The night stretched quiet and still around them.
Eddie inhaled slowly, his gaze lifting to the darkened path ahead.
Somehow, the night didn’t feel so suffocating anymore. The weight in Eddie’s chest was still there, but it no longer crushing him—it simply lingered, like the ache of an old wound.
Then, as they emerged from the dense trees onto the open road, familiar figures came into view.
Markus stood with his arms crossed, pacing slightly, his sharp eyes scanning the darkness. Torrie, bundled in her yellow knit sweater, was bouncing on her heels, her long twin tails swaying as she peered anxiously down the path.
The moment they saw them, relief broke across their faces—but it was Catherine, not Eddie, who immediately caught their attention.
“Bloody hell,” Markus swore, rushing toward them. “What happened to her?”
Torrie gasped, her huge round glasses slipping down her nose as she ran forward. “Catherine! You’re hurt!” Her eyes darted to the awkward way Catherine held her left arm, the fabric of her sleeve torn and bloodied.
Catherine, despite the obvious pain tightening her jaw, managed a wry smile. “Elves heal fast. You should worry about Eddie—he’s the delicate one.”
Eddie shot her an exasperated look, but Torrie wasn’t buying it. 
Torrie grabbed Catherine’s good hand and inspected her arm like a stern doctor. “Fast healing or not, a broken arm isn’t something you can just ‘walk off’!”
Markus turned to Eddie, scanning him up and down. His expression was unreadable for a moment, but then he clapped a hand on Eddie’s shoulder, gripping tightly. “You alright?”
Eddie hesitated. Was he?
The old instinct was to say yes, to brush it off, to pretend everything was fine. But after tonight—after everything—he found himself answering truthfully.
“…I don’t know.”
Markus’s grip tightened for a second, then he gave a small nod. “We’ll figure it out.”
Torrie, still fussing over Catherine, threw a glare at them. “Well, don’t just stand there! We need to get her somewhere safe before she keels over from blood loss!”
Catherine sighed dramatically. “So bossy.”
Eddie let out a small, tired chuckle. And just like that, the weight of the night seemed a little easier to bear.
The tension was lifting, the road ahead no longer so dark.</Text>
            <Notes>What do they want? And why cant they have it?

Eddie wants to defeat the Nightingale Fox, an illusory Shape-shifting creature that dwells in the Illusory forest. But it keeps fading, it changes and it attacks.

Who cares? What happen if they dont get it?

What is the good news?



What is the bad news?

            <Text>Eddie stepped off the ferry first, tossing a few coins to the ferryman before helping Torrie down onto the sturdy wooden planks of Osthaven’s dock. The air here was different—crisper, drier. Less of that thick, briny scent of fish that clung to Weshaven. Instead, the harbour was filled with the rich aromas of spice crates being unloaded, the earthy scent of dried herbs, and the occasional whiff of parchment and ink from merchants tallying their stock.
Osthaven was busier in a different way. Where Weshaven had the steady rhythm of fishermen mending nets and unloading the morning’s catch, Osthaven hummed with the brisk efficiency of trade. Men and women haggled over silk and spices from distant lands, warehouse workers hauled crates marked with foreign sigils, and couriers darted between carts carrying letters sealed with wax.
Torrie took it all in, wide-eyed. “It’s… bigger than I thought.”
Eddie smirked. “Told you. Less fish guts, more commerce.”
They moved through the streets, weaving past merchants arranging their displays and scholars in robes, their arms laden with books. As they walked, Eddie found his eyes drifting, the familiar streets pulling at old memories.
As they walked through the bustling streets of Osthaven, Eddie gestured toward a small stall by the corner, where the scent of roasted chestnuts wafted through the air.
&quot;See that?&quot; Eddie said, nudging Torrie. &quot;Markus and I used to stop there after classes. We'd split a bag of chestnuts and complain about assignments the whole way home.&quot;
Torrie looked over, her nose scrunching slightly. &quot;You two really bonded over complaining, huh?&quot;
Eddie smirked. &quot;It's an art form, I tell you.&quot;
They continued down the road, past the colorful stalls of cloth merchants, until Eddie’s gaze landed on a narrow shop with a faded green awning.
&quot;And that place,&quot; he pointed, &quot;Was where I used to get supplies for my... projects.&quot;
Torrie raised an eyebrow. &quot;What kind of 'projects'?&quot;
Eddie chuckled. &quot;Alchemy, mostly. The owner—grumpiest old man you'd ever meet—used to grumble about every single request I made, but he never actually turned me away.&quot;
Torrie grinned. &quot;Sounds like he liked you.&quot;
Eddie scoffed, shaking his head. “I think he just liked my coins.”
Eddie slowed slightly, his fingers brushing against the strap of his bag. It was strange, being back. The town hadn’t changed much, but everything felt different now.
Torrie noticed his lingering gaze. “You’ve been here a lot, huh?”
Eddie gave a small nod, exhaling softly. “Yeah… long ago.”
Torrie smiled. “Well, now I’m here too.”
Eddie chuckled, shaking off the weight of nostalgia. “Yeah. Let’s get you to Aella.”

-o-

Eddie pedaled through the last stretch of road, the cobbled streets of Osthaven giving way to packed dirt as they left the bustle of town behind. Fields of golden hay swayed gently in the morning breeze, stretching far and wide, their soft rustling the only sound accompanying them now.
And then, past the gentle slope of the hill, Aella Academy came into view.
It stood just as Eddie remembered—tall, sturdy, with its weathered stone walls and a modest courtyard nestled at its center. It wasn’t the grandest school in Solivia, not the kind spoken of in hushed reverence like Edenfield, but around here, it was everything. A place of learning, discipline, and quiet ambition.
Eddie slowed the bike to a stop near the front gate. Torrie hopped off, adjusting her satchel, her eyes gleaming as she took in the sight before her.
“Well,” she said, turning to him, a wide grin breaking across her face, “I guess this is it.”
 “You’ll do fine, Torrie.” Eddie said, forcing a small smirk. “You better not cause too much trouble.”
She stuck her tongue out playfully before stepping forward, her pace quickening until she was practically skipping through the front gate.
Eddie lingered by the entrance, watching her go. 
He saw himself in her.
The same eagerness, the same restless energy that had carried him through these very gates years ago. He remembered what it was like, standing on the threshold of something new, looking ahead and seeing only possibility.
Now, he stood on the other side of it.
Eddie let out a quiet breath, gripping the handles a little tighter before shaking his head.
“Go get ‘em, Torrie.”
And with that, he turned the bike around and started pedaling back towards town.

-o-

Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the hum of the town buzzing around him. The salty breeze had thinned, replaced by the scent of fresh bread, spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach reminded him, with a low grumble, that breakfast had been hurried.
He slowed to a stop near a familiar stall, the one that sold honeyed almonds and sesame biscuits. The sight alone pulled him back to old routines—grabbing a bag for himself, an extra for Markus. It had been a while, but some habits never quite faded.
After paying the vendor, he stepped back toward his bicycle, ready to sling the bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
A building stood across the street, its architecture different from the others around it. Age clung to its stone walls, yet the towering columns bore intricate carvings, their shapes unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, but their elegance remained, a relic of a bygone era.
Above the heavy wooden doors, an emblem was set in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into the worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, something stirring in his chest. He hadn’t noticed it before—maybe he had never cared to look. But now, standing there, it felt like the building was watching him back.
Eyes tracing the contours of the emblem, Eddie lingered a moment longer, the owl’s unblinking gaze seeming almost knowing. The Sage Institute. He knew nothing about it—had never needed to—but something about it gnawed at the edges of his mind. A curiosity, fleeting yet persistent.
With a breath, he shook it off, tucking the bag of snacks securely inside his satchel before turning back to his bicycle. The world outside his thoughts rushed back in—the chatter of merchants, the rhythmic clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the occasional call of dockworkers hauling cargo.
He swung a leg over the bike and pushed off, weaving through the streets of Osthaven with practiced ease. The town passed him by in a blur of nostalgia and familiarity, but his mind remained half elsewhere, lingering on the building, on the emblem, on the feeling.
The distant chime of a bell tower reminded him of the time. He wasn’t in a hurry, but he didn’t want to miss the next ferry back to Weshaven either.
By the time he reached the harbor, the ferry was already boarding. He rolled his bicycle up the gangway, found a quiet spot near the railing, and exhaled, letting the sea breeze wash over him.
Back to Weshaven. Back to his routines.

-o-

Eddie stepped off the ferry, the lingering scent of salt and fish clinging to his coat as he pedaled back through the familiar streets of Weshaven. The town moved at its usual pace—fishermen hauling in their morning catches, merchants calling out their wares, the rhythmic hammering of shipwrights at work. It felt routine, but his thoughts still lingered on Osthaven, on Aella, on the emblem of the owl perched on a scroll.
By the time he reached the apothecary, the comforting scent of herbs and simmering potions greeted him like an old friend. He pushed open the wooden door and stepped into the brewing room, where golden light streamed through the lofty windows, casting long, shifting shadows.
A deep but gentle voice called out from the far end of the room, its warmth filling the space like the heat of a hearth.
&quot;Morning, Edward!&quot;
Markus stood hunched over his workstation, his broad frame making the desk seem almost too small for him. His wild curls peeked out from under his cap, and a faint flush colored his round cheeks—likely from standing over boiling cauldrons all morning. 
He was a large presence in every sense, but his movements were measured, careful, and full of practiced ease as he stirred a simmering mixture, his huge hands treating delicate ingredients with surprising gentleness.
Eddie smirked and reached into his satchel. &quot;Got you something.&quot;
Markus glanced up, his dark eyes curious as Eddie handed over a small paper bag. A familiar scent wafted from within.
&quot;You didn’t,&quot; Markus breathed, opening the bag to reveal golden-brown roasted chestnuts. His expression flickered between delight and nostalgia.
&quot;Stopped by the old stall,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Figured you’d appreciate it.&quot;
&quot;You really do know how to make a guy’s morning.&quot; Markus chuckled, popping one into his mouth and sighing contentedly. &quot;So, how’d it go? With Torrie, I mean.&quot;
&quot;Good. Aella still looks like Aella.&quot; Eddie exhaled, glancing past Markus as if he could still see the academy in the distance. &quot;Nothing much has changed since we were there.&quot;
Markus hummed, a small smile tugging at his lips. &quot;I bet she was buzzing with excitement.&quot;
&quot;Practically skipping through the gates,&quot; Eddie admitted with a chuckle.
Markus laughed, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, that sounds about right.&quot; He rolled up his sleeves, returning his focus to the potion before him. &quot;She’s gonna do great there, you know. Always knew she had it in her.&quot;
Eddie didn’t respond immediately, just nodded, watching the steam rise from Markus’s cauldron.
For a moment, it was like old times.
Eddie had just popped a chestnut into his mouth when Markus spoke, his voice casual but laced with meaning.
“Oh, by the way—Mr. Welton wants to see you earlier.”
Eddie froze mid-chew. A slow, creeping realization dawned on him.
He was supposed to hand over the formula today.
“Damn it—I forgot!” He shot upright,  swallowed hard, nearly choking. nearly knocking over a stack of parchment on the counter.
“Yeah, figured.” Markus raised an amused brow, still munching on his snack. “He’s already up at the tower.”
Cursing under his breath, Eddie spun on his heel and bolted toward the stairs. His boots thudded against the wooden steps as he rushed to his desk, rummaging through scattered notes, ink-stained pages, and unfinished drafts. Where the hell was it?
He shoved aside a worn-out alchemy textbook, and there it was—the carefully scribed formula, buried beneath a pile of old scribbles.
Snatching it up, he didn’t waste another second. He turned on his heel and sprinted towards the tower, heart pounding.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 10E</Title>
            <Text>The heavy steel door clicked shut behind them, plunging them into a wall of oppressive noise and stifling, humid air.
The room was a cavern of cages.
They were stacked from the damp concrete floor to the pipe-strewn ceiling, creating narrow, claustrophobic corridors. The air, thick with the musky stench of uncleaned enclosures and something sharp and chemical beneath it, was filled with a chaotic symphony of suffering. Hissing, screeching, guttural growls, and the desperate scrabbling of claws on metal echoed from every direction, so loud it was hard to think. The light was dim, coming from bare, flickering bulbs that cast long, dancing shadows, making it impossible to tell what lurked in the deeper recesses of the cages.
Most of the creatures were unlike anything Eddie had ever seen in a textbook. A cat-sized lizard with iridescent, feathery wings beat itself against the bars of its cage. A creature that looked like a tangle of roots with dozens of glittering black eyes coiled in a corner. The sheer wrongness of the place, a hidden menagerie of twisted and terrified life, was staggering.
Ashley let out a soft, horrified gasp, her eyes wide with pity and disgust. &quot;My God... what is all this?&quot;
Eddie ignored her, his adrenaline overriding the sensory assault. He grabbed Will's arm, his voice a harsh whisper that was nearly swallowed by the cacophony. &quot;Which way did they go?&quot;
Will, looking pale but focused, pointed down a long, narrow hallway formed by two towering rows of cages. &quot;Down there. They disappeared around the corner at the end. They didn't even look back.&quot;
&quot;Then we don't either,&quot; Eddie said, his expression grim. &quot;Stay quiet. Stay low.&quot;
He took the lead, moving with a practiced stealthiness, his feet making no sound on the grimy floor. Ashley followed, her staff held tight, trying her best not to look at the pleading, monstrous eyes that tracked them from the cages. Will brought up the rear, constantly glancing behind them, ensuring they weren't being followed.
They moved like ghosts through the maze of suffering. A large, ape-like creature with shadowy fur slammed a fist against its cage as they passed, the loud CLANG making them all freeze in place. They stood motionless for a full ten seconds, listening. Hearing nothing but the continued animalistic din, they pressed on.
Halfway down the hall, Eddie stopped dead. In a small cage at eye level sat a pathetic creature—a mangy fox with the legs of a spider grafted crudely onto its torso. It whimpered softly, a failed experiment cast aside. The sight of it, so close to the chimaera from his sketches, filled Eddie with a cold, righteous fury. This wasn't just a black market. It was a laboratory.
Will held up a hand, stopping them just before the corner. He peeked around it cautiously before pulling back. &quot;There's a door at the end of this next stretch,&quot; he whispered, his eyes dark with tension. &quot;A heavy one. There is a sound is coming from in there.&quot;
Moving as one, they crept down the final stretch of the corridor. The air was thick with humidity and the smell of ozone, mingling with the musky scent of the caged creatures.
As they neared the end, the voices became clearer. They could distinguish the low, authoritative rumble of Professor Hudson's, deferential tones of the young clerk from the shop front. They were on the other side of the door, their conversation muffled but a constant, menacing reminder of the danger.
The trio flattened themselves into a recess in the damp brick wall, right beside the source of the sound. The door was a solid slab of dark, rust-pitted steel, flush with the wall. Ashley ran a hand over its surface, searching for a seam or a lock.
&quot;There's nothing,&quot; she breathed, barely a whisper. &quot;No handle, no keyhole... I can’t pick this lock.&quot;
Will examined the edges, his street-smarts looking for a physical mechanism. &quot;She's right. It's completely smooth. It must be bolted from the inside.&quot;
&quot;It's a one-way door,&quot; Eddie said, his voice grim as the realization dawned. He looked at the impenetrable slab of metal, then back at his friends, his expression hardening with resolve. &quot;So we'll have to make our own way in.&quot;
While Will kept a nervous watch on the corridor behind them and Ashley stood guard with her staff, Eddie stepped up to the door. This was a job only he could do. He placed both palms flat against the cold steel, closing his eyes in concentration. He wasn't looking for a lock; he was feeling for the bolts. Four of them. Thick, heavy, and sunk deep within the door's internal mechanism.
&quot;I have to corrode them from the outside,&quot; he murmured, his focus absolute. &quot;Without making a sound. If I push too hard, the metal could screech when it gives way.&quot;
A sharp, thin transmutation circle of green light materialized on the door's surface, connecting his hands. Unlike his failed attempt on the enchanted lock outside, this door felt mundane, just brutally thick. The green light intensified, humming with contained power. He directed all his energy toward the top-right corner, where he'd felt the first bolt. The steel began to glow a faint cherry-red around the edges of the circle as its molecular structure started to break down.
The green light of Eddie's alchemy pulsed against the steel door, a silent, desperate battle against the thick metal. His face was slick with sweat, his jaw clenched in concentration. The air around the door grew warm, smelling of ozone and hot iron.
&quot;It's working,&quot; he gritted out, &quot;but it's slow.&quot;
A low, groaning sound began to emanate from the door, a deep metallic creak like a ship's hull under immense pressure. It was almost lost in the cacophony of the caged creatures, but to the trio, it was as loud as a scream.
&quot;Eddie, easy,&quot; Ashley whispered, her eyes wide, &quot;That noise...&quot;
&quot;I'm trying,&quot; he hissed back, &quot;The bolts are thicker than they look.&quot;

On the other side of the door, the environment was starkly different. The corridor was clean, sterile, and brightly lit with fluorescent tubes that hummed overhead. Professor Gareth Hudson walked along a row of clean, reinforced enclosures, his polished shoes clicking on the white-tiled floor. One of his fatigue-jacketed men followed a few paces behind.
&quot;The venom potency in this Naga specimen is remarkable,&quot; Hudson mused, tapping a finger on a data slate attached to a large, glass-fronted terrarium. Inside, a serpent with scales like iridescent jewels watched him with unblinking, intelligent eyes. &quot;Far superior to the last batch. Ensure its diet remains unchanged.&quot;
He moved to the next enclosure, which held a creature resembling a large civet, but with shimmering, almost invisible fur. &quot;And this one... its phasing ability is still unstable. We need to isolate the protein responsible. The military applications are too significant to ignore.&quot;
He paused, his head tilting slightly. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;
The clerk stopped. &quot;Hear what, sir? Just the animals in the back.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; Hudson said, his academic tone vanishing, replaced by sharp-edged command. &quot;That was different. A structural groan.&quot;
The groaning from the door grew louder. A high-pitched screech of tortured metal made them all flinch. Eddie was putting every ounce of his energy into the final bolt.
Will, who had his ear pressed against the cold steel, suddenly went rigid. His eyes flew open, wide with panic.
&quot;Eddie! He heard it! He's coming!&quot; he hissed, his voice cracking with urgency. &quot;I hear footsteps! He's coming to check the corridor!&quot;
Panic seized Eddie. He had one bolt left. There was no time for finesse. He shoved a final, desperate wave of alchemical energy into the door. The green light flared violently.
Hudson strode purposefully down the sterile white hallway, his expression a mask of stern suspicion. &quot;Stay here. I'll check the service corridor myself,&quot; he ordered his man.
His footsteps were brisk and measured as he approached the heavy steel door at the end of the hall—the very door the trio was fighting to open.
Professor Hudson rounded the corner into the grimy, cacophonous back-room corridor. He stopped, his sharp eyes scanning every detail. The rows of cages. The dripping pipes. The closed steel door. Everything looked exactly as it should.
He walked up to the service door and placed a hand on it. It was warm. Warmer than it should be. He narrowed his eyes, a flicker of deep suspicion crossing his face. But the corridor was empty. After a moment, he turned, his mind already moving on to other, more pressing security concerns.
On the other side of the door, Eddie, Will, and Ashley stood with their backs pressed against the cold steel, hearts hammering in their chests, trying not to make a sound. They were in.

            <Title>Chapter 3E V2</Title>
            <Text>The inn was warm, filled with the low hum of laughter and clinking mugs, a sharp contrast to the storm raging outside. The hearth crackled, sending flickers of light dancing across the wooden beams, but for Eddie, the warmth was suffocating. He sat slumped in the chair, drenched from head to toe, water pooling beneath him. His hair clung to his forehead, and his clothes felt like lead against his bruised and battered skin. He barely noticed the curious stares of the inn's patrons, their murmurs blending into the dull roar in his mind.
Will and Ashley sat beside him, no better off. Will’s usual carefree demeanor was gone; his eyes, shadowed with exhaustion, stared blankly at the table. Ashley fidgeted with her damp sleeves, her staff resting against her chair, her lips pressed into a thin line. None of them had spoken since Catherine ushered them inside.
Catherine, perched on the chair across from them, was unbothered by the stares or the gloom radiating from the trio. She leaned back slightly, her red coat hanging off her shoulders, her apple-red hair catching the light. Despite the gravity of the situation, she still managed a faint smirk, trying to bring some levity into the room.
Her bright red coat and sharp features made her stand out even among the colorful inn patrons, but her easy demeanor somehow blended into the room’s warmth. She tapped a finger lightly on the wooden table, leaning forward with an attempt at levity.
“Well,” she began, her tone playful, “This is the most cheerful company I’ve had in decades. Honestly, Eddie, you’ve always been a barrel of laughs, but this? This is new.”
Her words fell flat. Eddie didn’t flinch, his expression unchanging. Will shifted slightly in his seat, but the faintest twitch at the corner of his mouth didn’t develop further. Even Ashley, who might have offered a polite smile, seemed too burdened by the events to respond. Catherine sighed theatrically, throwing up her hands.
“Really? Nothing? Not even a chuckle? Tough crowd,” she muttered, leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms. “Alright then, I’ll skip the pleasantries. Someone better tell me what’s got the three of you looking like ghosts.”
The silence lingered for a moment before Ashley finally spoke, her voice quiet but steady. “We were visiting a friend—Madeleine,” she explained, staring down at the table. “But... she was taken. Kidnapped.”
Catherine’s eyes sharpened, her playful demeanor fading. “By who?” she asked, her tone low and serious.
Ashley hesitated, searching for the right words. “They were in black cloaks. Hooded. There were three of them. Two of them attacked us, and... they overpowered us.” Her hands clenched into fists as she spoke, her frustration evident. “They called Madeleine by name. It wasn’t random. They were after her.”
Catherine’s brow furrowed as she leaned in closer. “Did they say anything about why? Or who they are?”
Ashley shook her head. “No, but... there’s this.” She reached into her bag, pulling out a small silver necklace and placing it on the table. The pendant was unmistakable: a grim skull resting in an outstretched hand. “One of them—the woman—had it on her. When she attacked me with her dagger, I managed to grab this before... before it all went wrong.”
Catherine turned the pendant over in her hand, her sharp gaze analyzing every detail. The faint flicker of lamplight danced across the grim sigil: a skull cradled in a skeletal hand. Her brows furrowed, and a heavy silence hung in the air as she seemed to weigh her thoughts carefully. Finally, she exhaled, setting the pendant down on the table with an audible clink.
“This,” she began, her voice low and grave, “isn’t just any insignia. This is the mark of the Black Hand.”
Ashley tilted her head, puzzled. “The Black Hand? Who are they?”
Catherine leaned back, her fingers interlocking as she regarded the three of them. “They’re an underground organization—centuries old, possibly older. Assassins, spies, mercenaries... whatever you want to call them, they’ve been pulling strings from the shadows for longer than most can remember.” Her voice softened, her tone heavy with the weight of her words. “I’ve crossed paths with them a few centuries ago. Trust me, they’re not the sort you want to make enemies of.”
Will straightened in his seat, concern flashing across his face. “How bad are we talking?”
Catherine gave him a pointed look. “The kind of bad that means they don’t leave loose ends. Their operatives are trained from a young age to be precise, efficient, and utterly ruthless. They don’t fail their missions. If you’re lucky, you never even see them coming.” She tapped the pendant with her fingertip. “This? This isn’t just a necklace. It’s proof of their presence—a rare slip-up.”
Ashley swallowed hard. “So... we’re dealing with assassins? That’s who took Madeleine?”
Catherine nodded solemnly. “If this sigil is involved, yes. And the fact that you three managed to survive an encounter with them...” She paused, her expression a mix of disbelief and admiration. “That’s no small feat. Not many in my very long existence can say they’ve faced the Black Hand and lived to tell the tale.”
Eddie, who had been silent up to this point, finally raised his head. His eyes were still bloodshot, his voice rough. “Then why didn’t they kill us? They had the chance. Walther...” His voice broke slightly, but he pushed through. “He could’ve finished me off. Why didn’t he?”
Catherine tilted her head, her sharp mind visibly turning over the question. “That, I can’t say for sure. But if I had to guess? They didn’t see you as a threat—not yet, anyway.” She shot Eddie a meaningful look. “Or maybe Walther had his reasons for sparing you.”
Will frowned, leaning forward. “But Madeleine... why her? What could they possibly want with her?”
Catherine’s lips pressed into a thin line. “The Black Hand doesn’t take people on a whim. If they’ve gone through the trouble of abducting Madeleine, then she’s part of something much larger. Something that’s likely been in motion for a long time.”
Ashley’s hands clenched into fists. “So what do we do? How do we stop them?”
Catherine’s gaze softened as she looked at the three of them. “First, we thank whatever gods and goddesses you believe that you managed to snag this.” She gestured to the pendant. “Whoever attacked you was likely a rookie. A veteran operative wouldn’t have let you anywhere near something like this. The fact that you’re alive and still have this pendant is nothing short of a miracle.”
She leaned forward, her expression darkening. “Second, we tread carefully. The Black Hand doesn’t take kindly to interference, and now that you’ve disrupted their plans, you can bet they’ll be watching.”
Eddie’s hands trembled slightly as he stared at the pendant on the table. His voice was low, but there was a hard edge to it. “I don’t care how dangerous they are. I’m going to find Madeleine, Where would they take her?”
Catherine, sitting with an uncharacteristically serious expression, looked down at the pendant in her hand. “Did they leave any clues? Anything at all?”
Eddie paused, the rain-drenched events replaying in his mind. His jaw clenched as he tried to recall every detail. “They... they said something. Walther told them to leave me behind because ‘the boy will come for her.’ And then he said...” Eddie hesitated, the memory sharp and bitter. “He said ‘Lord Raven will be pleased.’”
The air in the room seemed to shift. Catherine, who had faced magical beasts and survived countless dangers in her long life, visibly stiffened. Her usual humor and ease dissolved, replaced by an uncharacteristic tension. Her grip on the pendant tightened, and for a moment, she said nothing, her face pale.
Eddie frowned, noticing her reaction. “Catherine? What is it? Why are you acting like this?”
Even Will and Ashley, who had been quiet, looked at her with concern. Catherine, the unflappable Master Alchemist, was visibly unnerved.
Finally, she let out a slow, deliberate breath, her voice low. “Lord Raven...” she began, her words laced with dread. “He’s not just anyone. He’s the right hand of the Black Hand, their enforcer. If he’s involved, this isn’t just some rogue faction or a simple kidnapping.”
Eddie’s brow furrowed. “Why? What makes him so terrifying? You’ve faced dragons, ancient magic, everything. What’s different about him?”
Catherine hesitated, her eyes darting to the pendant again, as though it held the answers she sought. “Lord Raven isn’t just a name, Eddie. He’s a title—a mantle passed down through generations of the Black Hand. Each Lord Raven is chosen for their absolute loyalty and unparalleled skill. The current one...” She trailed off, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “He’s the one who orchestrated the Regicide.”
Ashley’s eyes widened. “The Regicide? You mean the downfall of the Edenfield Monarch?”
Catherine nodded grimly. “It was more than a downfall. The Edenfield royal family was wiped out in a single night—every heir, every cousin, every branch of the bloodline. All of it orchestrated by the Black Hand, with Lord Raven leading the charge. He didn’t just plan it; he carried out much of it himself. No one survived.”
Eddie’s heart sank, a chill running through him. “But... why would someone like that want Madeleine? What could she possibly have to do with this?”
Catherine shook her head, her expression unreadable. “That’s the question, isn’t it? If the Black Hand and Lord Raven are involved, it means Madeleine is tied to something far larger than you realize. Something they’ve been planning for a long time.”
Eddie leaned forward, his voice sharper now, tinged with desperation. “Catherine, you must have an idea. Where would they take her? You’ve dealt with them before.”
Catherine, still holding the pendant, sighed heavily. She sat back in her chair, her eyes distant, as if reaching into memories she’d rather forget. “If Lord Raven is involved, and if they’ve taken her, there’s only one place they’d go,” she said grimly. “The Underground City beneath the Citadel of Archaea.”
Eddie frowned. “The Underground City? What’s that?”
“It’s not a place most people even know exists,” Catherine explained. “The Citadel of Archaea is the heart of Solivia’s capital, the seat of its government, and the symbol of its might. But beneath it lies a buried remnant of the original citadel, the parts that were left behind when the new one was built. Over centuries, that forgotten ruin became a city of its own.”
Ashley furrowed her brow. “A city underground? Who lives there?”
“Criminals,” Catherine said bluntly. “Gangs, thieves, assassins. Every type of outlaw imaginable. It’s a haven for those who don’t want to live under Solivia’s laws. The Solivian Police and Army barely touch it—it’s too vast, too lawless, and they don’t have the resources to enforce order down there. So, they’ve left it to the criminals.”
Will, still pale and shaken, leaned forward. “And you’re saying the Black Hand... their headquarters is there?”
Catherine nodded. “If they’re carrying out an operation under Lord Raven’s direct orders, that’s where they’ll take her. The Underground City is a labyrinth, and the Black Hand’s headquarters is at its core. It’s the one place no outsider dares to go.”
Ashley’s voice broke through the tension. “Maybe we should report this to the police. If the Black Hand is as dangerous as you say, shouldn’t the authorities handle it? The army, or—”
Catherine cut her off with a sharp laugh, though there was no humor in it. “You don’t understand, my dear. The police? The army? They fear the Black Hand. Reporting this would be a waste of time. It’d sit on a dusty backlog in their office until it’s forgotten—if it isn’t already. The Underground is a no-go zone for them. No one enforces laws there. No one dares.”
Ashley frowned, disbelief plain on her face. “Then what do we do? Just let them get away with it?”
Eddie’s voice rang out with a quiet resolve. “We go there.”
The room fell silent. Will and Ashley stared at Eddie as though he’d lost his mind. Even Catherine paused, her sharp eyes narrowing as she studied him.
Will finally broke the silence. “Eddie, mate, are you serious? Do you even hear yourself? This isn’t just sneaking out to grab a midnight snack. You’re talking about walking into a city full of killers.”
Ashley crossed her arms, her voice rising. “He’s right! You don’t even know where to start. How could you possibly think this is a good idea?”
Eddie didn’t waver. “I don’t care how dangerous it is. Madeleine is down there. I’m going, whether you like it or not.”
Catherine sighed deeply, rubbing her temples as if a headache had just arrived. “Eddie, listen to me. I understand your anger, your determination. But the Underground isn’t like anything you’ve faced before. It’s chaos. A world of its own. You can’t just walk in there and demand answers.”
“Then guide us,” Eddie said, his voice firm. “You said you’ve been there before. Help us get through it.”
Catherine blinked, startled by his boldness. “That was a long time ago, I need you to understand something: I’ve been to the Underground before. Back during the reign of King Gereon the Just, I was sent there with a party of paladins when the crown still foolishly believed it could bring order to that cesspool.” Her voice turned cold, distant. “We barely made it out alive, and that was with trained warriors at my side. The king gave up on the Underground for a reason.”
“But you’ve been there,” Eddie pressed. “You know the way.”
Catherine hesitated. She looked at him, her sharp gaze softening with something close to understanding. “You’re as stubborn as your father was,” she muttered. “I suppose there’s no talking you out of this, is there?”
Eddie didn’t flinch. “No.”
Catherine exhaled, a long and weary sound. “Fine. I’ll take you. But you need to understand—there are parts of the Underground even I can’t go to. Especially now. Elves aren’t exactly welcome down there.”
“Why not?” Ashley asked.
“The people down there don’t just hate authority—they hate outsiders, especially Elves. They see us as symbols of oppression from centuries past, relics of the Solivian Empire that once enslaved their ancestors and cast them to the ground. There are places where my presence would make things worse for all of us.”
Will raised a skeptical brow. “Wait, you’re actually agreeing to this? Just like that?”
“Yes, I am.” Catherine’s gaze flicked between the three of them, her expression unreadable. Then, a sly smile crept across her face. 
“But… why?” Ashley asked,
The fire crackled. Catherine’s smile faded. She turned the Black Hand’s pendant over in her fingers, her nails—unnaturally sharp—tapping the skull’s hollow eye sockets. Clink. Clink. Clink.
“A week ago,” she said at last, “I received a letter from my peers at Edenfield. They’d decoded something… troubling.” Her eyes lifted, glowing faintly in the hearthlight. “A forbidden codex. Translated from proto-elven.”
Eddie stiffened. “Codex Chilandar?” The name tasted like ash. The one she’d warned him about years ago, in stories meant to scare him into studying harder.
Catherine nodded.
“What’s in it?” Will demanded.
The pendant stilled in her grip. For a breath, the only sound was the rain lashing the inn’s windows. Then—
“Black magic.” Her voice was a whisper, but it carved through the room like a blade. “We thought it was Alchemy, or at least a derivatives of it, but we were wrong... It was Necromancy.”
Silence.
Ashley’s hand flew to her mouth. Will’s knuckles whitened around his mug. Eddie felt the word slither down his spine, cold and alive.
“And it was stolen,” Catherine added. She leaned, her chair scraping against the floorboards. “I must retrieve it before they learn its secrets. And destroy it—” Her sharp teeth flashed. “—before anyone understands it fully.”
“But if I help you…” She added, “I want something in return.”
The room fell silent. Eddie frowned, suspicion flaring. “What do you mean? What do you want?”
“Oh, nothing too dramatic,” Catherine said airily, but her tone carried a strange weight, a sense of purpose that made all three of them uneasy. “Just a favor. Something I’ll collect later.”
Ashley leaned forward, her voice cautious. “What kind of favor?”
Catherine smiled, leaning back in her chair and twirling the pendant between her fingers. “Don’t worry your pretty little heads about it. You’ll find out when the time comes.” Her sharp teeth flashed in a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Do we have a deal?”
Eddie hesitated but then nodded firmly. “We do.”
“Good,” Catherine said, her voice light but her smile mysterious. “Then let’s prepare to descend into the shadows. You’ll need all the help you can get.” </Text>
            <Notes>Explain that Catherine came due to a report of a Codex being stolen, it was the Codex with forbidden knowledge in it.

She has to get it back before the knowledge goes to the wrong hand

(She will probably end up destroying the codex)</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 10</Title>
            <Text>A couple of days had passed since that night, it is Sunday morning now, despite that fact, the word from Catherine still hadn’t left Eddie’s mind at all, it kept spinning, and playing like a broken record in his mind, mocking him in his futile attempt at hiding his passion for Alchemy.
The living room of the Welton’s household is cozy today, the low table cluttered with herbs and parchments. The warm morning lights casts a ray of sunshine shimmering through between the curtains, casting onto the mismatched furniture where Eddie sat. Torrie sat across from him sprawling on the carpet, her legs kicking as she flipped through her notebook, her wand resting on top of her ears as she flipped through her notes.
“So,” She said, breaking the silence, “You were at Vandruff’s Travelling Puppet Show last night, weren’t you, Eddie?” Torrie teased, her voice was sing-song in tone.
“What? No! Of course not!” Eddie countered, “What makes you think that?”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Torrie’s smirk widened, “Maybe because my classmate’s brother who worked part-time as a ticket seller with Mr. Vandruff said he saw someone with a dishevelled silver hair sitting in the back row, looking all serious and broody. It was nothing he had ever seen before! An adult in a kid’s travelling puppet show! Sounds familliar?” She continued her tease, her grin widening.
Eddie groaned, covering his face with Torrie’s Alchemy Textbook, his groan muffled. “Look, there are plenty of people with dishevelled silver hair who enjoy puppet shows, alright? Leave them alone!” he muttered, the sound still muffled by his textbook.
Torrie laughed, her legs kicking before she sat up, “Oh come on, Eddie! You’re a terrible liar! You’ve got that look, you know? Just admit you’ve been there!”
“Look,” Eddie shot back, putting down the textbook that has been hiding his face, “Do you want help with your homework or not? If not, I’ve got better things to do.”
Her laughter softened into a giggle, “Fine, fine. But seriously, what’s so bad about going to a puppet show anyway? They’re so fun!”
Eddie lets out a long sigh, running a hand through his hair—an unintentional act that only made it messier. “It’s not about that, Torrie. It’s just… you know what, never mind. Let’s focus on your homework, okay?”
“Alright then, grumpy.” Torrie said with a mock pout, then joined Eddie on the low table.
But before Eddie could start working on the first assignment, the front door opened, he had expected it to be his father coming home early from shopping for ingredients, but as the front door opens, it was someone he didn’t expect.
It was Markus.
Eddie glanced up, clearly puzzled. It was Sunday morning—Markus isn't supposed to be working today. His expression softened as Markus set down a small bag of supplies and adjusted his jacket. 
“Oh hey Markus.” Eddie greeted, slightly raising an eyebrow, “What’s going on? It’s Sunday, you’re supposed to be on break, right? Or were you transferred to weekend shift or something?”
“Oh hey Eddie,” Markus greeted back sheepishly, “Sorry I forgot to give you a heads up.”
“It’s alright,” Eddie chuckled, “What’s on your mind today? You wanna help Torrie with her homework with me?”
“Oh no, I’m good, I’m not really good with that stuff.” Markus said, settling on the chair by the door, “The Elf lady called me yesterday, saying that she needed me for something, willing to give me something for the trouble too! Generous, right?”
“Oh wow, that’s interesting--” But something caught Eddie’s attention, a discrepancy.
“Wait… Elf Lady?” Eddie blinked, “What Elf Lady?”
“You know… Man, I forgot her name, but red hair? Short? Red coat? She almost wear all-red now that you mention it.”
“Wait…” Eddie tries to dig his brains for faces, “Catherine?”
“Yes! That’s the one, the Catherine fellow called me.”
“What the bloody hell does Catherine wants with you, Markus?” Eddie said, puzzled, “Hope she didn’t tangle you in her shady businesses, She’s a pretty shady person if you can see through her wacky personality.”
“Oh, nothing shady, but she mentions something about an Adventure, though.”
Eddie’s heart drops, an Adventure… wait… does this mean…
“No, no, no…” Eddie muttered under his breath, “Are you sure she said adventure? She can’t be that vague right?”
“Well, she is pretty vague, but I’m sure-“
“Hey Markus!” Torrie interjected, “Did Aunt Catherine invite you too?! She was gathering a party to go on an epic adventure to the woods! She said I can come by!”
Wait, wait, wait. Eddie thought, his mind beginning to spiral.
“Wait, Torrie. What are you talking about?” Eddie said
“Didn’t you know, Eddie? Aunt Catherine is gathering an adventure party!”
But before Eddie could respond, the door opened once more, he couldn’t make of the face at first due to the bright morning light, but from the silhouette it was clear. Short hair, and sharp, elven ear.
It was Catherine
“Mornin’ everyone!” She chirped, &quot;Well, I see everyone is here,&quot; she continued, setting down the bags of grocery on the low table. She turned to Eddie with a teasing glint in her eye. &quot;What's all this fuss about?&quot; 
“Catherine, you’ve gotta adress something for me.” Eddie said sternly, his face is a mix of confusion and frustation, “What the hell is going on. Why is Markus clocking in on a Sunday morning, and most importantly. Why are you involving my fucking sister into this?”
“Language, Eddie!” Torrie shouted from the low table.
“Well, firstly.” Catherine said, her tone is matter-factly, “I said a few days ago, right? I was planning an excursion to the Deep Glaive. It wouldn’t be a balanced party if was just two Alchemists isn’t it? So I decided to recruit more!”
“You what?!” Eddie shouted, standing abruptly. Textbooks pens and notebook falling down to the low table.
“What’s wrong, Ed?! She said it will be an exciting adventure! There’s nothing wrong with it!” Torrie plead
“Look, there is so many things wrong with this, Torrie. Firstly, you are involved! Do you know how dangerous this is?!”
“Oh, I think you’re overthinking this, Edward.” Catherine said, brushing off her hands in front of her face, “It’ll be just a little adventure! A bit of detour, if you will. I mean- come on, you were exploring an even more dangerous dungeons when you were her age!”
“Look, Catherine. It’s different, she’s different!”
“She’ll be fine.” Catherine said, “It’ll be like the old times!”
Eddie's heart sank. He looked at his little sister, who was still so young, so eager to prove herself. He glanced at Catherine, the woman who had once been his mentor and aunt, now standing so confidently before him, acting like nothing was wrong. 
 He opened his mouth to argue again, but then he turned to his mother, Alyssa Welton. Who just entered to the kitchen across the room, hoping for some sense. &quot;Mom!&quot; he called out, his voice tinged with frustration. &quot;Are you listening? Are you okay with this? Why isn't anyone thinking straight about this?&quot; 
Alyssa, who had been arranging the groceries Catherine just bought, turned around, her expression warm but unreadable. &quot;I trust Catherine. She's always been dependable in her way. She gets you in and out of dungeons in the past, although I can argue all I want, I know she’ll find her way to get you guys out. Let’s just say if she's confident, this will work out, I believe her.&quot; 
Eddie stared at her. &quot;You believe her? Just like that? What happened to thinking things through? What happened to being cautious?&quot; 
Alyssa smiled softly as she took out a carrot out of the grocery bag and putting it on the chopping board, “Eddie, sometimes you have to trust people and take a leap. You haven’t gone to adventures like these since Alfred goes to the army haven’t you?”
“In fact,” She continued, her chopping sounded harder against the carrots.
“If anything happens to any of you..”
Chop,
“I can just hold a certain Elf accountable can I?”
Another chop,
Catherine lets out a deep gulp, “Y-you heard your mother, Edward.” She said, “I’ll make sure to keep you guys safe!”
Alyssa’s chopping began to soften again, “If you are going, Eddie. You'd better get prepared. You should have your things ready in the garage.&quot; 
Eddie felt a sharp sting in his chest. Was his mother, the one who always kept a careful eye on things, saying this? He wasn't sure if it was reassuring or terrifying. His mind was still racing, caught between his fears and the urge to protect his family from the reckless dangers that seemed spiralling out of control. 
He clenched his fists, turning to Catherine again. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said gritting his teeth. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 4E V2</Title>
            <Text>The room was quiet, save for the soft rustling of the bed sheets as Catherine shifted in her sleep. She was sprawled across Eddie’s bottom bunk, her bright red coat tucked haphazardly under her, and her head nestled against the pillow as if she belonged there. The hum of the dormitory outside didn’t faze her, despite the oddity of the situation—an Elf, the Master Alchemist, and most importantly, Eddie’s aunt, napping in their cramped dorm room.
Ashley stood in the doorway, staring at Catherine with her arms crossed, blinking in disbelief. “Really?” she said, her voice laced with a mixture of amusement and frustration.
Will, who was leaning against the opposite wall, let out a low whistle. “Did she really just want a free place to sleep?”
“Yeah,” Eddie sighed, sitting on the edge of his bed, rubbing his face. “That is very Catherine of her.”
Ashley looked at him with a smirk. “You didn’t see that coming?”
“I should’ve,” Eddie muttered. “She’s been around long enough to know how to work people... but I guess this is a new level.”
As the two of them exchanged amused glances, the door to their dorm room creaked open, and in stepped Jake and Jane, two of Eddie’s more curious classmates. They froze mid-step when they saw Catherine still snoring away on the bottom bunk.
“HOLY SHIT, is that an elf? A real elf?” Jane exclaimed, eyes wide with disbelief. She tiptoed closer to get a better look, her mouth hanging open. “You sure her ears aren’t just a costume or something?”
Jake, who was standing behind her, elbowed her. “Dude, that’s definitely an elf. You can’t fake pointy ears like that!”
Before Jane could argue further, Henry, another dorm mate, appeared in the doorway, rolling his eyes. “Oh, for the love of the gods, will you two keep it down?” He crossed his arms and looked at Jake and Jane with an exasperated sigh. “You’re embarrassing yourselves. Go bother someone else.”
Jake and Jane turned around sheepishly, glancing back at Catherine one last time. “You’ve gotta admit, this is wild,” Jake muttered as they backed out of the room.
Henry stepped forward, now clearly intent on a more serious matter. “Anyway, Eddie,” he said, nodding toward the trio, “I need to talk to you, Will, and Ashley. Important stuff. Can we have a word?”
Will gave Henry a curious look. “Sure, what’s up?”
Henry glanced at Catherine briefly before rolling his eyes. “Maybe not in front of the elf.”
Eddie looked over at Catherine, still snoozing peacefully, blissfully unaware of the circus she’d caused. He sighed. “No point in waking her up. She’s not going anywhere.”
Ashley chuckled softly. “It’s funny, isn’t it? The most powerful alchemist in the world, and all she wanted was a nap and a free bed.”
“Well,” Eddie began, his lips curling into a half-smile, “I guess that's Catherine for you. Always knows how to get what she wants, even if it’s just... peace and quiet for a change.”
Will shook his head, the humor of the situation finally sinking in. &quot;She’s definitely a piece of work. What kind of Master Alchemist needs a nap in a college dorm?&quot;
Eddie glanced at his bunkmate, who was still deep in her slumber, a soft snore escaping her. &quot;You really want to know?&quot; He grinned. &quot;The kind who just blew all her money on something completely impractical and now needs a place to crash.&quot;
Ashley’s face lit up in sudden realization, and she laughed. “She’s broke, isn’t she?”
“She’s... incredibly resourceful,” Eddie said, throwing a glance at Catherine as if to make sure she wouldn’t suddenly wake up and punch him for revealing her secret. “But yeah, I guess if you ask Catherine what she wants... it’s probably a bed, food, and a place where she can steal some quiet time without being chased by angry royalty or criminals.”
As Henry and the others looked on, Eddie couldn’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. “I swear, I never saw that one coming. But maybe we can be the ones who make sure she gets her sleep. It’s the least we can do for a family member who’s literally saving our lives.”
And as Catherine continued to sleep, the mystery of her request—a mysterious favor—seemed far less menacing. In that moment, Eddie realized something: Catherine’s true price was something as simple and relatable as a little comfort after an untold number of years spent doing everything but resting.
But that, Eddie thought, was just the way she liked it.

-o-

The dorm’s dining room was dimly lit, a few oil lamps flickering as the storm outside continued to rage. Henry leaned casually against the counter in the small kitchen nook, his arms crossed, his face a mix of curiosity and concern. Across from him, Eddie, Will, and Ashley shifted uncomfortably in their seats, their expressions grim. Eddie’s clothes were still damp, the occasional drip hitting the floor beneath him.
“So,” Henry began, his gaze narrowing, “What in the gods’ names is going on? I mean, it’s not every day you see an elf—an elf—crashing in Room 3 like it’s the most normal thing in the world.” His voice carried an edge of disbelief. “I thought they only existed in fairy tales and those old religious books back home. What’s happened?”
Eddie’s hands gripped the edge of the table, his knuckles white. He opened his mouth to speak but hesitated, his jaw tightening. The words seemed stuck in his throat, and his gaze dropped to the wooden grain of the table.
Sensing Eddie’s discomfort, Ashley stepped in. “Let’s start with the elf,” she said, her tone composed, though the faintest trace of a smirk played on her lips. “Her name’s Catherine. She’s Eddie’s old friend.”
Henry arched an eyebrow, his intrigue deepening. “His… friend?”
Eddie finally looked up, forcing a weak smile. “Yeah. My mom and Catherine have been close since they were kids. My mom used to call her ‘her sister from another lifetime.’ Catherine’s always been around, visiting from time to time.”
Something in Henry's posture softened. He exhaled through his nose. &quot;Alright. So your maybe-aunt is an elf. Fine. But that doesn't explain—&quot; He gestured at Eddie's singed sleeves, Ashley's white-knuckled grip on her staff, the way Will kept flexing his left hand like the fingers still tingled from discharged magic. &quot;What the hell happened tonight?&quot;
The silence that followed was broken only by the rain hammering the windows. Eddie stared at the water pooling around his boots. One drop. Two. Three.
Then Ashley said quietly, &quot;They took Madeleine.&quot;
Henry's body reacted before his face did—his shoulders locking, fists clenching so tight the tendons stood out like bowstrings. For a heartbeat, Eddie thought he might actually drive his fist through the wall. But when Henry spoke, his voice was terrifyingly calm. &quot;Alright.&quot; A muscle twitched in his jaw. &quot;Who is it? We can go after him.&quot;
Eddie watched a droplet fall from his sleeve and splatter on the floorboards. &quot;It's not just one person...&quot;
&quot;A group of folks?&quot; Henry's boot tapped an uneven rhythm against the floor.
Will's chair creaked as he leaned forward. &quot;No. It's an organization.&quot; He met Henry's gaze squarely. &quot;Called the Black Hand.&quot;
The name hit like a thunderclap. Henry's control shattered—he spun away, kicking a chair across the room. It slammed into the pantry door with a crack that echoed through the dorm.
Henry's control shattered—he spun away, unleashing a guttural, bilabial curse that sounded from deep in his throat. The Alamirian dialect rolled harshly off his tongue as he curses.
&quot;Fucking hell!&quot; He braced both hands on the counter, head bowed. When he turned back, his eyes were wild. &quot;Do you even know what you're dealing with?&quot;
Ashley's staff clattered to the floor. Will went very still. Even the storm seemed to hold its breath.
Eddie stood slowly, water still dripping from his clothes. &quot;We know enough.&quot; His voice was quiet, but it carried. &quot;And we're going after her.&quot;
Henry drew a long breath through his nose, visibly wrestling his anger back under control. When he turned to Ashley, his movements were deliberate - the careful composure of someone clinging to rationality. &quot;Ash,&quot; he said, voice strained but steady, &quot;You're with the Campus Watch. Tell me you've heard something about this.&quot;
Ashley's fingers tightened around her staff. The lamplight caught the worry lines around her eyes as she spoke. &quot;We have gotten reports about... disappearances. We helped print posters to be plastered across the city.&quot; She swallowed hard. &quot;Some were wearing university cloaks in their photos.&quot;
The revelation hung heavy in the air. Henry's shoulders slumped as years of half-noticed patterns suddenly clicked into place. &quot;I always thought...&quot; He ran a hand through his hair, dislodging droplets of rainwater. &quot;The rumors about stressed alchemy students dropping out, vanishing after exams... Gods, we joked about it in the dorms.&quot;
Will's chair scraped as he leaned forward. &quot;Turns out the real joke's on us, huh?&quot; His attempt at humor fell flat, the usual twinkle in his eyes replaced by something harder.
Henry's gaze drifted to the storm-lashed window, his reflection fractured in the rain-streaked glass. &quot;How long has this been happening?&quot; The question seemed to echo in the cramped dining room, bouncing off the peeling wallpaper and worn floorboards.
Ashley's voice dropped to a whisper. &quot;Longer than any of us realized. The Watch has files dating back five years, but-&quot;
&quot;But no one connected the dots,&quot; Eddie finished bitterly. His damp sleeve left a dark streak as he wiped condensation from the windowpane, revealing the blurred lights of the university through the downpour. &quot;Not until they took someone we cared about.&quot;
The rain-streaked window reflected their exhausted faces as silence settled over the group. Eddie's breath fogged the glass where he'd wiped it clean, the university lights beyond blurring into golden smears like alchemical symbols half-remembered.
Will broke the quiet first, his usual bravado dulled by fatigue. &quot;What do we do now?&quot; His fingers tapped an uneven rhythm against his thigh - the same restless tempo Henry's boot had made earlier.
Henry exhaled through his nose, the sound heavy with the weight of responsibility. &quot;We wait till morning.&quot; He rubbed the bridge of his nose where his glasses usually sat. &quot;I'll contact the Faculty Council at first light. Someone there must...&quot; His voice trailed off, the unspoken 'must know something' hanging between them.
Ashley nodded, her activist instincts surfacing through the weariness. &quot;I'll talk to Campus Watch too.&quot; She worried her lower lip. &quot;They've been tracking disappearances longer than anyone. There might be patterns we're missing.&quot;
Eddie remained silent, his palm pressed against the cold glass. Somewhere out there in the storm, Madeleine was being taken further away with each passing second. The thought made his stomach churn.
Will's chair creaked as he leaned forward. &quot;And if they don't know anything? If they won't help?&quot; The question none of them wanted to voice.
The oil lamps guttered, stretching their shadows across the walls like grasping hands. Henry met Will's gaze squarely. &quot;Then we do it anyway.&quot;
A silent understanding passed between them - the kind forged in dorm rooms and midnight study sessions, now tempered by something darker. They would sleep tonight, but come morning, they would step into shadows deeper than any of them had imagined.
Ashley reached out, squeezing Eddie's shoulder. &quot;We'll find her.&quot; The certainty in her voice almost made it believable.
Eddie finally turned from the window, his eyes reflecting the lamplight like twin flames. &quot;Yeah.&quot; It wasn't agreement so much as a vow.
One by one, they pushed back from the table, the weight of tomorrow already settling on their shoulders. The storm outside raged on, but for now, there was nothing to do but wait - and hope the dawn would bring answers instead of more disappearances.</Text>

            <Title>Prologue</Title>
            <Text>“By the gods! H-his face!”
The scream echoes through the room so loud it turned the raucous classroom dead silent. 
All eyes are now towards the three boys in the middle of the classroom, the eyes who were only few, now looked at him. The classroom smelt of books, papers, chalks and blood.
The first boy knelt on the coarse floorboards, clutching his face as blood oozed through the crevices of his finger, screaming in agony, whining, begging.
His cries are muffled by the hand clutching his bloodied face, a piece of wood with an intricate silver engravings, a Wand. It’s about an inch long, lies on the floorboards, the glowing runes dissipates.
The second boy stood over him shielding the third, his breath came in a fast, rapid succession. Chest weaving, fist clenched on his own wand. His Wand looks like a mere driftwood from afar, the boy clenched on his wand with his dear life.
“E-Eddie?” the third boy stammered, tapping the shoulder of the second boy who is called Eddie.
“S-stay back Markus,” Eddie said, “I’ve got this-“
“No…” The boy called Markus said, “Eddie… his face…”
It was then Eddie was brought back from his high surge of adrenaline from the fight, the duel. It was then Eddie realised that he might have won… in a condition where he shouldn’t have.
“Wh-what have you done?” Markus voice was whispery and coarse.
A harsh clunk, Eddie dropped his wand, not in defeat but in horror of what he just saw. Hand covering his mouth. 
Eddie tries to get closer to the first boy trying to see the wound, trying to help, but then-
“Get away!” The girl screamed at him, pushing Eddie before kneeling to check on the first boy, “You fucking monster! Get away!”
What have I done, Eddie probably thought to himself. As he looked around the classroom, and see what happened. All the student is circling on him, some taking out their phones to take a photo or record what happened.
“Did you see the spell that he use?” One boy whispered as he clutch his phone, recording, “Is that even a spell?”
“Isn’t it obvious…” Another girl said, “It’s black magic! His mother is a witch, of course he uses it.”
“Yeah…. Look at him”
“This is serious… Someone call the headmaster! Now!”
Eddie knows he had to do something… help the boy, escape, say something to his classmates to put some sense into them… pleading his own innocence.
But Eddie just stood there frozen, horrified by everything.
When the door burst in, when the procession of teachers, nurses and healers rush in, Eddie hadn’t left his spot nor said anything since. Eddie saw as the nurses and healers lifted the First Boy into a stretcher, still screaming and whining, clutching his face as they carried him away out of the classroom into the nurse station. Some students followed him, the event of the duel had disrupted the schedule so much so that everything is in chaos.
A firm hand landed on his shoulder, Eddie looked up.
The Headmaster stayed there, taking the wand that has just fallen, and then said to him. 
“Everything is going to be okay.”
Eddie wanted to believe him… but there is no way.
He barely notices when the other teachers took his wand away from the headmaster, Eddie felt somewhat free when they took the wand away… as if the weight of the mountain itself has been lifted from his shoulders… it felt somewhat liberating. And he dreaded that feeling.
They led Eddie out of the classroom, the Headmaster followed suit.
In the corridor, heads peaked out of the classrooms, looking at Eddie. Whispers followed him throughout the corridor. Muttering what would be Eddie’s fate.
He spent years under this very institutions, Aella Academy. Studying, pushing himself, and proving himself that he is worth to be learning the Alchemical Tradition.
And now, slowly, step by step. It all being stripped away. Death by a thousand cuts.
At the end of the hallway there is the Headmaster’s Office, a place of judgment.
He knew his sentence had already passed long before it all happened.
Edward Welton is going to be expelled.

            <Title>Chapter 1</Title>
            <Text>Seven years.
The past had settled like dust, left undisturbed by time. 
And in its place, 
A new beginning bloomed.
A girl stood before a tall mirror, adjusting the brim of her pointed black hat. Her long, silky brown hair swayed in twin tails as she tilted her head, inspecting her reflection with wide, eager eyes behind oversized round glasses. A yellow knit sweater peeked out from beneath the freshly pressed folds of an Aella Academy robe.
She grinned.
The robe. The hat. The feeling of it all—it was real. She was finally going to Aella. She was finally going to learn the arts and traditions of magic… She is going to be a magician. 
Her heart swelled with excitement, her fingers tracing the embroidered crest on her robe. Today was the first step toward something wonderful.
A voice carried through the house, breaking her reverie.
“Torrie! Breakfast is ready! Come to the dining room!”
She spun away from the mirror, practically bouncing on her feet.
“Yes, Mom!” she called back, already rushing toward the door.
Torrie stepped into the dining room, the scent of fish soup filling the air, rich and comforting. 
Sunlight streamed through the small window above the sink, glinting off the wooden table where two steaming bowls sat waiting. Her mother, stood by the counter, wiping her hands on a cloth, her expression brimming with quiet pride.
Torrie adjusted her hat before pulling it off and setting it aside, the excitement still buzzing in her chest. Today was the day. The start of something new.
“Look at you, beginning your first years in Aella Academy.” Mrs. Welton smiled, lingering by the table, her eyes soft with nostalgia. &quot;Let me see you properly,&quot; she said, stepping closer.
Torrie straightened, smoothing the folds of her robe. &quot;Like this?&quot;
With a playful grin, Torrie twirled in place, the hem of her robe flaring out as she spun. She came to a stop with a little flourish, looking up at her mother expectantly. 
&quot;How do I look, Mom?&quot;
&quot;Like a grand magician,&quot; she said, reaching out to adjust a stray lock of hair from Torrie’s face. &quot;Or at least, one in the making.&quot;
Torrie sat back down.
&quot;You remind me so much of your brother,&quot; Mrs. Welton mused.
Torrie looked up, curious, “Do I?”
&quot;Not exactly, but you both are very excited. On his first day at Aella Academy,&quot; her mother continued, &quot;He was so eager, he didn’t even bother with breakfast. Just grabbed his things and took off on his bicycle straight to the harbor. Couldn’t wait to board the ferry to Osthaven.&quot;
Torrie chuckled, stirring her soup. &quot;Didn’t expect him to be that excited.&quot;
Mrs. Welton laughed, &quot;Oh, but he was,&quot; she said warmly.
&quot;Speaking of your brother…” She glanced toward the staircase.  “Where is he? Didn’t he say he’d be the one to take you himself?&quot;
Torrie shrugged. &quot;Haven’t seen him.&quot;
Mrs. Welton exhaled, rubbing her temple. &quot;Of course.&quot; She stood, pushing her chair back with a sigh.
Then she cupped her hands around her mouth and called up the stairs. &quot;Edward?!&quot;
Silence.
Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;You stay here, hon. I’ll go see if he’s still in his room.&quot;
She turned and strode toward the staircase, muttering under her breath. Torrie just smiled, spooning up a mouthful of soup as she waited.


-o-

The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by her son's room's oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 
Beyond the attic door, the room lay in comfortable chaos. The space was dim, save for the slivers of morning light through his curtains. casting long, golden beams across the floor.
Clothes strewn carelessly across the floor, some draped over the back of a chair, some half-tucked under the bed, some long forgotten. 
Books were everywhere. Its stacked haphazardly on the desk, toppled over on the nightstand, spread open on the unmade bed as if abandoned mid-thought. 
Loose parchment spilled onto the wooden floor, some pages crumpled, others torn at the edges. Half-sketched transmutation circles and scribbled formulas peeked out from beneath the clutter, most of them bore the chaotic scribbling of frustation.
Its walls bore remnants of faded posters. Some curling at the edges, one hanging on by a single pin. 
A calendar sat pinned to the wall near the door, its pages frozen in time.
The last date marked in red ink from seven years ago.
26th of April, 1920.
Near the farthest wall, a wooden desk was buried beneath the weight of research. Transmutation circles sketched and then discarded overflowed from a bin at the desk’s side. Diagrams detailing herbs, plants and mushrooms. Their alchemical properties meticulously annotated in a careful yet restless hand. 
Stacked books, their spines cracked from repeated use, bore names in gilded lettering—, Modern Alchemy by Magnus Borman, and a vintage tome The Ancient Arts of Alchemy signed only Catherine. Amid the scholarly collection sat a battered notebook filled with translations of an even older text, one written by Casnius Bolos, one of the nine sages of enlightenment. The Father of Alchemy.
And slumped over it all, was the room’s lone occupant.
His maroon diamond-patterned sweater hung loosely over his slumped shoulders, its sleeves pushed up to his elbows. His silver hair fell messily over his forehead, unkempt from restless nights. His posture was hunched, arms folded beneath his head, his breathing slow and steady in slumber.
In his ears, a pair of makeshift headphones—wired together in an unorthodox fashion—hummed faintly with a distant, crackling signal. Plugged into an even more makeshift radio, the device played something indiscernible, some half-lost frequency from far beyond Weshaven. Whether it was music or the muffled voices of a broadcast, only he could tell.
The knocking at the door continued. A soft, measured rhythm, persistent against the wood.
Still, he did not stir. Succumbing to his sleep and the sounds from distant lands.

-o-


She knocked again—more resolutely, as if the sound itself could unravel the silence that enveloped the room. 

“Eddie?” She called, yet no answer. 

Mrs. Welton sighed, “Of course, I knew it’ll come to this.”

Slipping her hand into her skirt pocket and touching her wand's smooth wooden surface. With a slight wrist movement, the wand appeared. A thin piece of dark oak with intricate interlocking ornaments. 

She pointed it at the door's lock, and a gentle click rattled the quiet attic, flickering the runes around the lock before dissolving into the shadows. She tucked her wand away and gently opened the door. 

The room was full of clutter.

Mrs. Welton’s gaze swept the room, her eyebrows lifting slightly as she took in the disarray.

 “Of course,” she muttered under her breath, stepping carefully over a crumpled tunic on the floor. “A storm couldn’t have done a better job.” 

She stared at the figure slumped on the desk, immovable except for his breathing breathing. Crackling of faint jazz music could be heard from the makeshift headset on the radio.

“Edward Welton! ” she yelled, her tone sharp but laced with exasperated fondness. 
The name cut through the attic like a thunderclap.
Eddie jolted awake so violently that his chair tipped backward. His arms flailed, his headset yanked free with a sharp crackle of static, and the makeshift radio tumbled off the desk with a clatter. 
Books, parchments, loose papers exploded into the air, cascading down like confetti in a parade of overwork. His foot caught on something—maybe a discarded tunic, maybe an open book—and he tumbled off his chair entirely, landing flat on his back with a heavy thud.
From the floor, he let out a groggy, half-incoherent groan. “Mum—what the hell?”
Mrs. Welton, unimpressed, loomed over him with her hands on her hips. &quot;You agreed weeks ago to accompany Torrie on her first day of school! I'm not letting her get lost in Osthaven while you spend all morning hibernating like some bear in a cave!&quot;
She crossed the room with purpose, the floorboards thumping beneath her feet.
Eddie sat up, rubbing his silver hair, still blinking off the remnants of sleep. “Could you at least knock first?” he grumbled.
&quot;I did knock!&quot; Mrs. Welton shot back, pointing at the unlocked door. &quot;But you were too busy listening to—” she gestured vaguely at the tangled mess of wires, the radio now buzzing with distorted, half-drowned static. “—whatever that is.”
Eddie picked up his fallen headset, giving the radio a once-over before dusting it off. &quot;It's called jazz, Mum,&quot; he said, as if that explained everything. &quot;They're pretty famous in the city, you know?&quot;
&quot;Like I care about that, Edward!&quot; Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;Now get up before Torrie is late for her first day at Aella!&quot;
Eddie groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. &quot;Aella?&quot; he muttered, his voice still thick with sleep. &quot;Torrie’s in Aella now?&quot;
Mrs. Welton pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;She is. Did you forget that too?&quot;
&quot;Look, Mum,&quot; Eddie pushed himself up, wincing as he untangled his legs from a mess of books and crumpled clothes. &quot;It’s difficult to keep track of things when Dad’s remedies need tweaking every two days.&quot; He stretched, his back popping as he tried to shake off the last bits of sleep. &quot;Can I clean up a bit before we go?&quot;
Mrs. Welton bent down with a sigh, picking up the books and papers that had scattered across the floor. Unlike Eddie, who left things in precarious heaps, she stacked them neatly, smoothing out crumpled pages before placing them back onto his desk.
&quot;You should at least try to keep things organized,&quot; she scolded, adjusting a pile of alchemy notes. &quot;Honestly, Edward, I don’t know how you can work like this.&quot;
&quot;I do work like this,&quot; Eddie shot back as he pulled a fresh shirt from a chair—though it was debatable how fresh it actually was. He gave it a quick sniff before pulling it on. &quot;I’ve been busy experimenting with potion ingredients for the apothecary. It’s not like I’m just lounging around.&quot;
&quot;Experimenting?&quot; Mrs. Welton raised a skeptical brow, lifting a parchment with a half-sketched transmutation circle and an irritated scribble of DOES NOT WORK. &quot;It looks more like you’ve been failing repeatedly.&quot;
Eddie scoffed, fumbling to button his shirt. &quot;That’s how experimentation works, Mum. Trial and error. Mostly error.&quot;
Mrs. Welton shook her head, muttering something about alchemy not excusing poor housekeeping as she continued gathering the mess. Eddie, meanwhile, laced up his boots at a painfully slow pace, buying time.
Their banter bounced back and forth, the practiced rhythm of a mother and son who had long since mastered the art of exasperating each other. Eddie mumbled complaints about unfair criticism, while Mrs. Welton countered with pointed reminders about personal responsibility.
Until—
She paused.
A single sheet of paper had slipped beneath a stack of old notes. As she reached for it, her fingers froze over the words printed neatly at the top:
Sage Institute Scholarship Referral for University Program.
Her eyes traveled lower.
At the bottom, in crisp ink—
Recipient: Edward Welton of Weshaven.
Her breath hitched.
&quot;...Edward?&quot; she said, quieter this time.
&quot;What?&quot; Eddie turned around, still adjusting the sleeve of his brown field jacket.
Mrs. Welton didn’t say anything at first. She just held up the letter.
The paper was heavier than standard parchment, its edges embroidered with intricate silver filigree. The ink, a deep, rich black, had been pressed so precisely into the page that it hadn’t faded with time. Stamped at the bottom in dark blue wax was the unmistakable insignia of the Sage Institute—one of the highest authorities on magical education.
&quot;This,&quot; Mrs. Welton said slowly, tilting the letter toward him, &quot;This is real. This is official. Care to explain what exactly it’s doing hidden under a pile of—” she gestured vaguely at the mess, “—whatever all this is?”
Eddie blinked. Then, as if a switch flipped in his mind, he let out a short chuckle. &quot;Oh, that?&quot; He rubbed the back of his head, offering an easy grin. &quot;That’s from long ago, remember? Gosh, I forgot how long ago that was. I think it’s from one of the competitions.&quot;
Mrs. Welton’s brows knitted together. &quot;Competitions?&quot;
&quot;You know,&quot; Eddie waved a hand dismissively, &quot;Alchemy Codex Decoding Tournament, potion-making contests, whatever you want to call them. I used to join a bunch back then.&quot;
&quot;You never told me you’ve got this.&quot;
Eddie hesitated for just a fraction of a second before shrugging, he was already turning back toward the door, grabbing his satchel as he moved. 
&quot;Look, it doesn’t matter now,&quot; he said, forcing an easygoing smile. &quot;I’m off with Torrie. Bye, Mum!&quot;
And before she could stop him, he slipped out the door.
Her lips pressed together, unreadable thoughts flickering behind her eyes as the floorboards creaked with Eddie’s retreating steps.
Mrs. Welton stood there for a long moment, the letter still in her hands, her eyes lingering on the name at the bottom.
Edward Welton of Weshaven.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 23 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie knelt beside Catherine, his fingers trembling as he shook her shoulders again. No response. She remained limp, her breathing shallow.
His stomach twisted. Damn it. She isn’t waking up.
And then… A shadow loomed over him.
Eddie’s breath stopped as he looked up.
The Nightingale Dragon made its way through the smoke, its monstrous form wreathed in fire. Its obsidian-black scales glistened like molten glass, reflecting the flickering embers that floated through the air. And then, through the shifting haze, Eddie saw them—
Five glowing red eyes. His pulse pounded in his ears. He had shot one of those eyes. Destroyed it. But now…
The ruined eye twitched.
A sickening squelch could be heard in the middle of the hearth.
The shattered socket bulged, raw flesh writhing like something alive. The jagged ball of lead he had fired into it slid loose, falling to the ground with a hollow clink, discarded like a worthless pebble. Echoing through the ruins.
Before his very eyes, a new eye pushed its way into place—larger, grotesque, its veins pulsing with a deep, hellish red glow.
Eddie’s breath caught..
This thing… it regenerates.
A cold, primal fear sank its claws into his chest.
His gaze darted to his surroundings—his rifle lay in splinters, shattered beyond repair. Catherine’s staff was broken, its elegant wood snapped in two.
They had nothing.
His fingers curled into fists.
His thumb brushed over the smooth surface of his jade ring.
His heart slowed as he realised one thing… He was never unarmed.
Eddie closed his eyes. Took a breath.
I was an Alchemist, he thought.
Then, he stood… The dragon’s eyes narrowed.
No… He straightened his back, shoulders squaring.
I am an Alchemist… I always was.
His jade ring began to glow.
From his outstretched hand, a luminous transmutation circle flared to life. Radiant, intricate, lines of emerald light spiraling outward.
The dragon growled—a deep, guttural sound like stone grinding against stone.
Eddie met its gaze.
His hands clenched around the metal and powder.
He stepped forward.

-o-

The Nightingale Dragon loomed, its jagged silhouette framed by the flickering glow of distant fires. Its five glowing eyes followed Eddie’s every movement, but it did not strike. It was waiting.
Eddie stepped forward.
The dragon did not move.
He took another step.
Then another.
His walk quickened.
The dragon’s massive chest expanded, its ribcage stretching outward, a deep, hollow rumble growing from within.
Frost began to creep across its obsidian-black scales, and the air turned bitterly cold.
It’s inhaling.
Eddie’s jog turned into a sprint.
The dragon’s throat glowed pale blue, veins of freezing energy pulsing beneath its skin.
Eddie gritted his teeth.
The dragon reared its head back.
Eddie charged forward.
The dragon roared.
Then—
A howling burst of frost exploded from the creature’s maw.
A blizzard of pure ice erupted into the ruins, freezing the stone in an instant. The ground cracked and shattered under the pressure of sudden frost, jagged spires of ice erupting from every surface.
Eddie hit the ground hard, his shoulder slamming into the frozen earth as he rolled behind a crumbling archway. Ice crackled and groaned around him, jagged spires erupting where he had stood only moments before.
His breath came in ragged gasps, each inhale sharp and burning in the freezing air. The courtyard—once a shattered ruin of ancient stone—had transformed into a glacial tomb. The dragon’s breath had turned the ruins into a maze of glittering ice, cold and unyielding.
Eddie’s heart pounded against his ribs, his pulse drumming in his ears. He turned, searching for an opening, a weakness—anything—but every exit had been sealed beneath thick walls of ice. The stone pathways leading out were gone, buried beneath translucent barricades that caught the moonlight like stained glass.
His fingers curled into fists. No, no, no—he couldn’t be stuck here.
Eddie pressed himself against the frozen wall, his breath misting in front of him. Think. He had to think. Alchemy. Transmutation. Anything. But his fingers were stiff, the cold digging into his bones, numbing him from the inside out. He could feel frost clinging to his skin, biting deep through his clothes.
He was running out of time.
The dragon let out a low, guttural growl, the vibrations rattling through the ice. Its five glowing eyes narrowed, its breath misting in the frigid air. It knew he was trapped. It was toying with him.
A tight knot of panic curled in Eddie’s stomach. He couldn’t die here. Not in this place. Not like this.
Move. Find a way.
His eyes darted across the courtyard, searching. He had one chance—just one. If he could manipulate the ice, destabilize it, break through—
The dragon inhaled again.
The air around Eddie dropped to a deathly chill.
No time.
He had to act. Now.
His hands moved frantically over his jacket, his satchels—there had to be something. Something he could use. The ice was useless to him, too frozen to manipulate without the right reagents.
His fingers brushed against the rough fabric of a pouch strapped to his belt. Bingo.
Gunpowder. Lead balls. Ignition powder. Metal. Fire.
Fireballs.
A flicker of hope cut through the crushing fear. His mind raced, pulling together the pieces. The transmutation circle—how it needed to be structured, the conversion of energy, the propulsion—
Yes. He could make this work.
But first—an opening.
Eddie exhaled slowly, forcing his breathing under control. He kept his body low, his movements precise. Every crunch of ice beneath his boots was a risk. He had to keep moving, stay out of the dragon’s direct line of sight.
Above him, the Nightingale Dragon shifted. Its long neck curved slightly, its five glowing eyes scanning the frozen courtyard. It was searching for him. Hunting.
Eddie pressed himself against the jagged wall of ice, fingers tightening around the pouch at his belt. He had one shot at this. If the dragon saw him before he was ready—he was dead.
His pulse hammered as he inched forward, step by careful step, avoiding the shimmering patches where the ice was thin and fragile. One wrong move, and the crunch of breaking frost would give him away.
He clenched his jaw. He could do this.
Just a little closer…
Just a little more…
The dragon’s breath subsided, leaving behind a ruin of jagged ice and frost. The air shimmered with the aftershock of unnatural cold. Crystals of frozen mist settled onto the ruined stone, turning the battlefield into a frozen wasteland.
The Nightingale Dragon lowered its head, its long neck curving as its five eyes gleamed in the dim light. It sniffed, the deep sound reverberating through the silent ruins.
It had trapped its prey. There was no escape… There should be no escape.
Its claws scraped against the ice as it leaned in, peering into the crystalline prison it had forged. The fractured ice reflected its own jagged silhouette back at it, but something was missing…
It narrowed its eyes. No movement. No heartbeat. No breath.
The dragon exhaled, a low growl rumbling deep in its throat. 
Then, a flicker—something faint.
Its gaze snapped to a section of the ice. 
A hole. Small but unmistakable. And melting.
The realization dawned too late.
It whipped its head around, scanning the ruins. Its tail lashed behind it, sending a sharp gust of freezing wind through the air. 
And then—
It saw him.
The boy.
Standing there, beyond the shattered remnants of a falling archway, his gaze locked with the dragon’s.
There was a glow in the boy’s hand. The light was sharp. Focused. Dangerous.
A circle. Floating. Pulsing with arcane symbols, burning bright like molten gold.
And in its center—a sphere of metal. Encased in fire.
It fired.
The fireball shot through the air like a comet, striking the Nightingale Dragon’s head dead-on. A surge of satisfaction surged through Eddie’s chest as he saw the impact. The flames licked across the creature’s obsidian scales, searing a bright red mark into its thinner plating near the temple.
Then… nothing.
The dragon didn’t fall. It didn’t stagger. It didn’t even recoil.
Instead, its five eyes burned with a new fury.
The smoldering mark he had left was shallow, insignificant. A dent, no more. The beast was not wounded. It was enraged.
The dragon moved.
A blur of black and blue.
Before Eddie could react, a shadow loomed over him—a massive tail, jagged with ice and spines, whipping through the air with deadly speed.
Impact.
Eddie barely had time to brace before the force hit him like a cannonball.
Pain exploded across his ribs as his body was hurled backward, air ripping from his lungs. He saw the world spin—jagged ruins, a glimpse of sky, a blur of movement—before he crashed straight into an ancient archway.
The stone crumbled upon impact.
Dust and ice filled his vision as the world tipped sideways. His back screamed in protest, his limbs numb from the sheer force. His body lay sprawled amidst the shattered debris, pain crackling through every nerve like wildfire.
His ears rang.
His vision swam.
Was this it?
He tried to move, but his arms felt like lead. A faint coppery taste filled his mouth.
The heavy sound of approaching footsteps rumbled through the frozen ground.
The dragon was coming.
The rubble beneath Eddie felt cold. Unforgiving. Sharp edges of broken stone dug into his palms as he tried to shift, but his body refused to obey. His ribs ached, his head spun, and each breath came shallow and ragged.
The Nightingale Dragon inched closer.
Its five glowing eyes bore into him, its jagged maw parting with slow, deliberate hunger. Each breath it took sent a deep, guttural vibration through the frozen air, a terrible hum that rattled in Eddie’s bones.
Was this it?
Was this really how he was going to die?
His fingers curled into a fist, weak, trembling… It wasn’t supposed to end like this.
He had fought so hard, come so far—only to fail. Only to be powerless.
His mind drifted.
Back to his childhood.
Back to the dream he once had.
To be an Alchemist. To create. To discover. To prove himself.
Once, that dream had been everything.
And yet, over the years, he had let it fade. He had let it be swallowed by doubt, by failure, by the weight of expectations that he could never meet.
And now?
Now, he would die here—without ever realizing what he truly wanted.
The dragon drew in a breath.
Its chest glowed an eerie, pale blue, veins of ice pulsing beneath its obsidian scales.
It was preparing its breath again.
Eddie shut his eyes.
Then—
A crack of heat.
A sudden, explosive roar cut through the frozen air.
Eddie’s eyes snapped open just in time to see fire—a brilliant, searing torrent of flame—slam into the dragon’s side.
But this wasn’t his fire.
This one was stronger. More powerful.
It burned through the dragon’s thick scales, piercing deep, forcing the beast to stagger back with a pained, guttural screech.
Eddie turned, dazed.
And then—he saw her.
Catherine.
She stood at a distance, supported by her staff—the very same staff that had been broken in two not long ago.
But now, it was whole. Mended.
Her robes were torn, her face bruised, her breath uneven—but her stance was firm.
A storm brewed in her golden eyes.
“Damn fool,” Catherine spat, voice sharp with frustration.
She took a step forward, gripping her staff tighter.
“You should’ve stayed with the others, Edward.”</Text>
            <Notes>Eddie will lose


1. Eddie stood there

2. The dragon fired shot

3. Eddie was trapped, taking cover in a ruined courtyard, the dragon continually fired its icy breath, bringing everything into jagged ice

4. Eddie then remembers, the gunpowders, lead balls, ignition, metal, fire… Fireballs

He then began thinking of the Transmutation Circle, how it all came to be, who hard it will propell forward… He got it!He just needed an opening, he continually moving, obviously trying to make as little noise as possible, whilst avoiding the dragon’s gaze

As the dragon finishes his icy breath, it looked around, it sniffed, it seemed to try finding Eddie

And then, an opening, the Dragon’s eyes met Eddie, and Eddie met its eyes, but there is something elseOn Eddie’s hand is a circular holographic transmutation circle and on top of it, a small metal ball, fire encapsulating it, the fire glows brightly

And then it shots

5. Eddie hits the dragon, the fireball hits the dragon’s chest where the scales were a lot more thinner, it made a little indent, but not penetrating it

6. The dragon retalliates, he couldn’t escape, and was hit 

7. Is this how he die? Eddie thought, 

8. But before the dragon could unleash his cold breath, Catherine emerges from the place where she lie, she had regained her conciousness, she had mended her staff, and she is shooting fireball

“Damn fool,” She spat, “Should’ve stayed with the others.”

            <Title>Chapter 1.5E</Title>
            <Text>The scratchy wool of the infirmary-issued blanket was doing little to soothe the restless energy thrumming through Eddie Welton. He lay propped against the headboard of his dorm bed, a prisoner in his own room. His left ankle, a throbbing, swollen lump beneath a fresh bandage, was a constant, unwelcome reminder of the creature—all teeth and shadows—that had darted out from the alley behind the Alchemist's Brew cafe. A single  metal crutch leaned against his bedside cabinet, both a lifeline and a symbol of his confinement.
Across the room, Will was methodically checking the contents of his leather satchel. Textbooks, a roll of parchment, a case of glass vials that clinked softly. He was everything Eddie wasn't at the moment: composed, mobile, and annoyingly sensible.
“Alright, I’ve told Professor Rheagan you came down with a nasty fall from the common room stairs,” Will said, He zipped his bag shut and picked up his wand from his desk—a slender rod of polished oak. “She sends her sympathies and expects you to be bedridden for at least two days. I’ll get notes from her practical alchemy lecture for you.” He turned, his gaze firm. “On the condition that you actually stay bedridden. No sneaking out, Eddie.”
Eddie shifted, pushing himself up straighter against the headboard with a defiant wince. &quot;What are you? My dad? Not even my dad is as strict as you!&quot;
Will pinched the bridge of his nose, a familiar gesture of exasperation. “I’m not opposed to your usual brand of mayhem, Eddie, I know you want to go outside. But the Student Council gave us an official warning two weeks ago. One more warning, and they report us to the Faculty. You’ll be finished.”
&quot;But...&quot; Eddie said, tilting his head with a sly smirk that didn't quite hide the pain in his ankle. &quot;What if they don't find out?&quot;
&quot;That doesn't matter, because I'm worried if they do find out!&quot; Will countered, his voice rising with frustration. &quot;Do you want to get expelled in your first year? Is that the goal?&quot;
&quot;No...&quot; Eddie mumbled, looking away towards the window. &quot;But I don't want to be bored, either.&quot;
“Honestly, Will.” A light, musical voice cut in from the doorway. “Where could he possibly go?” Ashley leaned against the doorframe, “His ankle’s busted. He can’t exactly outrun a campus patrol, can he?”
Will sighed, running a hand through his already tidy hair. “You’re forgetting who we’re talking about, Ash. This is Eddie.” He gestured vaguely towards the bed. “Trouble finds him because he goes out looking for it with a map and a packed lunch. My class is across campus, and yours isn’t until this evening. I’m officially deputizing you to keep an eye on him because….”
As they spoke, Eddie tuned out the familiar back-and-forth. His world had narrowed to a single objective. His fingers twitched, inching over the rough texture of the blanket. His eyes darted from the crutch—just within reach if he stretched—to the open window, where a cool afternoon breeze rustled the ivy clinging to the old stone walls of the dormitory. Freedom.
“...it’s not just about his ankle.” Will continued, “The Student Council is already looking for an excuse to put him on probation after that incident in the lower labs. If he’s caught wandering around campus when he’s officially on medical leave, they’ll have his head. He needs to lay low, properly.”
Ashley listened, her expression shifting from amusement to a flicker of understanding. She opened her mouth to reply, but then her eyes drifted towards the bed behind Will. The grin returned, wider this time.
“...aaaaaand he’s gone,” she said lightly.
“What?” Will spun around.
The bed was empty. The blanket was thrown aside in a heap, and the crutch was gone. Will’s eyes widened in disbelief before he rushed back into the room, his carefully maintained composure shattering. He scanned the empty space, then his gaze shot to the open window. He leaned out, his face a mask of horrified frustration.
Down below, Eddie was standing on the decorative brickwork that lined the building. Under his focused will, the bricks were behaving like a slow, silent elevator, lowering him gently from the second-story window to the grassy quad below. The moment his feet—one good, one useless—touched the ground, the bricks seamlessly settled back into the wall as if nothing had happened.
“Edward!” Will bellowed, his voice echoing across the quad and earning a few curious glances from passing students. “Get yourself back in here, right now!”
Eddie, now upright with the help of his crutch, didn't break his stride. He shouted back over his shoulder, his voice full of unwavering determination, “I’ll be back before curfew! Don’t you worry!”
Will watched him hobble away towards the main campus path, a tiny, defiant figure on a mission. He gripped the windowsill, his knuckles white with annoyance.
From behind him, Ashley’s voice was laced with wry satisfaction.
“Told ya you can’t stop him.”

-o-

The university grounds were a familiar sea of activity. Streams of students flowed along the stone pathways, their satchels slung over their shoulders and their conversations a low hum that filled the crisp morning air. For them, it was just another day of lectures and library sessions. For Eddie, it was a covert operation.
He kept his head down, the rhythmic thump-click… thump-click of his crutch on the flagstones a stark contrast to the hurried footsteps of everyone around him. Technically, he wasn't skipping class. He was on sanctioned medical leave, a fact that gave him a sliver of confidence. Still, every glimpse of a campus patrol uniform made him tense up.
With his free hand, he reached into the lower-left pocket of his brown jacket. His fingers closed around a worn, folded piece of paper. He pulled it out, glancing down at the familiar, neat handwriting.
Madeleine D. 
0712 443 229 21st 
Norwood Street. Past the Campground. 
Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.
He folded the paper carefully and slipped it back into his pocket. She said she has something to show me. The memory of their last conversation, a brief, hurried exchange after the incident, was the entire reason he was currently risking expulsion. He looked around, his determination warring with a sudden wave of anxiety. Should he just show up? Or would it be better to call first? The latter seemed less likely to get him chased off the property by a territorial hippogriff.
He spotted one of the university's old, dark-wood phone booths near the edge of the main quad. It looked like a relic from another era, but it was functional. He hobbled over, squeezed inside, and pulled the heavy door shut, muffling the campus noise to a distant murmur.
Taking a deep breath, he fished the paper back out and carefully dialed the number. The rotary clicks sounded unnaturally loud in the small space. He waited, his heart thumping against his ribs with each ring. He was so nervous he could feel his palms sweating.
&quot;Hello?&quot; A warm, clear voice came from the other end.
His heart lurched into his throat. He swallowed hard, trying to sound casual. &quot;O-oh, hey... it's ummm... Edward... Eddie...&quot; he stammered, hating how shaky he sounded.
A moment of silence, then recognition dawned in her voice. &quot;Oh, Edward!&quot; Madeleine said, her tone instantly friendly. &quot;How are you? I heard what happened. I thought you were supposed to be resting today?&quot;
&quot;Well um, about that,&quot; Eddie chuckled, a nervous tremor in his laugh. &quot;I got better.&quot; It wasn't a complete lie; he was, at least, vertical. &quot;Oh and,&quot; he continued, rushing the words out before he lost his nerve, &quot;last week you said you got something to show me at your sanctuary. Can I... go there? To check it out?&quot;
&quot;Oh, you want to go today?&quot; Madeleine sounded pleased. &quot;Yeah, sure! I'll be on shift until 5, I can give you a tour. The sanctuary is pretty hidden, so just board the E7 route bus. When you arrive at the final stop, just follow the path near the campgrounds and go past the griffin statue. You can't miss it.&quot;
&quot;Oh, okay!&quot; Eddie said, a wave of relief washing over him. &quot;Um, see you then!&quot;
He slammed the phone back into its cradle with a loud clatter and leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the booth door, breathing a deep sigh of relief. The hardest part, he hoped, was over. Now, he just had to get there.
The university bus stop was an organized chaos of students coming and going. Eddie navigated the throng, his focus narrowed to a single, repetitive mantra murmured under his breath.
“E7 route… Norwood… past griffin statue…”
The words were a lifeline, a tangible goal that kept him moving forward despite the throbbing protest from his ankle. Each step was a carefully managed negotiation between pain and determination. He kept his head down, hoping to blend into the sea of faces, to be just another student heading off campus.
“Hey, Eddie! What do you think you’re doing?!”
The voice cut through the noise, sharp and sickeningly familiar. Eddie’s head snapped up. About twenty yards away, standing near the entrance to the station, were Will and Ashley. Will looked furious, his satchel clutched in a white-knuckled grip. Ashley, beside him, had an expression that was half concern, half morbid curiosity.
Crap.
There was no time for an explanation, no room for another argument. He had to move. Now.
Ignoring the sharp complaint from his ankle, Eddie quickened his pace. It was a clumsy, lurching hobble, a far cry from his usual speed, but it was the best he could manage. He pushed off harder with his crutch, weaving through students who shot him annoyed looks.
“Eddie, get back here!” Will’s voice was closer now.
The chase was on. Will, uninjured and driven by sheer panic, tried to bull his way through the dense crowd. “Excuse me… sorry… let me through!” He was a swimmer fighting against a powerful current, his progress frustratingly slow as students, plugged into their own worlds with headphones and conversations, blocked his path.
Eddie, meanwhile, was using his injury almost as an advantage, his crutch and visible limp parting the crowd with a mix of sympathy and annoyance. 
Will is closing the distance, he could feel the frantic energy of the pursuit at his back. His lungs burned. His ankle screamed with every jarring step. Just a little further.
Then he saw it. Pulling up to the designated stop with a hydraulic hiss was a large, blue-and-white bus. Emblazoned on its digital sign were the two characters he was praying for: E7.
A surge of hope, pure and potent, flooded through him. It was the adrenaline shot he needed. He abandoned any attempt to manage the pain and launched himself forward in a desperate, final sprint.
The bus doors swung open.
“Eddie!” Will bellowed, finally breaking through the last line of students. He was only an arm's length away now, his fingers outstretched, lunging for the sleeve of Eddie’s brown jacket.
But he was a second too late.
Eddie’s foot landed on the first step of the bus. He hauled himself aboard, nearly tripping, and scrambled away from the door just as Will’s hand swiped through empty air. The doors hissed shut, sealing Eddie inside. He pressed his face against the cool glass, making brief, triumphant eye contact with his furious best friend before the bus rumbled to life and pulled away from the curb, carrying him towards Norwood.
Will stood on the pavement, chest heaving, watching the E7 bus disappear into the Edenfield traffic. He slowly lowered his hand, the frantic energy draining out of him, replaced by a cold, heavy dread. Ashley came to a stop beside him, hands tucked in her pockets.
“We’re so finished, Ash,” Will said hopelessly, staring at the spot where the bus had been.
“Hey, I mean,” Ashley said, giving him a light, playful elbow in the ribs, “a trip down to the Faculty office wouldn’t hurt, right? Think of it as a new experience.”
Will turned to look at her, his expression grim. “You’re not helping.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 26 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie drifted awake.
At first, there was warmth—the kind that seeped into his bones, heavy and lulling. Then came the weight pressing down on him, the dull ache that pulsed with each breath, tethering him back to reality.
Light filtered through stained-glass panels above, casting fragmented hues of crimson, sapphire, and emerald across the ceiling. The colors shifted as the breeze stirred the silken curtains surrounding the beds, sending ripples of light across the room. He blinked against it, his vision hazy, the shapes around him swimming into focus.
The ward was vast and open, lined with pristine white beds, each separated by shimmering silk drapes that glowed faintly in the shifting light. The air was thick with the scent of herbs and incense, laced with an eerie sort of quiet, still and controlled. Faint murmurs wove through the silence, rhythmic incantations carried on soft voices. The hum of magic pulsed in the air, subtle yet undeniable.
Healers moved gracefully between the beds, their robes flowing like water with each step. Their hands glowed as they worked, weaving healing spells with careful precision. Eddie watched them through half-lidded eyes, the sight stirring an unease deep in his chest.
He tried to move. A sharp pull in his side stopped him. A hiss of pain escaped through clenched teeth. He dragged his gaze downward, finding his chest bound in fresh white bandages. The faint scent of salves clung to them—earthy, sharp, and strangely familiar. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose, soft robe.
Memories surfaced sluggishly.
The Deep Glaive. Catherine. The Nightingale Dragon.
The fight. The cold bite of exhaustion. The weightlessness of his body giving in.
He had blacked out.
His breath wavered slightly.
Eddie turned his head, taking in his surroundings.
Beside his bed, a small wooden table held a single cupcake, its frosting slightly smudged. Next to it, a familiar little box rested, its lid ajar. His chest tightened, recognition settling in before his mind had fully caught up.
Two envelopes lay beside the cupcake, each scrawled in distinct, familiar handwriting.
For the first time since waking, something other than the heaviness in his limbs stirred inside him.
He reached for the box first, lifting it open. Inside was his jade ring, the heavy silver bands coarse against his fingertips. Another note was tucked beneath it, the handwriting unmistakably his sister Torrie’s. He unfolded it and started reading: 

“Hey, figured you might want your antique ring back! Don’t worry, though—Dad said he’s buying a better one for me. ;) Take care of yourself, Eddie. Mom, Dad, Markus, and everyone at the Apothecary send their love.” 

Eddie couldn’t help but chuckle. The familiar warmth of Torrie’s humour worked its way through his lingering exhaustion. 

He turned the ring over in his hands. It was once an extension of himself, a part of who he was before... before everything changed. There was still a reluctance within him. He was hesitant about picking it back up, about returning to the world of Alchemy. But here it was, given back to him with a laugh as if it were no more than an old toy. 

Setting the note aside, Eddie reached for the second letter. The paper was thicker. The handwriting was unmistakably his mother’s—precise, sharp, and severe. His stomach knotted as he unfolded it, already sensing the anger etched into every line. 

Eddie,
I hope you’re reading this with both eyes open and your head still attached, because I have a lot to say. First of all—what in the world were you thinking?
Catherine told me she was taking you, Torrie, and Markus to see the old ruins. THE RUINS. She did not mention anything about a dangerous, unpredictable Illusory Forest! I trusted her to keep you all safe, and instead, you come back bruised, battered, and unconscious in a hospital bed. Do you have any idea what that put me through? Do you have any idea how close I was to marching down there myself?
And as for Catherine—oh, she is getting an earful when she returns. You can be sure of that.
That being said... I’m relieved. More than I can put into words. You and Catherine may be worse for wear, but you’re alive. You’re safe. That’s what matters most. Even if you scared ten years off my life.
—Mom
P.S. Your father is devastated about the rifle. He’s been muttering about it for hours. Do you know how long he’s had that thing? If you were hoping for a dramatic, heartfelt fatherly lecture, well—tough luck. He’s too busy mourning his ‘poor, faithful companion’ to be mad at you.
Eddie exhaled through his nose, amused and guilty. His mother’s words stung, but not in an unfair way—he really hadn’t thought he’d get into this much trouble when he agreed to follow Catherine. But he did. And yet…
He ran a hand through his hair, sinking back into the pillows. Even with the bruises, the exhaustion, and the scolding he’d surely get once he was home, a part of him couldn’t deny it—he’d had more thrill, more excitement, more life in those few days than he had in years.
A quiet chuckle escaped him.
Then a thought stirred. A vague, nagging feeling that he was forgetting something.
Wasn’t there something important happening at the end of December?
He frowned, trying to sift through his sluggish memory, but nothing surfaced. His mind felt like a fogged-up window, the answer just out of reach.
His eyes drifted to the calendar hanging on the wall opposite him.
3rd of January, 1928.
Huh.
How had he lost track of time? It felt like he had only been out for a few hours, maybe a day. But a whole new year had begun without him.
A strange unease settled in his chest, but before he could dwell on it, his gaze landed on the last unopened letter on his bedside.
Right. There was one more.
Eddie turned the letter over in his hands, frowning. It wasn’t like the others. The paper was stiff, slightly worn at the edges, as if it had been folded and unfolded too many times.
Then he saw the writing on the envelope.
Sage Institute Scholarship Referral for University Program.
His breath caught.
Below it, written in the neat, official script of an academy scribe:
Recipient: Edward Welton of Weshaven.
And at the bottom, the final line—the one that made his stomach drop:
Referral valid until the 29th of December, 1927.
His heart sank. The scholarship he had once fought so hard for—the one that had been his golden ticket to a future in Alchemy, the one that had been shoved in his pocket, ignored, carried with him all this time—was finally, officially expired.
A hollow silence filled his chest.
It’s over.
The weight of the letter in his hands felt different now, heavier yet hollow. He had carried it for so long, stuffed it in his jacket pocket, ignored it whenever someone asked. Why don’t you go to university, Edward? Why not Alchemy, Edward? What happened to you, Edward?
And now, finally—finally—he was free of it. No more questions. No more expectations. His mother wouldn’t bring it up over dinner, Torrie wouldn’t make her teasing remarks, Markus wouldn’t give him that disappointed look.
It was over. He was free.
So why did it feel like he had just lost something?
A strange emptiness stretched inside him—like stepping out of a cage only to realize he had nowhere to go.
Only back to his family’s Apothecary.
Back to the brewing room.
Making potions.
His fingers slackened. The letter slipped from his grasp and landed soundlessly on the blanket. His arm dropped back onto the bed, too heavy to lift again.
He tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling. The late morning light shimmered through the stained-glass windows, casting fractured patterns across the walls. He watched them flicker and shift, his mind blank.
Then, out of nowhere, a sting pricked at his eyes. A tightness swelled in his throat.
He sniffed.
Once… and then Twice…
His nose was running. A flu? Did he just get a cold?
He raised a hand to wipe at his face, only to realize his fingers were damp.
Before he knew it, his vision blurred. His shoulders trembled.
Eddie frowned, wiping them away quickly, but they kept coming and coming. Silent and stubborn. He swiped at his nose, frustrated, confused.
Why?
Why was he crying?
He didn’t care about the damn letter.
He didn’t care about the damn university scholarship.
He didn’t.
But his body betrayed him. His chest ached. His breath came in shallow, uneven gasps as the tears refused to stop.
He clenched his jaw, pressing his palms against his eyes as if that would stop them. But his emotions protested, breaking past his defenses, spilling over in quiet, shuddering breaths.
And for the first time in a long while, Eddie let himself feel it.

-o-

Eddie carefully swung his legs over the edge of the bed, testing his strength as his feet touched the cool floor. His chest ached under the bandages. Every movement sent a throb of discomfort through his body. The letter lay tucked back into his jacket, hidden away once more. He didn’t want to look at it. 
His stomach grumbled. Right—he hadn’t eaten since… when? He exhaled, rubbing his eyes before pushing himself up. His limbs felt sluggish, weighed down by exhaustion, but hunger gnawed at him enough to force him forward.
He stood slowly, wobbling slightly as his body adjusted to the weight of his injuries. His hands instinctively reached for the bedside table for balance. His body protested, but he ignored it, moving past the silk curtains and into the open ward.
The space was still and bright, golden light filtering through the stained glass. Healers drifted between beds, their robes trailing soundlessly behind them. Soft murmurs of magic wove through the air, mixing with the faint scent of herbal salves.
He hadn’t made it far before a voice called out.
“I’m sorry, but you shouldn’t be up yet, Mr. Welton.”
Eddie turned.
A healer stood nearby, watching him with a raised brow. She was a tall, willowy woman with auburn hair pinned in a loose bun. The glow of healing magic still shimmered faintly around her hands.
Noticing his face, the healer asked, “Are you alright?”
“I— um,” He straightened, attempting a polite smile. “Yeah, I’m alright. Just got a bit of a cold.”
Her skeptical gaze flickered over him, lingering on the paleness of his face, the sluggish way he held himself.
“A cold, hm?” she said dryly. “Well, your ribs might disagree.”
Eddie huffed a quiet chuckle. “Fair point.” He cleared his throat. “I was just wondering… is there anywhere I could get coffee around here?”
The healer sighed but didn’t argue. Instead, she gestured toward the hallway leading to the courtyard. “The hospital café is just around the corner, near the garden.” Then, with a knowing look, she added, “But take it slow. You’re still healing.”
He gave her a small, grateful nod. “Thanks.”
She shook her head, muttering something about reckless patients, before turning back to her work.
Eddie exhaled and made his way toward the courtyard.

            <Text>The familiar bustle of Edenfield University felt hollow to Will as he navigated its pathways. Gone was his usual easy smile, replaced by a grim determination etched on his face. In his right hand, a wad of flyers emblazoned with the chilling words &quot;Missing Person&quot; served as a constant reminder of their plight. Ashley's smiling face, captured in the accompanying photo, only amplified the weight that settled on his heart with each step.
Will wasn't alone in his mission. Madeleine, her presence a silent pillar of support, walked beside him. The once vibrant campus, teeming with student life, now seemed muted, the usual chatter replaced by hushed whispers that followed them like worried shadows. Every curious glance that lingered on their grim expressions fueled Will's urgency.
With each poster he slapped onto a surface - a telephone pole, a wall, a bulletin board - a flicker of hope ignited, only to be extinguished by the harsh reality of the situation. His hands trembled slightly as he secured another one, the stark contrast between Ashley's beaming smile and the stark words above it a constant punch to the gut.
Madeleine's voice, a beacon of unwavering belief, pierced through the fog of despair clouding his mind. &quot;Will,&quot; she said, her hand finding his, &quot;we're going to find her. I can feel it.&quot;
Will yearned to share her optimism. &quot;I wish I could too, Madeleine,&quot; he sighed, his voice heavy with a weariness that belied the short time since Ashley's disappearance. &quot;But it's been almost a day, and the police have nothing. I feel... powerless.&quot;
&quot;I understand,&quot; Madeleine offered gently, her grip tightening on his hand. &quot;But giving up hope isn't an option. Ashley wouldn't want that.&quot;
Will squeezed her hand back, a flicker of defiance igniting within him. &quot;You're right,&quot; he conceded, straightening his shoulders as they continued their walk. &quot;Ashley wouldn't want to be kidnapped in the first place,&quot; he muttered, his voice laced with anger.
Their journey continued, a silent promise hanging heavy in the air. They would plaster Ashley's face on every surface, their determination a testament to their unwavering friendship. As they moved from building to building, Will's mind churned with the unanswered questions that gnawed at him like a relentless predator. But amidst the fear and desperation, a spark of hope remained alive, fueled by Madeleine's unwavering belief and their shared love for their missing friend. They would find Ashley. They had to.
-o-
Will and Madeleine sank onto a weathered bench outside the library, their postering marathon taking its toll. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, painting the campus in a warm, melancholic glow. A cool breeze rustled through the nearby trees, carrying the faint scent of freshly cut grass and offering a momentary respite from the emotional turmoil churning within them. Each clutched a condensation-slicked beverage, the chilled liquid a small comfort against the burning worry in their hearts.
Will stared down at his drink, his brow furrowed in a mixture of self-reproach and despair. &quot;I should have known, Madeleine,&quot; he muttered, his voice heavy with regret. &quot;My own bandmates... part of the Black Hand. How could I have been so blind?&quot;
Madeleine reached out, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. &quot;It's not your fault, Will,&quot; she said softly. &quot;They were good at hiding their true nature. No one could have expected this.&quot;
Will shook his head, unconvinced. &quot;But I should have seen it. We were a band for a year, for crying out loud! There were signs, little things that just didn't sit right. I ignored them. And now Ashley...&quot; He choked back a sob, the word &quot;gone&quot; hanging heavy in the air.
Squeezing his shoulder gently, Madeleine offered words of comfort. &quot;Will, listen to me,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;You can't blame yourself for this. You're not a mind reader. No one expects you to see through people's lies, especially when they're so deeply woven.&quot;
A heavy silence descended upon them, broken only by the distant sounds of students hurrying to their evening classes. Finally, after a long moment, Madeleine spoke again, her voice softer now, laced with a hint of curiosity.
&quot;You cared about her a lot, didn't you, Will?&quot; she asked, a knowing smile playing on her lips.
Will met her gaze, a flicker of surprise crossing his features. He hesitated for a moment, then a small, genuine smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he admitted sheepishly. &quot;More than I ever admitted, even to myself.&quot;
His smile broadened, tinged with a bittersweet fondness. &quot;She could be a real pain in the neck in class, I'll give her that,&quot; he chuckled, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek. &quot;But you know what? She was special. Like a… a firecracker, always bursting with energy and life. And yeah,&quot; he continued, his voice firm now, a newfound determination replacing the self-pity, &quot;she's my best friend.”
Madeleine returned his smile, her own eyes shining with fierce determination. “Then we will find her.” 




As Will and Madeleine sat onto a bench outside the library, the weight of their shared sorrow momentarily lifted by the simple act of companionship
”Eddie!” A voice shouted from the distant lawn, “Will!” another follows, the voice is distant.Eddie and Will was taken from their reverie to find the source of the voice, it was then they see the silhouette of a billowing black cloak and a brunette hair with blond tips, from the distance, her silhouette is so small as she ran. She looked so small from across the lawn,
As she closes the distance Ashley's footsteps echo against the pavement as she gets closer between them.
Reaching them, Ashley stopped, her chest heaving with exertion. Her clothes were rumpled, her black jacket hanging askew on her shoulder, a testament to his frantic dash across campus. &quot;Ed, Will,&quot; she gasped, his voice thick with breathless anticipation. &quot;Meeting at the library tonight.&quot;“Victoria…” Ashley gasped, “She had found a lead into Madeleine’s kidnapping.” </Text>

            <Text>The Edenfield Library always smelled like dust, old ink, and rain—even when it hadn’t rained in days. Eddie Welton sat cross-legged on the cold marble floor beneath the arched reading lamps, eyes fixed on the door. The shadows of the towering bookshelves stretched long across the carpet as midnight edged closer.
The silence wasn’t peaceful. It was the kind that settled in the chest, heavy and waiting.
Will paced in front of the fireplace, boots tapping softly against the flagstone. His guitar case leaned against the wall, unopened. For once, he wasn’t humming.
“This is ridiculous,” Will muttered. “You know that, right?”
Eddie didn’t answer. His fingers were laced together, knuckles pale.
Will stopped pacing. “We’re talking about breaking into a hideout full of people who merge humans with animals. That’s not a prank. That’s not another dumb Book Pirate scheme. That’s—” he gestured wildly “—psychotic, Ed.”
Eddie looked up. “They have Madeleine.”
That shut Will up for a moment.
Across the room, behind the reception desk, Claire was curled up in the librarian’s swivel chair. She looked like she hadn’t slept in days. Her cardigan was rumpled, and her hands trembled slightly as she clutched a mug of something that had long gone cold. Her eyes were distant, somewhere far from the lamplight.
“I’m telling you,” she said quietly, barely above a whisper. “We went to the district. The one by the Arkwright tunnel. There was an entrance hidden beneath an abandoned bakery. We thought it was just a rumor, but there were guards. Real guards. Runes on the door. Madeleine… she told me to run. Said she’d distract them. I didn't want to leave her.”
Eddie stood slowly, walking to the desk. He crouched beside Claire. “You said you went to the police.”
She nodded. “Three different times. The Watchmen wrote it off as hallucinations—said maybe I’d been hexed or breathing in fumes from some old alchemy shop. One even laughed.”
Will gave a low whistle. “And people wonder why students take things into their own hands.”
Claire’s hands tightened around the mug. “We’ve got to do something about this.”
Eddie nodded, firm now. “And we will.”
Will exhaled hard and flopped into one of the reading chairs. “I just… we need a plan. Or at least more than two of us. We’re good at dumb ideas, but this? This is a war crime idea.”
“She’ll be here,” Eddie said.
Will raised an eyebrow. “Ashley?”
Eddie gave a single nod. “She said she’d bring who she could. Told us to keep the library open.”
They both looked to Claire.
She didn’t meet their eyes, but she reached behind the desk and flicked the enchanted “CLOSED” sign to “OPEN — Midnight Access Permitted.”
The lanterns glowed a little brighter. The old wooden doors creaked once, as if sensing something important was about to happen.
Outside, wind howled through the stained glass windows.
And then—
Footsteps echoed down the hall.
Eddie turned.
The doors groaned open.
Ashley stepped through, wand in hand, cloak draped over one shoulder like she hadn’t even tried to fasten it properly. Her hair was wind-tossed, eyes sharp.
“Took you long enough,” Eddie said, trying to lighten the mood, though his voice cracked halfway through.
Ashley gave him a smirk. “What, and miss your brooding hour?”
Then the rest of them followed in behind her—and suddenly, the library felt a lot smaller.
First came Henry Marais, tall and broad-shouldered, ducking slightly beneath the doorway. His coat was grease-stained, his dreadlocks pulled into a loose tie behind his head. He walked with the kind of quiet calm that made people listen when he finally spoke. Two other students flanked him—both from the Automaton Engineering department, judging by the brass gauntlet and gear-stained gloves one of them wore.
Then came Victoria.
Eddie stiffened.
Her blonde hair was perfectly brushed, tucked behind one ear in that deliberate way she always did when she wanted to look serious. Her angular face caught the lamplight like a polished blade, and she moved like she owned the place—even here, in their secret midnight war council.
And she hadn’t come alone either.
Two more followed in her wake—both girls in the deep red cloaks of Arcane Studies. One had her wand already drawn. The other adjusted her enchanted spectacles and started scanning the library like she was calculating battlefield positions.
Eddie turned sharply to Ashley, lowering his voice. “Why did you bring her?”
Ashley folded her arms. “Because we need everyone who can help. And Victoria’s one of them.”
“But—”
“I know. She’s a pain in the ass,” Ashley said. “But she’s smart. She knows the underground better than any of us—her dad’s one of the city planners. She also speaks fluent Runic and got top marks in Strategic Theory. She’ll help us get in and out.”
Eddie glanced back at Victoria, who was now inspecting a large map on the wall like she was preparing to siege the entire city.
He rubbed the back of his neck. “If she gets smug, I’m blaming you.”
“Please,” Ashley muttered, “she’s already smug. Let’s just hope she stays useful too.”
The newcomers settled in around the long reading table. Claire rose from behind the desk and slowly approached, her arms crossed tightly as if holding herself together.
Everyone sat, but no one truly relaxed. Jackets weren’t taken off. Wands weren’t stowed away. Eyes flicked to windows, to shadows between shelves. Even the ancient grandfather clock in the corner seemed to tick louder in the silence.
A low murmur rippled across the table—half-conversations, shared glances, whispered doubts.
“Wait, your dog’s been missing too?” Ashley asked Victoria quietly.
Victoria gave a curt nod. “Three nights now. He never runs off. I’ve had him since I was ten.”
“He’s not the only one,” one of Henry’s friends muttered. “Kazi’s been gone for almost a week. He left the dorms to check out one of the underground service tunnels by the South Wall. Never came back.”
Henry said nothing, but the way his jaw tightened told Eddie all he needed to know.
Will leaned closer. “This... this is bigger than we thought.”
Eddie didn’t answer. His mind buzzed with half-formed thoughts, pieces of information slotting into place, and yet, nothing felt solid. The weight in the room was pressing inward. They were all waiting. Waiting for someone to tell them what to do.
He glanced at Claire.
She met his eyes, then said, “You should tell them.”
Eddie blinked. “Me?”
“I’ve already told you everything I know,” she said, voice steadier than her trembling fingers. “It’s got to be you.”
Eddie looked to Will. Will gave a small, nervous shrug.
He looked around the table. Victoria’s cold stare. Henry’s quiet fury. Ashley’s expectant gaze. Strangers and almost-friends, sitting in a half-lit library, surrounded by dust and books and fear—and now all looking at him.
He wasn’t the best alchemist in the room.
He wasn’t the smartest or the fastest or the most powerful.
But he was the one who’d promised to bring Madeleine home.
So he stood.
It wasn’t graceful. His knee bumped the table, and his voice caught in his throat—but he stood anyway.
And then he spoke.
“There’s something you all need to know,” Eddie began, eyes scanning the faces around the table. “I didn’t believe any of this at first either. Not really. Not until I saw it.”
He took a breath.
“A few weeks ago, I fell asleep at the Book Pirates’ hideout. I was copying one of the books we’d taken—something about ancient transmutations. I left way too late, past midnight. The streets were empty, dead quiet. I was walking back toward the dorms when I saw someone ahead. Thought it was just a guy walking home.”
Eddie’s hand hovered near his chest. His voice dropped.
“But when he turned—he wasn’t human.”
He could still see it when he closed his eyes: the twisted form stepping into the lantern light. The way its limbs moved wrong. Like they didn’t belong to the same body. The gleam of half-human eyes in a too-wide face, the black claws curling from thick fingers.
“It had claws. Fangs. It came at me fast. I ran—but not fast enough.”
He pulled up the hem of his shirt, just slightly. A trio of jagged red scars slashed across his ribs, faint but unmistakable.
“Got me here. I would’ve been gone if the police hadn’t shown up. They didn’t believe what I saw, of course. Called it a ‘drunken assault.’ Took my statement and moved on.”
He let the shirt fall back into place.
“But it was real. It’s real. And Madeleine knew that too.”
Eddie turned slightly, nodding toward Claire.
“She and Madeleine started investigating the disappearances. Claire was part of a student group from the Mythical Creatures Conservatory—creature advocates. They’d heard rumors about strange things being captured, tortured, used for experiments. Madeleine wanted the truth.”
He looked down, jaw tight.
“And now she’s gone.”
Claire flinched slightly but didn’t look away.
“She went to that district by the old aqueducts. She didn’t tell me because she knew I’d try to stop her. But Claire got out. She saw everything. She told me everything.”
He turned back to the group.
“There’s a facility. Hidden under one of the closed-down subway maintenance sites. Claire told me about the layout. The rotating guards. Their routes. How to get in—and how many people we’ll probably have to sneak past.”
A hush fell over the group again.
“And she told me something else,” Eddie said, voice sharpening. “Walther Schroder is involved.”
That drew a few startled looks. Henry leaned forward.
“Wait, the second-year alchemist? I’ve seen him at Professor Caledon’s lectures.”
Eddie nodded. “He’s working with them. I don’t know if he was always part of it, or if they pulled him in later, but he’s been helping them build something down there. Something twisted. He knew Madeleine. He knew Claire.”
His voice darkened.
“And he knows me. We were friends. He’ll be expecting me.”
There was a long silence. The weight of what Eddie said hung heavy over the room.

            <Title>Chapter 14E</Title>
            <Text>Walt and Fred, loyal cultists of the Black Hand. Cloaked in the familiar, shadowy garb of their order, they navigate the dimly lit corridors of the fortress with a practiced efficiency. Their eyes, sharp and calculating, sweep over the rough-hewn stone walls, searching for any anomaly, any hint of intrusion. Unlike their brethren, however, they are not susceptible to the shimmering illusion veils meticulously woven by Christine and Geralt. A nagging suspicion, born from their past encounters with Eddie, festers in the back of their minds.
&quot;What do you make of all this, Fred?&quot; Walt murmurs, his voice a low rumble laced with unease.
Fred, his brow furrowed in a contemplative frown, echoes his companion's disquiet. &quot;It's unsettling, Walt. The others seem…agitated. On edge, like something’s amiss. And the disruption in the communication channels – that can't be a simple malfunction.&quot;
Walt nods curtly, his mind a whirlwind of possibilities. The unexpected silence from the communication channels, the palpable tension that crackled in the air – all pointed towards something far more sinister than a mundane technical difficulty. &quot;We need answers, Fred,&quot; he says, his voice hardening with resolve. &quot;Let's head to the communications room first. Whatever's brewing within these walls, it likely has its roots there.&quot;
As they weave their way through the labyrinthine corridors, their path intersects with a group of agitated cultists. Walt and Fred exchange a silent glance, a silent question hanging heavy in the air. With measured steps, they approach the group, their expressions composed masks concealing the churning unease within.
&quot;What troubles you, brothers?&quot; Walt inquires, his voice deceptively calm.
One of the cultists, his face etched with a mixture of confusion and concern, steps forward. &quot;We've lost contact with the lower cells,&quot; he stammers. &quot;The others… they grow restless. They inquire about the location of the sacrifices, claiming they have urgent business with them before the ceremony.&quot;
Walt's heart plummets, a cold dread slithering down his spine. He locks eyes with Fred, a flicker of shared understanding passing between them. Something is terribly wrong, a sinister force worming its way into the carefully laid plans of the Black Hand.
&quot;Thank you for the information, brother,&quot; Walt replies, his voice betraying none of the turmoil within. &quot;We will investigate this matter further. Rest assured, order will be restored.&quot;
As the group disperses, Walt throws Fred a pointed look, his eyes blazing with determination. &quot;We need to check the cells. Whatever darkness stirs down there, we need to snuff it out.&quot;
Fred, his jaw clenched tight, mirrors his companion's resolve. &quot;Agreed. But the communications room – shouldn't we…&quot;
Walt hesitates for a moment, his mind racing. Divided loyalties and a desperate need for answers war within him. Finally, a decision is made.
&quot;You go check the communications room, Fred,&quot; he instructs. &quot;See if you can find the source of the disruption. I'll handle the cells. We need to cover all our grounds.&quot;
With a curt nod of acknowledgement, Fred peels away, disappearing into the shadows like a wraith. Walt, his heart pounding a frantic tattoo against his ribs, continues his descent towards the lower cells. The weight of suspicion presses down on him, a suffocating cloak in the frigid air. He is no longer just a loyal cultist; he is a man on a mission, determined to uncover the truth and expose the treachery that lurks within the very heart of the Black Hand.
-o-
But as they neared the finish line, a cold dread prickled at the edges of Eddie's awareness. The distant clatter of boots against stone grew steadily louder, punctuated by the murmur of raised voices. The cultists were returning, and time was a relentless tide pulling them back towards danger.
&quot;Will!&quot; Eddie hissed, his voice barely a whisper above the hammering of his own heart. &quot;They're coming. We have to pick up the pace!&quot;
Will, ever the vigilant lookout, scanned the corridor with a practiced eye. &quot;Understood, Eddie,&quot; he replied, his voice tense but steady. &quot;Leave the rest to me. Focus on getting everyone out.&quot;
With a renewed surge of urgency, Eddie and Ashley ushered the remaining captives through the shimmering veil. Their movements were a practiced dance, efficient and silent. But as they reached the final two figures, a wave of despair washed over Eddie.
&quot;We're out of time,&quot; Ashley murmured beside him, her voice heavy with frustration. &quot;There are still two left.&quot;
Panic threatened to consume Eddie, but he forced himself to think. He darted a glance towards Will, a lone sentinel guarding the entrance, expertly deflecting any approaching cultists.
&quot;Will!&quot; he called out, his voice laced with desperation. &quot;We need a distraction. Can you hold them off for a few moments?&quot;
Will glanced back, his eyes hardening with resolve. &quot;I'll buy you what time I can, Eddie. Just get them out of here!&quot;
A silent understanding passed between them. Eddie turned back to Ashley, a newfound determination burning in his eyes. &quot;We'll create a diversion. You get these last two to safety.&quot;
Ashley, never one to back down from a challenge, met his gaze with a resolute nod. &quot;Understood. Don't worry about me, Eddie. Get yourselves out of this too.&quot;
Together, they emerged from the cell room, stepping back into the dimly lit corridor. The approaching sounds were now clear – a cacophony of stomping boots and barked orders. Eddie felt a surge of fear, raw and primal, but he squashed it down. They were in this together, and they wouldn't give up without a fight.
With Ashley by his side, Eddie squared his shoulders and met the approaching cultists head-on. His voice, though trembling slightly, rang out with defiance. &quot;There you are! What's the hold-up? We need those prisoners for the ceremony!&quot;
The cultists stumbled to a halt, their faces contorted in confusion. This wasn't part of the plan. Eddie, channeling his fear into righteous anger, pressed on.
&quot;They're…unruly,&quot; he lied, his voice dripping with mock frustration. &quot;Giving us a bit of trouble. We'll have them ready soon enough!&quot;
The lead cultist, a hulking brute with a scarred face, narrowed his eyes suspiciously. &quot;See that you do,&quot; he growled, his voice laced with a barely veiled threat. &quot;Lord Raven won't be pleased with any delays.&quot;
Eddie feigned a placating smile. &quot;Of course not. We wouldn't dream of it.&quot;
As the cultists lingered for a moment longer, their gazes lingering on Eddie and Ashley with suspicion, Ashley slipped past them, urging the remaining captives along with her. Each precious second stretched into an eternity until finally, the cultists grunted and turned away, their heavy footsteps fading further down the corridor.
Eddie and Ashley exchanged a quick glance, relief washing over their faces. They had bought precious moments, a sliver of hope against the encroaching darkness. With a silent nod, they slipped back into the cell room, ready to face whatever challenges awaited them next.
-o-
Will, a sentinel at his post outside the cellar door, vibrated with a nervous energy. Each rustle of clothing from within the cell room sent a jolt through him, a counterpoint to the thrill of their plan unfolding. Relief, however, was a fleeting visitor. A hulking figure materialized from the dimly lit corridor, his black robes billowing around him like a shroud. Will's heart lurched – a single cultist shouldn't inspire such dread, yet this one carried an aura of grim purpose.
&quot;Halt,&quot; Will barked, his voice firm despite the tremor in his gut. The cultist stopped, his shadowed face unreadable beneath the depths of his hood. But the intensity of his gaze, like a predator locking onto its prey, sent shivers down Will's spine.
&quot;Identify yourself and state your business,&quot; Will demanded, buying time as his mind raced for a plan.
The cultist remained silent for a moment, the tension stretching like a taut bowstring. Finally, a gruff voice rasped from within the hood. &quot;I require access to the cellar. Now.&quot;
Will's mind spun. He couldn't let this intruder discover their covert operation. Time to call upon his bardic charm, honed over years of captivating audiences. He plastered on a placating smile, his voice oozing false sincerity. &quot;Ah, of course, brother! But unforeseen circumstances have arisen. The cellar is, shall we say, indisposed at present. We're conducting a… private ceremony, a sacred rite that demands absolute focus.&quot;
The cultist didn't seem to appreciate the performance. His brow furrowed, and a flicker of suspicion ignited in the depths of his shadowed eyes. &quot;A ceremony, you say? This wasn't mentioned in the reports.&quot; His voice held a dangerous edge.
Will's smile faltered for a moment, but he quickly recovered. &quot;Ah, a last-minute addition, a divine calling, you understand. Most holy and… well, best not disturbed.&quot; He forced a hearty laugh, the sound echoing hollowly in the oppressive silence.
But the act wasn't fooling the cultist. &quot;There's something amiss here,&quot; he growled, his voice dropping to a menacing snarl. &quot;Show me the cellar, or I'll report your disobedience to the higher order.&quot;
Panic clawed at Will's throat. He couldn't fight his way out, not with the element of surprise lost. Just as despair threatened to consume him, the cultist spoke again, his words shattering Will's carefully constructed facade.
&quot;Will,&quot; the voice rasped, laden with a chilling recognition. &quot;I know who you are.&quot;
The blood drained from Will's face. His carefully crafted persona crumbled like sandcastles under a tidal wave. How? How could this be happening? Their mission had been meticulously planned, their identities a closely guarded secret.
Dread, cold and suffocating, coiled around his heart. He recognized the voice now, a voice from a lifetime ago, a voice filled with laughter and camaraderie during countless nights spent singing around a crackling campfire. Walt, Eddie's old friend, their former bandmate. The weight of their shared past pressed down on him, a stark reminder of the choices that had led them to this dark confrontation.
Walt stepped forward, his face emerging from the shadows. Gone was the easy grin and mischievous glint in his eyes, replaced by a cold, unforgiving stare. &quot;I know what you're doing, Will,&quot; he said, his voice laced with a deadly calm. &quot;And you won't get away with it.&quot;
Will's mind reeled. Betrayal. Recognition. An old friend turned foe. The weight of the situation pressed down on him, his carefully constructed bravado replaced by a gnawing fear. He had to act, and fast. But before he could formulate a response, Walt lunged forward, his hand outstretched to grab Will's arm. Will instinctively dodged, the fight-or-flight response kicking in. The facade had shattered, and the real battle – for their freedom, for their lives – was about to begin.

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 3 V3</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stepped off the ferry first, tossing a few coins to the ferryman before offering a hand to Torrie. As her boots hit the wooden planks, she immediately turned to take in their surroundings, but Eddie tugged his flat cap lower over his forehead, his gaze flickering warily over the busy dock.
The air here was different—crisper, drier. It lacked the thick, briny scent of Weshaven, replaced instead by the rich aromas of spice crates being unloaded, the earthy tang of dried herbs, and the occasional whiff of parchment and ink from merchants tallying their stock.
Osthaven was busier in a different way. Where Weshaven had the steady rhythm of fishermen mending nets and gutting the morning’s catch, Osthaven hummed with the brisk efficiency of trade. Dockhands hauled crates marked with foreign sigils, couriers weaved through carts, and merchants haggled over silk and spices from distant lands.
Torrie took it all in, wide-eyed. “It’s… bigger than I thought.”
Eddie forced a smirk. “Told you. Less fish guts, more commerce.”
But even as he spoke, his steps were measured, his shoulders tense beneath his coat. He pulled his flat cap down further, a quiet gesture of habit—of avoidance of the last time he’d walked these streets.
He tried not to think about it. Tried not to wonder if someone in the crowd might recognize him, might turn and whisper. It had been a year, but memories had a way of lingering.
Torrie, oblivious to his unease, strode ahead, drinking in every detail.
&quot;Look at that!&quot; she pointed excitedly to a trio of scholars in deep blue robes, their arms laden with books as they argued in hushed, hurried tones. &quot;Are they from the university?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eddie muttered. &quot;Researchers, probably. Aella’s got plenty of them.&quot;
They continued down the road, weaving through colorful stalls and past warehouse workers shouting orders.
Eddie’s gaze landed on a small stall by the corner, where the scent of roasted chestnuts drifted through the air. His fingers brushed against the strap of his bag as a familiar memory surfaced.
&quot;See that?&quot; He nudged Torrie. &quot;Markus and I used to stop there after classes. We’d split a bag of chestnuts and complain about assignments the whole way home.&quot;
Torrie wrinkled her nose. &quot;You two really bonded over complaining, huh?&quot;
Eddie smirked. &quot;It’s an art form, I tell you.&quot;
But the warmth of nostalgia faded too quickly, replaced by the weight pressing at his ribs. He shouldn’t be here. Not for long.
As they walked past a faded green awning, his steps faltered.
&quot;And that place,&quot; he pointed, voice quieter now, &quot;was where I used to get supplies for my… projects.&quot;
Torrie arched a brow. &quot;What kind of projects?&quot;
&quot;Alchemy, mostly,&quot; Eddie said, exhaling softly. &quot;The owner—grumpiest old man you'd ever meet—used to grumble about every single request I made, but he never actually turned me away.&quot;
Torrie grinned. &quot;Sounds like he liked you.&quot;
Eddie scoffed. “I think he just liked my coins.”
The humor felt thin, fleeting. His fingers curled slightly, pressing into his palms. It was strange, being back. The streets hadn’t changed, but everything felt different.
Torrie, still beaming, nudged him lightly. “You’ve been here a lot, huh?”
Eddie hesitated before nodding. “Yeah… long ago.”
“Well,” Torrie said, her voice light, “now I’m here too.”
Eddie huffed a quiet laugh, shaking his head as if to brush away the past. “Yeah. Let’s get you to Aella.”

-o-
As they left the bustle of Osthaven behind, the roads stretched wider, the houses growing sparser until they gave way to rolling fields and clusters of trees. The scent of salt and spice was gradually replaced by damp earth and the fresh, clean air of the countryside.
Torrie clung to Eddie’s coat from her seat on the back of the bicycle, her voice bright with curiosity. &quot;Are we almost there?&quot;
&quot;Still a ways to go,&quot; Eddie said, pedaling steadily. &quot;We have to go through the forest first.&quot;
She tilted her head. “Forest?”
The road sloped upward, and as they crested the hill, the trees thickened. Oaks and pines stretched high, their boughs intertwining to form a dense canopy overhead. Shadows pooled beneath them, deep and unmoving. The further they went, the heavier the air seemed, as if they had crossed into another world entirely.
Then, the first glimmers of light appeared—small, golden blossoms lining the path, their petals glowing softly like embers in the dusk. The light wove between the cracks in the stone pavement, illuminating the way forward.
A rustle came from the trees. Then, a low, distant call. Not quite a growl, not quite a voice—something in between.
Torrie tensed. “Eddie…” she murmured. “Is it safe here?”
“Yeah,” Eddie replied, his voice even. “It’s just an Illusory Forest.”
She clutched his coat a little tighter. “Illusory?”
“Yeah. There are plenty of ‘em in Osthaven,” he said. “Scarwich Grove—this one—isn’t too bad. There’s another near here, the Northern Gibdon Depth. That one’s trickier, denser. The deeper you go, the stranger they get.” 
Torrie hesitated before asking, “Is there one back in Weshaven?”
“Yeah,” he said, slower this time. “But it’s different. Older. Nobody goes in—not even Aella students. It’s the deepest Illusory Forest in Solivia.”
Torrie swallowed. “Why?”
“The one back in Weshaven is called the Deep Glaive,” Eddie said. “It’s said to go so deep, it swallows anything that enters. It’s full of ruins—Elven ruins, from the Nocturnilus Period. Some say it’s cursed. Others say it’s just been forgotten.”
The trees around them whispered as they passed, but Eddie kept his eyes ahead.
“But don’t worry though.” Eddie continued, “This one’s not as dense as others.” He gestured at the glowing flowers.  “These will keep us safe.”
Torrie peered down at them. “What kind of flowers are they?”
Eddie didn’t answer right away. The soft whir of the bike’s wheels filled the silence, the golden blossoms casting faint, flickering patterns on his hands. His grip on the handlebars tightened.
Finally, he murmured, “Eden Flowers.”
There was something distant in his voice, something just out of reach. Torrie glanced up at him, but his face was set, his eyes fixed ahead, unreadable. It wasn’t like him to hesitate over a simple question.
The bike rolled on, past the flowers swaying gently in the cold morning breeze.
The forest thickened around them, but the path remained clear. A warm hush filled the air, like a place caught between worlds.
Torrie’s curiosity sparked again. “So… what else makes an Illusory Forest like this special?”
Eddie’s grip on the handlebars shifted. “The arcane flow here is denser,” he said. “It gathers in the forest itself. It makes spellcasting easier—you’ll see once you start practicing.”
He hesitated, then added, “But it also makes the forest… strange. Paths shift. Sounds echo. Some people say the trees whisper, but that’s probably just superstition.”
Torrie frowned. “Why does that happen?”
Eddie exhaled, adjusting his grip. “I don’t really know,” he admitted. “It’s something to do with the way the arcane flows in the forest, but I never really studied that. If you want real answers, you should ask the Conjuration teachers. They’re the ones who understand all these weird arcane stuff.”
The reassurance settled over her, but still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this place held more than it let on.
They rode on, the golden glow flickering at their sides. Then, slowly, the trees began to thin. Their towering forms shrank away, letting sunlight trickle back in. The air grew warmer, the scent of earth replaced by something lighter, drier.
And then—open space.
The forest fell away behind them, revealing rolling fields of golden hay, stretching endlessly beneath the afternoon sky. Farmhouses dotted the hills, smoke curling gently from their chimneys. The road dipped downward, and as they coasted down the slope, a grand structure rose in the distance.
Torrie’s breath caught.
Aella Academy.
Perched atop a hill, its spires gleamed in the sun, its stonework bright against the sky. The domed towers stood tall, their stained-glass windows glinting like gemstones. A wide bridge arched over a gentle river, leading to an iron-gated entrance. Beyond the gates, students in deep blue robes moved across sprawling courtyards, their voices carrying in the wind.
Torrie tightened her grip around Eddie’s waist.
He exhaled, slow and measured.
“Welcome to Aella,” he murmured.
-o-

Eddie pedaled through the last stretch of road, the cobbled streets of Osthaven giving way to packed dirt as they left the bustle of town behind. Fields of golden hay swayed gently in the morning breeze, stretching far and wide, their soft rustling the only sound accompanying them now.
And then, past the gentle slope of the hill, Aella Academy came into view.
It stood just as Eddie remembered—tall, sturdy, with its weathered stone walls and a modest courtyard nestled at its center. It wasn’t the grandest school in Solivia, not the kind spoken of in hushed reverence like Edenfield, but around here, it was everything. A place of learning, discipline, and quiet ambition.
Eddie slowed the bike to a stop near the front gate. Torrie hopped off, adjusting her satchel, her eyes gleaming as she took in the sight before her.
“Well,” she said, turning to him, a wide grin breaking across her face, “I guess this is it.”
 “You’ll do fine, Torrie.” Eddie said, forcing a small smirk. “You better not cause too much trouble.”
She stuck her tongue out playfully before stepping forward, her pace quickening until she was practically skipping through the front gate.
Eddie lingered by the entrance, watching her go. 
He saw himself in her.
The same eagerness, the same restless energy that had carried him through these very gates years ago. He remembered what it was like, standing on the threshold of something new, looking ahead and seeing only possibility.
Now, he stood on the other side of it.
Eddie let out a quiet breath, gripping the handles a little tighter before shaking his head.
“Go get ‘em, Torrie.”
And with that, he turned the bike around and started pedaling back towards town.
He just had to get back to town, maybe find a quiet corner to sit for a while before catching the ferry home. But as he was about to mount his bike, a voice cut through the crowds of students.
“Edward!”
He flinched. His fingers tightened around the handlebars. For a second, he considered pretending he hadn’t heard. Plenty of students had the name Edward, right? It didn’t have to be him.
“Edward!… Welton!”
Eddie slowed, his stomach knotting. Slowly, hesitantly, he turned his head.
Near the front gate of Aella Academy, amidst the stream of students hurrying into the school, stood Mr. Ferie. Eddie’s old Alchemy mentor was just as he remembered—dark-skinned, balding, his round brass glasses perched on his nose, and an ever-present spark of energy in his step despite his age. The students passing by greeted him with cheerful nods and waves, a testament to how well-liked he was. And then, as he spotted Eddie, his face lit up with recognition, his hoarse but warm voice cutting through the morning air.
Mr. Ferie strode toward him, clapping a firm hand on his shoulder. “Hah! I thought that was you! It’s been years! How have you been, my boy?”
Eddie swallowed, forcing his lips into something that resembled a smile. “Uh… yeah. It’s been a while.”
Mr. Ferie beamed. “More than a while! I haven’t seen you since—” He paused, brow furrowing slightly as he searched for the last memory he had of Eddie. Then, his face brightened again. “Ah, since that competition! You had the judges hanging onto your every word—Professor Borman from Edenfield even wrote you a recommendation, didn’t he?” He chuckled, adjusting his brass-rimmed glasses. “So? Did you take the chance? Studying Alchemy at Edenfield, I hope?”
Eddie felt something sour coil in his stomach. He gripped the strap of his bag a little tighter.
“Something like that.”
Mr. Ferie chuckled. “Ah, I knew it. You always had a mind for it, Edward. All those competitions—still remember the time you turned an iron ingot into living vinework? That was a masterpiece! One of the finest young alchemists I ever had the pleasure of mentoring.”
Eddie stiffened. He could feel the expectation in Mr. Ferie’s voice, the unshaken belief in who he used to be.
His hands felt clammy. The last thing he wanted was to stand here, listening to praise that didn’t belong to him anymore.
Mr. Ferie, oblivious to his unease, clapped his hands together. “So! What brings you back to Osthaven? Surely not just a visit?”
Eddie shifted his weight. “Just dropping someone off.”
“Oh? A friend?”
“My… sister.”
Mr. Ferie’s brows lifted. “Torrie, was it? Following in your footsteps, then! That’s wonderful.”
Eddie forced a chuckle, but it barely held.
Mr. Ferie sighed wistfully. “Ah, you know, I always hoped I’d see you again, Edward. You had such promise. I can only imagine the things you’ve accomplished since Edenfield.”
Eddie’s throat tightened. He glanced away, fingers gripping the strap of his bag as if it could anchor him. His mind scrambled for an exit.
Lie. Tell him you’re doing fine. That you’re excelling. That you’re still the student he remembers.
But the words wouldn’t come.
“I—uh, I should get going,” Eddie blurted. “Mum’s expecting me.”
Mr. Ferie blinked, surprise flickering across his face. “Oh? Well, I suppose we’ll catch up properly another time—”
But Eddie was already moving, swinging himself onto his bike. “Yeah—yeah, of course,” he called over his shoulder, forcing a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
And then he was pedaling away, fast enough that the cobbled road rattled beneath his tires. Fast enough that Mr. Ferie’s voice faded into the morning hum of Aella Academy. Fast enough that he didn’t have to see the warmth in his mentor’s eyes turn into something else—realization, maybe, or disappointment.
He didn’t look back.


-o-

Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the hum of the town buzzing around him. The salty breeze had thinned, replaced by the scent of fresh bread, spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach reminded him, with a low grumble, that breakfast had been hurried.
He slowed to a stop near a familiar stall, the one that sold honeyed almonds and sesame biscuits. The sight alone pulled him back to old routines—grabbing a bag for himself, an extra for Markus. It had been a while, but some habits never quite faded.
After paying the vendor, he stepped back toward his bicycle, ready to sling the bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
A building stood across the street, its architecture different from the others around it. Age clung to its stone walls, yet the towering columns bore intricate carvings, their shapes unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, but their elegance remained, a relic of a bygone era.
Above the heavy wooden doors, an emblem was set in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into the worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, something stirring in his chest. He hadn’t noticed it before—maybe he had never cared to look. But now, standing there, it felt like the building was watching him back.
Eyes tracing the contours of the emblem, Eddie lingered a moment longer, the owl’s unblinking gaze seeming almost knowing. The Sage Institute. He knew nothing about it—had never needed to—but something about it gnawed at the edges of his mind. A curiosity, fleeting yet persistent.
With a breath, he shook it off, tucking the bag of snacks securely inside his satchel before turning back to his bicycle. The world outside his thoughts rushed back in—the chatter of merchants, the rhythmic clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the occasional call of dockworkers hauling cargo.
He swung a leg over the bike and pushed off, weaving through the streets of Osthaven with practiced ease. The town passed him by in a blur of nostalgia and familiarity, but his mind remained half elsewhere, lingering on the building, on the emblem, on the feeling.
The distant chime of a bell tower reminded him of the time. He wasn’t in a hurry, but he didn’t want to miss the next ferry back to Weshaven either.
By the time he reached the harbor, the ferry was already boarding. He rolled his bicycle up the gangway, found a quiet spot near the railing, and exhaled, letting the sea breeze wash over him.
Back to Weshaven. Back to his routines.

            <Title>Chapter 32 RAW </Title>
            <Text>
And so, after that day, Eddie had left the apothecary.
For the first time in so many years, Eddie excused himself from his parents, Markus and everyone at the apothecary that Eddie will be taking a break from the potion mixing to study Alchemy, everyone at the apothecary rechieved it well.
Since then, for everyday he would wake up early, tidy up his bedroom and took his sister to school now that he had time to do that. He would board the ferry into Osthaven with her, but it wasn’t just for Torrie, what Eddie was looking for was the library in it.
The library was located not far from the Sage Institute building, but it is still a library curated by the Sage’s Institute. It wasn’t such a big library, but it houses enough books for Eddie to study on.
And so Eddie sat down for the entire day, books mounting on his pile on and on as he continued reading, notebooks filled with notes upon notes from different books as he studied a theory and find a book to challenge the previous one. 
And when the day was over, he went back to Aella Academy, talked to Mr. Ferie about what he had learned and took Torrie home.
And thus was his new routine, for days.
Days has gone into weeks
Exam is approaching.

-o-

The ebbs and flows of the ferry boat lulls him in his reluctant sleep, Weeks of relentless study had taken its toll on him. His hair was more unkempt than usual, tufts sticking up where he’d run his fingers through it in frustration. Heavy shadows under his  eyes indicates the sleepless nights chasing formulas and theories. He blinked hard, fighting the pull of sleep as the tram jolted over another bump. 
On his lap lay a dishevelled pile of notes. Some in precise, orderly handwriting, others in his own frantic scrawl. It’s barely legible after feverish study sessions. Intricate alchemical diagrams spiralled across the pages like cryptic secrets. Each symbol is a lifeline connecting him to an Alchemist’s teachings. He clutched them tightly, a bridge between himself and the elusive mastery of alchemy he could almost feel slipping through his tired fingers. 

The steam horn blows, indicating its arrival into Osthaven. Eddie jolted awake, he gathered his notes and puts them in his satchel, this is it.

Eddie stood in front of the Sage’s Institute, feeling the pulse of the place that had once overwhelmed him. Two weeks prior, its towering stone façade, wrapped in ancient ivy and etched with weatherworn details, had struck awe into his heart. It made him feel small and uncertain. Today, though, his view had shifted. The imposing structure, with its iron-framed windows and the owl-emblazoned emblem above the double oak doors, was no longer a symbol of wonder and intimidation. It was now a challenge—something he was determined to conquer.
The entrance loomed, daring him forward. With his bag slung over his shoulder, Eddie steeled himself as he approached the doors. The scent of old parchment, ink, and polished wood filled his lungs as he stepped inside. As he entered the reception hall, the glow of warm, golden light from the chandeliers bathed the scene in a challenging warmth. The floor tiles hummed beneath his feet, each one etched with softly glowing runes. The knowledge and wisdom within these walls were palpable, like a current of energy thrumming beneath the surface.
Eddie took in the circular chamber with wide eyes. At its heart was the massive mahogany desk. Staffed by blue-robed clerks who attended to the quiet stream of students and scholars with an air of precision. Behind them was a grand, engraved map of Solivia and its surrounding realms. Golden pins marked affiliated schools, each one a testament to the reach and influence of the Institute.
For a brief moment, Eddie felt the old wonder bubble up, but it quickly gave way to renewed purpose. He scanned the room, taking in the portraits of past scholars with their solemn, assessing gazes that seemed to measure each newcomer. Eddie met their stares, silently vowing to prove himself worthy of the path they had once trod. His journey might have started with uncertainty, but now, standing in the Institute’s grand halls, he felt his purpose sharpen.
Eddie approached the reception desk, heart pounding, but he kept his expression steady. His fingers clenched around the strap of his bag as he forced himself to breathe steadily. Despite the familiar weight of nervousness in his chest, he reminded himself why he was here and coming this far. He couldn’t let fear slip through now.
“I’m here for the entrance exam,” he said, his voice more assertive than he felt. “I’m scheduled for today, Faculty of Alchemy, Edenfield University.”
The receptionist is a middle-aged woman. A bored expression in her eyes, she barely looked up from her ledger. Her eyes flicked over him. Taking in his travel-worn clothes, the faint circles under his eyes, and the ink-stained notes poking out of his bag. She raised an eyebrow, unimpressed.
“No alchemy exams scheduled for today,” she said flatly, flipping a page, as if dismissing him entirely.
Eddie blinked, thrown off balance. His nerves surged into confusion, and for a moment, the confidence he’d been holding onto wavered. His mind raced as he searched for an explanation. Had he made a mistake? Had the letter given the wrong date? No, he remembered it clearly. He’d checked it more times than he could count.
He forced himself to stand a little straighter. “Are you certain? I received an invitation from the Sage’s Institute itself. This is my scholarship exam.”
The woman sighed, glancing at him again, with perhaps a trace of interest in her otherwise disinterested gaze.
The receptionist’s gaze hardened with finality. “No exam for today,” she said, returning to her ledger.
Eddie’s heart dropped, but the shock quickly gave way to a determined resolve. He wasn’t about to be dismissed so easily. Reaching into his bag, he pulled out the letter he’d kept carefully folded. Emma Somers signed the invitation herself. He held it out, his hand steady.
“Here. This letter,” he said, keeping his tone respectful yet firm. “It’s from Emma Somers. She asked me to come today.
The woman looked at the letter with raised eyebrows, then, as though sensing a shift in the situation, she took it. Her eyes moved over the parchment slowly. Her expression softened with something close to interest. She looked up at him, now with a different sort of scrutiny.
“Hmm,” she murmured, folding the letter back and giving it to him. Her lips quirked, and there was a new gleam in her eye as she regarded him. “Very well. Go through to the second hall on the right.”
Eddie tucked the letter safely into his bag and nodded, exhaling as he felt a fresh surge of energy. Holding his head high, he stepped past the desk. Feeling the weight of the Institute’s stone halls surrounding him, he made his way to the hall.
Eddie stepped into the second hall, and his breath caught. The space was vast. Its vaulted ceiling stretches high above, like the dome of some ancient cathedral. The air here felt different. Reverent, almost sacred. It carries the faint scent of parchment, ink, and something else. Alchemical, like copper and ash, linger long after an experiment. Lining the hall’s walls, gilded frames encased seven portraits. Each one a silent sentinel watching over those who dared tread this path. This was no ordinary gallery; it was a hall dedicated to studying Alchemical Knowledge. A space reserved for those embarking on the rigorous journey of Alchemical mastery.
Eddie’s gaze drifted across the portraits, taking in the sombre, powerful faces of the Master Alchemists. Legends whose contributions had shaped the very foundation of Alchemy itself. Careful, ornate lettering on brass plaques beneath each portrait displays their names. Carried the weight of history.
Master Alchemist Magnus Borman — a stern figure. Piercing eyes, his beard streaked with silver. The codices said he had perfected the formula for stabilising volatile transmutations.
Master Alchemist Dale Singleton — depicted younger than Eddie expected. His sharp grin betraying a mischievous brilliance. Singleton had revolutionised the use of alchemical catalysts.
Master Alchemist Lucy Manning — her calm expression belied the fire in her gaze. A pioneer who had pushed the limits of elemental transmutations.
Master Alchemist Rebecca Stafford — an elegant woman in a velvet gown. She is holding an intricate transmutation circle in her hands. Rumoured to have unlocked the secrets of organic alchemy.
Master Alchemist Hatiim al-Kader — his deep-set eyes seemed to follow Eddie. The scholar who codified Alchemy’s first universal laws. His silhouette was lean and severe. Robed in layered garments with intricate calligraphy stitched into every fold.
Master Alchemist Faraah el-Hosein — depicted in desert robes with gold-threaded hems. Known for merging cultural philosophies into alchemical practice. El-Hosein’s work had unified diverse alchemical philosophies. Merging the Eastern traditions of balance and spirit with the more rigid sciences of the West.
And finally, at the end of the hall, Eddie’s eyes fell on a face he knew all too well.
Master Alchemist Catherine — the Elf.
Eddie felt a swell of both wonder and pride. A fresh realisation of just how much of her knowledge she’d shared with him. He couldn’t help but feel the weight of that inheritance on his shoulders. She wasn’t just his aunt, but an indelible part of magical history.
Catherine had no surname; she never needed one. Rendered in striking, exquisite detail. The portrait stood apart, not for its style, but because of the person it depicted. Her angular Elven features, pale skin, and sharp green eyes were impossible to mistake. Her vibrant red hair framed her face in waves, just as he remembered. The painting portrayed her with a quiet, composed expression that carried the weight of her legacy. She wore her characteristic red overcoat. Layered with a cloak that is black trimmed with gold. And on her belt gleamed an intricate transmutation sigil—a mark of her mastery.
Eddie stared, a strange mix of pride and disbelief welling in his chest. How easy it was to forget, amid her dry wit and peculiar humour, that Catherine was more than his aunt. She was a legend. Catherine the Elf is an innovator whose name appeared in nearly every codex and alchemical manuscript worth reading. To the world, she was a Master Alchemist, one of the greatest minds alive.
The silence of the hall pressed in on him. Eddie exhaled slowly, feeling the enormity of it all. And yet, looking at Catherine’s painted likeness, he couldn’t help but feel as though she were watching him. Expectant, but not unkind.
“Master Alchemist Catherine,” Eddie whispered to himself, his voice soft. And for a moment, it felt as though the portrait might answer.
As he entered the hall, the people beside him were not what he’d expected. No one was near his age—in fact, the closest seemed to be in their early thirties. One woman, wrapped in deep emerald robes, looked every inch like a seasoned sorceress. Beside her sat a bearded man flipping through a well-worn alchemical tome. Experience and patience etched his face. Another candidate, an older woman with silver-streaked hair, held a staff on her lap, its gemstone glowing faintly as though it had a life of its own. Each one radiated an air of experience and competence, and Eddie felt his stomach twist.
He fidgeted with the strap of his satchel. His fingers grazed the notes from Catherine’s lessons. As though the feel of the parchment could give him some courage. Was he really in the right place?
He double-checked Emma’s letter. The crisp parchment clutched tightly in his hand as he read over her simple instructions for the day. And the receptionist had told him to come here, hadn’t she? Still, a creeping sense of doubt slipped in as he glanced again at his neighbours. They seemed leagues ahead of him, their eyes calm and calculating, a sharp contrast to the quiet storm brewing inside him.
He took a deep breath, steadying himself. Catherine’s voice echoed in his mind: “Alchemy isn’t easy, but it will bend to the determined.”
With that thought, Eddie forced himself to sit up straighter, squaring his shoulders.
The door to the exam room swung open, and Eddie’s eyes widened as Emma Somers stepped out. She looked as intimidating as ever. Her sharp gaze scanned the waiting area before settling on him, her expression unreadable. She walked over briskly, her gaze piercing through his nervousness.
“Ah, Mr Welton,” she said in a tone that held both appraisal and challenge. “So you’ve come.”
Eddie took a deep breath, willing himself to keep steady. “I did. I decided from the start.”
A hint of approval flickered in her eyes, and she nodded. “Good. I wish you luck, then. This examination may prove... challenging. The professors here consider it one of the harder assessments.”
“I’ve prepared,“ Eddie replied, determined to sound more confident than he felt.
But a booming voice rang through the examination hall, echoing off the stone walls.
“Attention all candidates. The Intermediate Alchemist Proficiency Examination will begin in one minute. Proceed to the designated testing area.“
Eddie’s stomach dropped. Intermediate Alchemist Proficiency Examination? His heart pounded as he looked around at the other candidates. Who barely reacted, already looking seasoned and ready. It hit him with sickening clarity. Emma hadn’t registered him for the entrance exam. She had signed him up for an Intermediate Proficiency test meant for those with experience and skill well beyond his.
A cold sweat prickled his forehead as he turned to Emma, searching her face for any sign of a mistake. But her expression was calm, composed, as if this had been the plan all along.
“Mrs Somers, I... I thought...“ His words caught in his throat.
She raised an eyebrow. “I assumed you’d prefer a genuine challenge, Mr Welton. You came here to prove yourself, did you not?“
Eddie’s mouth was dry, his thoughts racing. Catherine’s lessons flashed before his eyes, every scrap of paper he’d pored over in the dead of night. Was he ready? He forced himself to swallow, the determination flickering under his shock.
Eddie leaned in, his voice a tense whisper brimming with frustration. “This is a test for Intermediate Alchemists, not a basic entrance exam for Bachelor’s.”
Emma’s eyes barely flickered. “You’d be correct,“ she replied coolly.
“It’s unfair!“ he hissed, struggling to keep his voice low. “I came here to take the entrance exam for the Bachelor of Alchemy, not—whatever this is!“
Emma’s gaze hardened, her voice quiet but unyielding. “You walked into this institute with connections, Mr Welton. Unfair advantages are rarely without their price.“ Her lips curled in a faint, knowing smile. “This should be a walk in the park for the student of the renowned Master Alchemist, Catherine the Elf. I wish you the best of luck.”
Before he could respond, she turned on her heel. Leaving him standing there, his mouth half-open in protest.
Eddie cursed under his breath, his fingers tightening into fists at his sides. His suspicions had been correct. He glanced around the room and saw it clearly now—something was off. The other candidates weren’t wide-eyed, hopeful, or anxious like him. No, they were calm and collected. Experienced. Some even wore faint smirks, like they already knew what test they’d face.
It hit him all at once.
This wasn’t just an entrance exam. This was something far more advanced. And the bitter taste of betrayal settled in his chest as he finally understood.
The announcer’s voice boomed across the hall, cutting through his thoughts.
“Welcome, candidates, to the Intermediate Alchemist Proficiency Examination.”
Eddie froze, his blood running cold. So that was it. The truth. He wasn’t just here to prove he belonged in the Institute. He was here to prove himself as an Intermediate Alchemist. This was no entrance exam. No, Emma wasn’t testing Eddie—she was challenging him.
His heart began to race. His palms felt clammy. He was in the deep end now, and there was no turning back.
He glanced at the candidates again. Their eyes held a mix of confidence and subtle challenge, and Eddie knew—he wasn’t just competing for a spot. He was fighting to stay in the game.
The announcer’s voice rang out across the hall again, steady and commanding. Eddie turned his attention to the podium. A neatly dressed elderly man stood in red robes that spoke of years of expertise. And of a life dedicated to alchemy. His face, while grizzled with age, carried an air of efficiency. The kind one might expect from someone who’d spent decades in a lab, turning base metals into something more. His eyes twinkled with the quiet authority of someone who had seen it all.
“Candidates,“ the announcer began. His voice echoed in the silence, “Welcome to the Intermediate Alchemist Proficiency Examination. The task before you is simple but no less challenging—turn Lead into Gold.“
A murmur rippled through the room as the statement’s weight hit the candidates. The task was one of the oldest, most coveted alchemical feats. The transmutation of base metal into precious gold. Eddie’s heart skipped a beat. That was… no small feat.
“You have until the evening to complete this task,“ the announcer continued. “We assigned each of you a desk equipped with the basic tools and materials.” Use them wisely. You may begin when you are ready.“
Eddie’s eyes flitted around the room. Sure enough, desks lined the walls, each outfitted with various alchemical tools. Glass beakers, stirring rods, copper cauldrons, and crucibles. A few desks even had small bundles of lead sitting at their centres, waiting to be transformed. It was a simple setup, but that only made it more intimidating. The tools at his disposal were nothing fancy—just the basic necessities for an alchemist. And yet, in this moment, they felt like the key to his success or the instrument of his failure.
The announcer’s voice broke through his thoughts. “Good luck to all of you. The clock starts now. Please proceed to your desks and begin your work.”
Eddie took a deep breath. There was no turning back now. He straightened up, his muscles tight with anticipation, and made his way to the desk in the far corner of the room. As he approached, he couldn’t help but glance at the other candidates. Each moved with quiet confidence, their hands already reaching for their tools. They weren’t just here to pass—they were here to succeed, to prove their mastery.
His heart pounded harder in his chest. But he wasn’t about to back down. This was his moment. He had come this far and wouldn’t let fear dictate his actions. Taking his place at the desk, Eddie carefully set down his materials, his hands steady despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins.
o-
Eddie sat at his desk, his elbows propped on the icy surface, staring down at the tools before him. The nameplate before him read “Edward Welton“ as if to remind him who he was—and what he was supposed to be capable of. But right now, Eddie didn’t feel like an alchemist. He felt like a fraud.
Two hours had passed since the test began, despite that, he hadn’t lifted a single tool. His fingers hovered just above the alchemical instruments. Flasks, tongs, and glass vials—but his hands refused to make a move. Instead, they rubbed at his messy silver hair in frustration, tugging at strands that had already begun to fall in front of his eyes. The task in front of him—a simple enough request, at least in words: turn lead into gold—was anything but simple.
Eddie had read every codex Catherine had shoved at him. Every scroll, tome, and crumbling parchment detailing such a feat’s impossibility. The transmutation of base metals into gold was a legend. A metaphor—something to be aspired to but never achieved. The very foundation of alchemy was based on the understanding that this was not possible. The laws of nature couldn’t be bent that far. The balance of the world wouldn’t allow it.
But here he was, sitting at his desk. Surrounded by seasoned alchemists and magicians who, like him, had seen these truths. Eddie wasn’t some fool. He knew what the job entailed. He knew what they were asking. He’d seen what it took to even begin to grasp the basic principles of alchemy. And he was damn sure that turning lead into gold was no more possible than flying by flapping your arms.
Yet, as Eddie glanced around the room. At the others already bent over their tasks with calm, deliberate focus, he couldn’t help but feel the crushing weight of doubt. Were they pretending? Or was he the one who had missed something?
A sick knot twisted in his stomach. His gaze flicked back to the lead on his desk, the dull, grey metal sitting there as if mocking him. “Lead into gold,“ he muttered, his voice strained. The thought of trying to make this happen felt like trying to fight a bear with a toothpick. Impossible. And the more he thought about it, the more absurd it all seemed. He could already hear Emma’s smug tone as she threw him into this test, watching him flounder. She knew this was a lost cause. She had to.
“Fuck,“ Eddie cursed, grinding his teeth. His eyes stung with frustration. How am I supposed to do this? Catherine never prepared him for this kind of nonsense. She’d taught him the fundamentals. The transformation of one material to another, the study of the elements, the intricate steps of the alchemical process—but this? This wasn’t alchemy. This was some ridiculous, idealistic dream that didn’t even belong in a classroom.
The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He had been dragged into this mess, thinking it was the entrance exam he had prepared for. Instead, he was being asked to do the impossible. Turn lead into gold.
The more Eddie wrestled with the task, the clearer it became: this wasn’t about alchemy. It was about something else—a test of his resolve, a challenge designed to make him confront his limitations. To see how far he’d go when faced with the impossible. And for all his studies and preparation, Eddie wasn’t sure if he was ready to face this kind of challenge. He had always believed in the rational, the attainable. Now? He was standing at the edge of a cliff.
“You’re asking me to fight a bear with a toothpick at this point, Somers,“ he muttered bitterly, his hands gripping the edge of the desk. He was at a crossroads, and it was dawning on him that no amount of knowledge could help him now.
It was all or nothing. </Text>

            <Text>Eddie trudged down the stairs, rubbing the grogginess from his face. The scent of fish soup still clung to the air, though it had long since cooled. As he descended, the creaking steps announced his arrival before he even reached the bottom.
Torrie was already waiting for him. She sat on the couch, legs swinging slightly, her satchel tucked neatly by her side. Her uniform—crisp and freshly pressed—was complete with the wide-brimmed hat perched atop her head. She looked ready to march straight into her first lesson.
Her large round glasses caught the morning light as she turned to face him.
&quot;You overslept again,” she said, crossing her arms.
Eddie scoffed, running a hand through his silver hair. “It’s called resting, actually. Pretty important, y'know. Keeps you from turning into a ghoul.”
Torrie eyed him. “You did remember you were supposed to take me to Aella, right?”
Eddie hesitated just long enough for her smirk to widen.
“Oh my gods,” she groaned dramatically, leaning her head back. “You forgot.”
“Hey, hey, I didn’t forget!” Eddie protested, pointing a finger at her. “I just… temporarily misplaced that piece of information.”
“That’s forgetting.”
Eddie clicked his tongue. “Debatable.”
Torrie shook her head, exasperated but amused. &quot;You’re the worst.&quot;
&quot;And yet,&quot; Eddie shot back, standing up and stretching, &quot;here I am, awake and ready to escort you like the responsible older brother that I am.&quot;
Torrie squinted at him. &quot;Barely.&quot;
Eddie ruffled her hair on the way to grab his satchel, ignoring her protests as she batted his hand away. &quot;C’mon, let’s go before Mum decides to hex me into a broom and fly you there herself.&quot;
The garage was old—probably older than Eddie himself. The wooden beams sagged slightly, and the scent of oil, damp wood, and rust lingered in the air. Dusty sunlight filtered through the gaps in the planks, casting streaks of gold across the scattered tools and forgotten crates.
In the middle of it all stood Eddie’s bike.
It was an ancient, clunky thing—red paint chipped at the edges, the metal frame scuffed from years of use. It had once belonged to his father, and before that, he wouldn’t be surprised if his grandfather had ridden it through these very streets. A relic of the Welton family, barely held together by years of hasty repairs and just enough luck.
Eddie tightened the straps on the back, securing both their satchels before giving the bike a few testing bounces. It creaked but held firm.
Torrie stood nearby, hands behind her back, watching as he worked. “Do you ever clean this thing?”
Eddie scoffed. “It’s got character.”
“It’s got rust.”
“Character and rust,” he corrected, checking the pedals. “That’s what gives it charm.”
As Eddie adjusted the handlebars, he glanced over at her. “So, you thought about what you wanna do for your magical concentration yet?”
Torrie scrunched up her nose. “I just got into Aella, Ed. I’ve got plenty of time to figure that out.”
“You say that now,” Eddie smirked, “And one day, boom, second year sneaks up on you, and suddenly you have to choose whether you wanna be an Alchemist, an Illusionist, a Conjurer, or whatever fancy new stuff they’ve added since my time.”
Torrie shrugged. “Right now, I just wanna make friends, get to know the teachers. No rush.”
As Eddie adjusted the straps on their satchels, Torrie swung her legs idly and tilted her head. “So… are the teachers at Aella really as strict as Mom says?”
Eddie snorted. “Some of them? Absolutely.” He straightened up and leaned against the bike. 
“Take Mrs. Neira” Eddie began, “She teaches Runes. And she teaches that class with an Iron Fist. She’s the kind of teacher who can spot an untucked shirt from fifty paces.”
Torrie groaned. “Great. That sounds fantastic.”
“Oh, and don’t even think about dozing off in her class,” Eddie added. “She once hexed my notes into paper rabbits and hopped away mid-lecture because I didn’t pay attention.”
Torrie’s eyes widened. “You’re joking.”
“Wish I was.”
She slumped dramatically against the wooden railing. “This is already sounding so fun.”
“Well, not all the teachers are terrifying.” Eddie grinned. “Mr. Ferie’s the exact opposite. He teaches Alchemy, and he’s probably the most laid-back teacher at Aella. You’ll like him.”
Torrie perked up. “Why? What’s he like?”
“Well, for one, he actually likes students,” Eddie said, tightening a bolt. “And he’s big on competitions—he’s always picking out students to send to alchemy tournaments. I think he just enjoys the chaos of it all.”
Torrie chuckled. “Sounds like someone I’d actually want to take a class with.”
“Oh, you will,” Eddie smirked as he stood up. “And when you do, tell him I send my regards, and….”
Torrie narrowed her eyes. “…And?”
“And that his socks smell.”
“You’re terrible!” Torrie burst into laughter, “I’m not telling that on my first day!”
Eddie shrugged, grinning. “He’ll know what it means.”
Still giggling, Torrie shook her head as Eddie made the final check. Satisfied, he strode over to the garage door and grabbed the handle. With a heave, he pushed it open.
Light poured in, golden and fresh, chasing away the dust and shadows. Outside, the streets of Weshaven beckoned—cobbled roads damp from morning mist, lined with wooden houses that leaned ever so slightly from the years. The sea breeze carried the scent of salt and fish, mixing with the distant chatter of merchants setting up their stalls.
Eddie swung a leg over the bike, glancing back at Torrie. “Alright, You ready?”
Torrie adjusted her hat, eyes bright. “Ready.”
And with that, they rode off, the old bike rattling down the street as the Welton siblings made their way through the waking town.

-o-

The town of Weshaven stirred to life as Eddie and Torrie rolled down the sloping streets, the crisp morning air tinged with the scent of brine and freshly caught fish. The narrow roads twisted and wove between clustered stone-and-timber houses, their rooftops slick with morning dew.
Below them, the harbor sprawled like a great wooden beast, its docks lined with fishing boats bobbing gently in the tide. The air thrummed with the sounds of the morning commute—sailors calling out as they hauled in nets from the previous night’s catch, shipwrights hammering away at weather-worn hulls, and merchants rolling out their stalls, their carts stacked with exotic wares from distant shores.
Eddie steered carefully as they gained momentum, their satchels bouncing slightly against the back of the bike. The road sloped steeply ahead, the cobblestones uneven in places, but he knew this path like the back of his hand. He kept one foot ready on the brake, just in case.
The street curved, and the town slowly unfurled before them—a lively, salt-kissed pocket of the world, waking up to another day.
Further ahead, moving steadily against the flow of early-morning foot traffic, a broad-shouldered figure in a worn flat cap trudged up the pavement. 
His thick brown curls peeked from beneath the cap, and he carried himself with an easy, unhurried gait despite the weight of the heavy satchel slung over his shoulder. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing arms dusted with faint stains—herbs, ink, or maybe soot from the apothecary’s furnace.
Torrie, perched behind Eddie, squinted as they neared. Then, with a small gasp, she nudged Eddie’s shoulder. “Isn’t that Markus?”
Eddie followed her gaze. Sure enough, it was Markus, making his way toward the apothecary, likely just coming off a delivery run.
With a grin, Eddie squeezed the brakes, slowing the bike as they rolled up beside him. “Oi, Markus! You heading back already?”
Markus glanced up, his tired but good-natured expression shifting into a small smile. “Morning, you two.” His voice was soft, polite as ever. “Making a stop before opening up.”
“I’m clocking in late today,” Eddie admitted, adjusting his grip on the handlebars. “Gotta take Torrie to school first.”
Markus raised his brows, impressed. “That so? What academy are you off to, then?”
Torrie straightened in her seat, her face glowing with pride. “Aella Academy!”
Markus let out an approving hum. “That’s a fine place. You’ll do well there.” Then he glanced toward the harbor. “Ferry leaves in an hour. You two best get going.”
“Yeah, we should,” Eddie agreed, nudging the bike forward. “See you later, Markus!”
“Take care,” Markus said with a small wave.
With that, Eddie and Torrie pushed off, rolling down the street once more, weaving through the waking town.
Eddie gritted his teeth as he steered through the crowded streets, weaving between fishermen hauling in their morning catch, merchants haggling over crates of imported goods, and dockhands rolling barrels toward waiting ships. The salty breeze carried the scent of fish and brine, mingling with the shouts of sailors calling orders across the bustling Bright Harbour.
The ferry was leaving in an hour—but at this rate, it might as well be five minutes.
&quot;Come on, come on,&quot; Eddie muttered, scanning for a gap in the throng.
Torrie clung tightly to his waist. &quot;We’re not gonna make it!&quot;
&quot;Yes, we are,&quot; Eddie shot back, his eyes locking onto an opening between a pair of arguing traders. He hit the pedals hard, propelling the bike forward, skimming past them with barely an inch to spare.
The dock came into view. A bell rang—final boarding call.
With a final burst of speed, Eddie rode up the wooden planks, skidding to a halt just as a deckhand moved to pull up the gangway.
&quot;Two for Osthaven!&quot; Eddie panted.
The deckhand raised an eyebrow but waved them on. Eddie and Torrie scrambled aboard, collapsing onto one of the wooden benches as the ferry gave a low horn and lurched away from the dock.
Torrie exhaled, catching her breath. &quot;That was close.&quot;
Eddie wiped his brow with a grin. &quot;Told you we'd make it.&quot;
&quot;You had to make it,&quot; she teased, nudging him. &quot;You can’t miss the ferry, especially on my first day!&quot;
Eddie chuckled, leaning back against the bench, feeling the weight of the rush fade as the ferry rocked gently with the waves. His eyes drifted out to the horizon, where the sea stretched endlessly toward the east.
Osthaven.
It had been a while since he set foot there.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5.5</Title>
            <Text>
Eddie sat at his desk in the corner of Dormitory 7, shoulders hunched over a thick Alchemical textbook. The diagrams sprawled across the page in tight, looping script, encrypted formulas showing the delicate thresholds between copper and verdigris, gas and flame, matter and memory. Notes were scrawled in his own handwriting along the margins. The desk lamp hummed faintly, casting sharp shadows that danced with every flick of his pen.
He didn’t hear the guitar at first—barely registered the sound amid the quiet storm of his concentration. Will was on the bottom bunk, leaning against the bedframe, head bobbing slightly as he coaxed soft scales out of his guitar. Each note plucked from the strings glowed faintly in the air, trailing runes that pulsed and faded like sparks drifting on water.
The room was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the bunk frame, the gentle thrum of guitar strings, and the scratch of Eddie’s pen as he annotated a particularly difficult transfiguration formula.
He didn’t notice the sound of footsteps approaching.Didn’t register the hurried knock.Didn’t hear the door swing open.
&quot;Ashley?&quot; Will said, glancing up.
Ashley stood in the doorway, slightly breathless. Her eyes went straight to Eddie.“You’ve got a call,” she said. “It’s Madeleine. On the hall phone.”
Eddie looked up, blinking as if surfacing from underwater.“A call?” he repeated. “Now?”
Will grinned. “Oho, the mystery deepens. She finally cracked and confessed her undying—”
But Ashley didn’t laugh. She didn’t roll her eyes or shove him in the shoulder like she usually would.She just said, quietly, urgently, “Eddie. You need to come. Now.”
Eddie was already out of his chair.
Eddie jogged down the corridor, bare footsteps thudding against rough floorboards. The dorm hallway was mostly quiet—just the faint hum of lanterns and a distant laugh from someone two floors down. He rounded the corner and spotted the wall-mounted phone at the end of the corridor, its receiver swinging like a pendulum from the base.
His heart kicked up.
He grabbed it mid-swing. “Hello?”
There was a sharp breath of relief on the other end.“Eddie. It’s me.”
“Madeleine?” His back straightened. “Are you okay? You sound—”
“Listen,” she cut in, voice taut and quick, like a pulled string. “I don’t have time to explain. I need you. I need all of you—Will, Ashley, everyone—at the library. Tonight.”
Eddie blinked. “Wait, what’s happened? What’s going on?”
“It’s—” Her voice cut out for a second. A faint crackle distorted the line. “It’s Professor Hudson. I think he knows—”
Bzzzt.
A loud burst of static screamed through the receiver. Eddie yanked it away from his ear, flinching.
“Madeleine?” he called into the noise, trying the hook. “Hello? Madeleine?”
Silence. Then a low mechanical whir. Then nothing at all.
He glanced back down the hall as if expecting Ashley to still be there. “Come on…”
Suddenly—Click.
“Hello?” he tried again, breath held.
A gasp. “E-Eddie!”
He gripped the receiver tighter. “Madeleine, what’s happening?”
“I think someone’s following me.”
His stomach dropped. “Where are you?”
There was a pause. A rustle. Then, distantly: the creak of a booth door opening. Her voice dropped to a whisper.“I’m at my apartment. Just past the old fence. Near the east ward sign. There’s someone—he’s not moving, but—”
The line cracked again.
“I’ve got my wand—he’s coming closer—Eddie, I—”
Pop.
The line went dead.
Eddie stood there, frozen, the soft dial tone humming against his ear like a dirge.
Slowly, he lowered the receiver.
He turned.
Will and Ashley were already there at the end of the corridor. Ashley’s face was pale, tense—she’d heard enough to know. But it was Will’s expression that struck Eddie now: no smirk, no joke, just quiet alarm setting into his features like a stormcloud.
Eddie’s eyes met theirs. A flicker. A pause. A breathless moment where nothing needed to be said.
We’ve got to do something.
Ashley gave a sharp nod. Will was already moving.
They grabbed their jackets from the hooks near the dorm stairs, Will slinging his guitar bag over his shoulder out of instinct. No time to ask why. No time to prepare. Only the urgency in Eddie’s blood and the fading echo of Madeleine’s voice in his ear.
Then they stormed out into the night.
Through the arching gates of the dormitory. Across the frost-hushed campus. Their breath rose in quick clouds as they ran—past silent halls, over cobbled paths slick with dew, the gaslamps stretching their shadows long and fast.
Toward Aetherell Reach.
Toward her.</Text>
            <Notes>On this Chapter when the POV goes back to Eddie,

Eddie should also be finding a clue too, in fact he should be the one getting the clues Harder

There will be Conflict with Victoria as Eddie is caught trying to get informations about the Political Organisations in Edenfield. Which is strictly forbidden by the Student Council, and that Students are not allowed to join the local political groups, they are only allowed to join university ones


At the end on Eddie’s persuit, Eddie stumbles upon Will and Ashley, who then goes after him together with the Student Council

Eddie might be caught sneaking up to the Professors Office at night sneaking up to Professor Hudson’s files</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 3E V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stepped through the gate, and the moment his foot crossed the threshold, the air changed. It was warmer here, lighter. He could hear the rustle of grass underfoot, the creaking of wood in the distance, and the soft grunts and murmurs of things—living things—all around him.
He followed close behind Madeleine, taking in the view.
The sheer scale of the place stopped him in his tracks.
Compared to the Book Pirates' so-called “headquarters”—a musty, booze-stained basement barely large enough for a table and mismatched chairs—this was… acres. Fences crisscrossed the landscape, separating fields and paddocks, with stone paths winding between tall grass and wildflowers. Some cabins stood off to the side, their moss-covered roofs blending with the landscape, while distant sheds and enclosures dotted the horizon like watchful outposts.
And the creatures.
There were creatures everywhere.
A herd of something deer-like but scaled grazed lazily near the fence. Bright-feathered bird-beasts perched on low posts, ruffling their wings with annoyed chirps. A furry, long-legged animal with too many eyes blinked up at Eddie from behind a fence and then went back to chewing on a branch.
“This is the front range,” Madeleine said, her tone casual but proud. “We keep the gentler ones closer to the gate. Rescue gryphlings, retired hippogriffs, a few centaur folk who don’t mind being neighbors.”
Eddie’s eyes wandered further out, where the landscape dipped into shadowy groves and distant enclosures. “And the dragons?”
“Back there,” she said, nodding toward the tree line in the far distance. “We keep the more aggressive or high-risk creatures farther out—dragons, manticores, anything that breathes fire or bites through steel.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “And that’s where you want to take me?”
She nodded. “Eventually, yes.”
Eddie gave a skeptical chuckle, leaning slightly on his crutch. “Because nothing says recovery like a stroll through the fire-breathing death animals.”
Madeleine laughed. “You haven’t even met one of the cute fire-breathing animals yet.”
Eddie blinked. “I’m sorry, did you just put ‘cute’ and ‘fire-breathing’ in the same sentence?”
She grinned. “You’ll see.”
Eddie looked out over the Sanctuary again. Even from here, he could see the faint shimmer of heat waves rising from the far end, where the tree line thickened and the fences became taller, reinforced with wards and polished iron. Something inside him stirred—a mix of nerves, curiosity, and that same stubborn instinct that had made him board the bus in the first place.
Madeleine rolled her eyes fondly. “Before that, I need to speak to someone,” 
She led the way toward a modest stone building tucked under a slope, ivy creeping along its walls and a slanted roof sagging just slightly at the edges. A hand-painted sign above the door read: Caretaker’s Office. Eddie followed her in, the faint scent of parchment and pine oils wafting from within.
At the reception desk, instead of the usual student attendant, Madeleine nearly collided with Professor Gareth Hudson—tall, silver-haired, and impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray waistcoat, his presence as polished as the alchemy vials he carried. A harried student trailed behind him, arms stacked with ledgers titled Species Classification &amp; Behavioral Anomalies.
“Oh, I’m so sorry Professor, I was-“
“Ah, Mrs. Daedallia, not to worry,” Hudson said, his voice smooth and deliberate, like honey over steel. “A pleasure, as always.” His gaze flicked to Eddie, and a faint smile touched his lips. “Mr. Welton. States Transformation, isn’t it? I must admit, I never expected one of my own students to show such… enthusiasm for mystical fauna.” 
Eddie stiffened at the backhanded compliment but forced a grin. “Guess I’m just… expanding my horizons, Professor.”
Hudson’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “How commendable.” He turned back to Madeleine, tilting his clipboard toward her. “Now, what brings Edenfield’s finest caretaker to the administrative den? Surely not my scintillating company.”
Madeleine’s fingers twitched toward the empty keyhook behind the desk. “I need access to the Back Range. For a tour.”
“A tour?” Hudson’s eyebrow arched. “With this one?” He gestured to Eddie’s crutch, his tone light but edged with skepticism. “The Back Range is no place for convalescents. Unless”—his voice dropped, almost playful—“you’ve discovered a therapeutic application for wyvern venom I haven’t?”
The student behind him stifled a nervous laugh. Madeleine’s jaw tightened.
Hudson tapped his clipboard with a gloved finger. “Fortunately for you, I’ve just finished compiling data from the Back Range.” He gestured to the student behind him, who hurried to place the ledgers on the desk. “Though I’d advise against lingering for too long.” His gaze lingered on Eddie’s crutch. “Predators do so love uneven footing.”
Madeleine ignored the jab. “We’ll manage.”
“I’m sure you will.” Hudson’s smile was razor-thin. “Mr. Jones has the key. Do remember to return it.” He paused, as if struck by a thought. “Ah, and Madeleine? The Student Council’s new security memo applies to all staff. Even you.”
Hudson smiled—polite, practiced, and utterly unreadable. “Excellent. I’d hate for your enthusiasm to be… misconstrued.” He adjusted his cuffs, then gestured to the waiting student. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, these reports won’t transcribe themselves.”
As he turned to leave, he paused, as if struck by an afterthought. “Oh, and Madeleine?” He didn’t look back. “Do give my regards to the Alamirian tiger. She’s had quite the appetite lately.”
Then he was gone, the sound of his polished shoes fading down the hall, leaving behind the faint scent of bergamot and something sharper—ozone, maybe, or the ghost of an alchemical reaction.
At the reception desk, a student leaned back in a worn leather chair, on the table there is a name tag Hughes Jones. He is flipping through a thick ledger with one hand and munching on something out of a paper bag with the other. He looked up as they entered.
“Hey Hughes,” Madeleine greeted, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Who was in charge of the gates today?”
Hughes—tall, freckled, popped the rest of his snack into his mouth and replied around a chew. “Victor. Why?”
Madeleine’s brows furrowed. “Then why were the gates closed? It’s not past hours yet.”
Hughes shrugged, “As you heard from Professor Hudson,” he said as he flipped the ledger around lazily. “Security reasons.”
Madeleine blinked, clearly offended. “What security? We already have three layers. There’s the perimeter fences, the Illusory Gate, and the fact that the entire Sanctuary is surrounded by a cloaked forest. Nothing gets in or out without going through the gate. You know that right?”
Hughes sighed like he’d been waiting for this part. “Look, I just follow the memo, alright. Got word from the Student Council folks that we needed to re-evaluate the Sanctuary’s security measures. Something about recent creature attacks near campus.” He held up a crumpled newspaper. “They’re calling it a warning. If we don’t comply, they’ll start pulling campus support.”
“That’s ridiculous,” Madeleine snapped, eyes narrowing. “We’ve done a full count. There’s nothing missing, nothing added. Every species is accounted for.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Hughes said, shrugging again. “If the Student Council says jump, I ask how high. I don’t make the rules, Madeleine.”
Madeleine, more composed now, held out her hand. “Fine. Just give me the key to the Back Range. I’m giving my friend a tour.”
Hughes hesitated a beat, then opened a drawer and slid out a slender iron key. “Here,” he said, but gave Eddie a pointed look. “Just… be careful, alright? Last thing I need is a second ‘incident report’ because someone wandered into a wyvern nest with a limp.”
Eddie raised a brow. “Oi, you guys talking about me?” he said, in mock offense. “Because I thrive in wyvern-infested terrain, thank you very much.”
Madeleine smirked but didn’t linger. “Thanks, Hughes,” she said, snatching the key before turning on her heel. “Come on.”
Eddie followed her out, crutch thudding softly against the wooden floor as the door creaked shut behind them. Sunlight filtered through the trees again as they stepped onto the winding dirt path toward the Back Range, the air cooler, quieter, and oddly charged—like something was waiting just ahead.

-o-

As Eddie and Madeleine walked deeper into the Sanctuary, the mood began to shift. Near the front, sunlight still touched the fences and grassy paths, where Sanctuary members were leading tours for wide-eyed elementary-aged students in matching cloaks. A small group clustered near a gentle, antlered beast with scales like polished stone, giggling as it bowed to let them pet its snout.
Farther along, two caretakers were gently helping an older couple onto the back of a large, feathery creature. It had the wide, watchful eyes of an owl, a powerful bear-like body covered in dappled down, and tucked at its sides—massive, elegant wings folded like cloaks. The creature gave a low, soothing hoot as it crouched to let the riders on, its claws curling into the grass with surprising care.
It moved with the softness of snowfall, each step deliberate, like it was trying not to startle the breeze.
Madeleine nudged him. “Not a nightmare after all, hm?”
“Yeah, I guess so.” Eddie said, but his eyes stayed on the retreating wings. “But I didn’t think Professor Hudson for the type to volunteer here,” he said abruptly. “That man acts like he’d sanitize his hands after petting a dog.”
Madeleine’s smile softened. She plucked a stray feather from the fence and twirled it between her fingers. “He’s head of the Sanctuary’s research program. Has been for years.” Her voice was measured, the way she explained things to spooked animals—gentle but firm. 
“His connections at the university and the Alchemy Ingredients Warehouse keep our supplies stocked.” She continued, “Without him, half the creatures here wouldn’t get their specialized tonics in time.”
Eddie snorted. “Yeah, but does he actually like them? Or are they just… test tubes with fur?”
She laughed, tossing the feather into the breeze. “I took his Botanical Alchemy course this year. He’s… meticulous. But people aren’t just one thing, Edward.” A pause, her gaze drifting toward the Back Range. “The man who lectures on ‘precision over passion’ also hand-feeds sugar cubes to the hippogriffs when he thinks no one’s looking.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “You’re telling me Professor Hudson has a soft side?”
“I’m telling you,” she said, turning to lead him down the path, “that even the prickliest people can surprise you.”
As they walked deeper into the sanctuary, the cheerful sounds began to fade, replaced by the hush of thickening woods. The trees here grew denser, the canopy forming a living roof that swallowed the sun. The air turned cooler, stiller, and more humid. Eddie noticed the path narrowing as vines and moss crept along the edges, and the sound of their footfalls became muffled on the leafy ground.
Madeleine glanced back at him. “This is part of the containment,” she said. “The trees are grown close on purpose—enchanted and cultivated this way. Nothing with wings can take off easily in here.”
Eddie blinked. “A forest as a cage.”
“A forest as a net,” Madeleine corrected gently. “A soft one. The creatures don’t feel trapped, but it keeps everyone safe.”
They finally stepped into the Back Range, marked by a simple wooden arch wrapped in glowing vines. The shadows here were thick, and the only light came from hanging lanterns and fruits that glowed softly like moonlight—violet, blue, and faintly golden.
Many of the enclosures were hidden by dark fabrics or veils of moss. Muffled growls and low, thudding breaths rumbled from behind them, unseen but deeply felt. One enclosure bore claw marks on the bark of the trees surrounding it, but no sign of the creature inside.
Madeleine’s expression grew somber. “These ones are all recovering,” she said softly. “Most of them were pulled from military use. Trained, abused, pushed past their limits. They weren’t made for war—but they were used like weapons.”
Eddie looked around, his gaze flicking from veil to lantern to the faint glow of eyes peering through a curtain of vines. “So they’re injured?”
“Body and spirit,” she said. “Some are still too aggressive to be handled. Others…” She paused. “Others just need someone to sit near them and remind them they’re not tools.”
The silence that followed was heavier than before. Around them, the woods seemed to watch.
And as they moved forward, Eddie began to see more of the creatures—strange, otherworldly, and awe-inspiring. A towering quadruped with armor-like plates over its shoulders huffed in its sleep. A translucent, almost ghostly winged cat with double pupils crept along the high branches. A half-curled serpent with burning red eyes followed them with its gaze from behind a thick enchanted net.
Eddie gripped his crutch tighter. “Remind me again why we’re walking towards the terrifying creatures?”
Madeleine smirked. “Because you need to see one of them.”
She led Eddie off the path, up a wooden ramp that creaked under their feet, toward one of the enclosed indoor glass sanctuaries tucked between the thick roots of the forest. The structure was built into the trees, its windows fogged and dark, blending into the woodland like a secret hidden in plain sight.
Inside, the light dimmed. The sanctuary enclosure was cloaked in heavy shadow, its interior a terrain of sand, rock, and thick branches stacked like ribs. The plaque on the glass read in precise lettering:
South Alamirian Tiger – Panthera AlamarisFemale. Estimated Age: 7. Confiscated from illegal exotic circus. High reactivity. Do not tap on enclosure.
Eddie shifted his weight onto his crutch and looked around. “Right. So… what exactly am I supposed to see?”
“Keep your voice down,” Madeleine murmured, already crouching near a sack on the side. She reached inside and pulled out a thick slab of meat wrapped in brown cloth. With practiced hands, she unraveled it and picked up a feeding stick—a long rod with a clamp at the end—and gently stabbed the meat.
Eddie was about to ask another question when he heard it.
A low, reverberating growl rolled through the enclosure like a slow thunder. He stiffened.
Madeleine didn’t flinch. She simply walked forward and held the rod out, her voice suddenly soft and coaxing. “Here, girl,” she said, like she was trying to tempt a housecat out from under a couch.
A blur of motion. Something large and lean lunged from the shadows—and in a blink, the meat was gone. Snatched mid-air with a sickening crunch. The rod quivered slightly in Madeleine’s hand.
Then it stepped into view.
Eddie’s breath caught in his throat.
The creature was tall—taller than any normal big cat he’d ever seen. Its body was thin, almost gaunt, but taut with power. A desert-colored coat stretched over sharp muscles, broken only by black stripes like brushstrokes. Its eyes glowed amber in the gloom, wild and intelligent. It prowled low, its massive paws silent against the rock, its tail twitching.
But it wasn’t the size that struck Eddie dumb.
It was the familiarity.
He knew this shape. The lean torso. The long arms. The face—feral but almost knowing.
This was it.
It was the same silhouette that had lunged at him through the firelight back on campus. Except… not quite. This one was unmistakably an animal. Its movements were feline, graceful, natural. Not like the twisted, upright thing that had ambushed him.
Madeleine, still holding the rod, glanced at Eddie and smiled gently. “She’s a South Alamirian Tiger,” she said, her voice tinged with affection. “Hails from the furthest end of the Alamirian Dunes. Not many left in the wild. This one was taken from a traveling circus in the Northern Markets. Starved, overworked, shackled since she was a cub. She barely knew how to use her claws when they brought her in.”
Her eyes sparkled now—pride, defiance, maybe even joy—as she spoke. “She’s the only one we have in the Sanctuary. Took months before she would even let us stand this close. Now she eats from the stick. One day I’m hoping she’ll come right to my hand.”
Eddie didn’t answer right away. He was still watching the tiger, who now licked the blood off her paw with slow, deliberate motions.
Madeleine’s grip tightened on the feeding rod. “Is this what attacked you?”
Eddie shook his head. “No. Not exactly.”
“But it’s close?” Her voice was taut, like a wire about to snap.
“Same claws. Same eyes. Same way it moves—” Eddie’s hands flexed at his sides, as if trying to sculpt the memory out of the air. “But the thing that came at me stood upright. Two legs, like a person. Except…” He shuddered. “It wasn’t pretending to be human. It was like… something had forced it into the shape of one.”
Madeleine went very still. Then, with deliberate slowness, she set the rod down and pulled a small notebook from her pocket. The pages fluttered as she flipped to a blank sheet, her pencil already moving. “Show me,” she said, her tone calm but edged. “Start with the silhouette.”
Eddie leaned in. “Taller than me. Thin, but not starved—wiry.” He watched her sketch the rough outline: a hunched spine, elongated limbs. “Shoulders more… here,” he corrected, tapping the page. Madeleine adjusted the lines without a word.
“The face?” she prompted.
“Feline. But the jaw was wrong—broader.” His finger slashed across the sketch.
Madeleine’s pencil froze. A drop of sweat slid down her temple. “Did it have hands?”
“Not—not quite. The fingers were fused halfway. Like it got stuck mid-change.”
Her pencil snapped. She didn’t seem to notice. The sketch was taking shape now: a grotesque fusion of tiger and man, its posture twisted as if its bones had been broken and reset wrong.
Eddie’s stomach turned. “Yeah. That’s the one.”
Madeleine stared at the drawing, her breath shallow. Around them, the Sanctuary’s usual chorus of chirps and growls had gone eerily quiet, as if the creatures themselves were listening.
“That’s…” she started, then stopped, her jaw clenched. “That’s terrifying.”
Eddie stayed quiet.
“I know.”
“It’s not just that one of them were loose in Edenfield,” she went on, voice low, nearly a whisper. “It’s that I don’t want to imagine what they stitched together to make something like that.”
Eddie swallowed. The silence stretched. Only the soft, wet sound of the tiger chewing filled the air, methodical and primal.
Madeleine finally looked back at him, eyes more focused now. “We need to do something about this.”
Eddie nodded. “We should meet up with the others. At the Library. Midnight as usual.”
Madeleine blinked. Then, slowly, a small smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. She stepped forward and tapped him gently on the arm. “Next week,” she said softly. “You need to rest first.”
Eddie exhaled. He hadn't realized how tightly he’d been gripping his crutch. “Yeah… okay. Next week.”
Madeleine nodded, her expression softening. “I know someone who might be able to help,” she said quietly. “They’ve got connections with the district government—real ones, not just student council nonsense. I can let them know about our next meeting.”
Eddie looked up at her, curious. “You trust them?”
“I do,” she said, firm but calm. “They’ll be glad to help. Especially if something this dangerous is walking around Edenfield.”
Eddie nodded slowly. The silence returned, filled only by the soft crunching of the tiger eating its meal behind the glass. The weight of what they’d just discussed still lingered, but something in Madeleine’s certainty settled him a little.
Outside, the leaves rustled in the thick trees above. The tiger, finished with her meal, settled back into the shadows, vanishing like a ghost into the enclosure’s far corner.</Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 9</Title>
            <Text>The day blurred into the same dull monotony as always. Eddie filled orders for medicines and remedies, extracted ingredients, and stocked the shelves—just as he had for years. The routine never changed.
That evening, the glass front door of Welton’s Apothecary clicked shut, the chime of the bell overhead ringing softly as Eddie locked up. He let out a slow breath, stretching his shoulders.
“You’re not coming to the Swordfish Pub?” Eddie asked, glancing at Markus, who was securing the last of the wooden shutters.
“Sorry, Eddie.” Markus sighed, rolling out his shoulders. “My old man’s back has been acting up again. I need to help him out.”
“Well, alright then. Can’t be helped.” Eddie huffed but nodded. “Give Mr. Fletcher my best. If he needs anything from the Apothecary, just take it.”
Markus smiled. “Thanks, Ed, but I’ve already brewed him a custom remedy. Figured I can’t rely on you forever.”
Eddie blinked in surprise, then let out a small, approving chuckle. “Look at you, making your own remedies. That’s solid work. Tell your old man to rest up, yeah? Maybe stay off the sea for a while.”
Markus snorted. “You know that’s never happening. The sea could swallow him whole, and he’d still find a way back onto a boat.” He adjusted his satchel and gave a tired grin. “At least I can help with the back pain.”
Eddie smirked. “That’s something, at least.”
Markus clapped him on the shoulder. “See you tomorrow, Ed.”
With that, he turned and headed down the road, his silhouette vanishing into the evening fog.
Eddie watched as Markus’s silhouette grew smaller, swallowed by the dip of the road down the hill. Now, it was just him.
A sharp breeze rolled in from the sea, cutting through his clothes with its usual evening chill. The distant cries of seagulls mixed with the howling wind, carrying the scent of salt and damp wood.
Eddie sighed, shoving his hands into his pockets as he stepped onto the quiet street. The last traces of the workday lingered in the air—dim lights in shop windows, the occasional murmur of voices. But the town was winding down.
And so, alone with the cold and the fading bustle, Eddie made his way toward the pub.

-o-

The sign bearing the name Swordfish Pub swayed in the sea breeze as Eddie neared the pub, Fishermen, Merchants, and all sorts of people began to gather to cool off in the evening, including Eddie.
He opened the door, and entered the welcoming yet warm chaos within.
Wood-panelled walls adorned with fishing nets surrounds him. Mounted fish and faded nautical charts decorated its walls. Roaring fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the bustling room. A comforting wave of grilled fish and strong ale washed over him.
“Well, well, if it ain’t young Welton!” the barman greeted as Eddie approached the counter, wiping down a tankard. “Come to grace us with your vast wisdom on herbs and potions, have you?”
“More like blessing myself with a pint,” Eddie chuckled, settling onto a stool.
“The usual, then?” The barman grinned.
“You know me.” Eddie smirked.
With a practiced motion, the barman filled a tankard to the brim and slid it across the counter. “There you go.”
“Cheers, mate.” Eddie said, taking a sip.
“Hard day at the Apothecary?”
“Something like that,” Eddie muttered, setting his drink down.
The barman leaned on the counter. “You know, you can always talk to me about that kinda thing. Lightens the load. People come sit here to do that from time to time.”
Eddie snorted. “What are you, my therapist now?”
“My rates are cheaper.”
Eddie let out a laugh. “Right. I’ll be sure to book a session next time I’m in the middle of a life crisis.”
“See that you do,” The barman laughed, The barkeep chuckled, but the sound was cut short as another patron waved him over. “Duty calls. I’ll see ya later, Welton,” he said, setting the clean mug aside and heading to the other end of the bar.
Eddie was left with his drink. He stared into the amber coloured liquid for a moment. Letting the pub’s ambience fill his ears—the murmur of conversations, the occasional clink of tankards, and the crackle of the fire.
Then, his attention was caught by a voice. Its rhythm sharp and musical. But layered with an unfamiliar guttural quality. Eddie’s attention peaked; the tone familiar, though he couldn’t remember it.
Turning his seat, he looked around, scanning the room. Maybe it’s Lydia? Or someone he knows, but then, his eyes landed on a figure seated at a corner table.
The figure’s sharp, pointed ears were a dead giveaway; Eddie knew instantly who it was.
It was Catherine.
Her figure is leaning forward. Her apple-red hair caught the lantern light. Her sharp, pointed ears made a silhouette distinguishing that she is an Elf. She speaks in rapid bursts of a foreign tongue Eddie didn’t recognise. Opposite her sat three merchants, their attire adorned with intricate patterns and jewellery that marked them as travellers from distant lands. On the table between them lay a worn, yellowed map, its edges curled and frayed.
What the hell is Catherine doing here? In his usual pub? And what the hell is she doing with those merchants? Is she selling something? Buying something? Didn’t she go with his mother earlier this morning?
The scholars were speaking now, their voices hushed. Catherine’s response was fluent, her voice low and measured. Eddie could barely follow, but a few phrases in the common tongue broke through, and from Eddie’s old lesson in Alamirian language, it began to slowly be pieced together, like fragments of a puzzle:
“...the Forbidden Codex of Craemonia Bastion...”
Eddie’s curiosity flared. Quietly, he picked up his tankard and moved to a table a few feet behind her. He moves, taking care not to draw attention to himself. He leaned back, feigning a casual demeanour as he sipped his drink, his ears straining to catch the conversation.
The scholars leaned closer to Catherine, one gesturing toward the map.
“We will pay you whatever you ask,” the man said desperately, “You’re one of the remaining Elves we can contact… or ever. You are the only one who knows the entrance to their gates.”
“The codex’s rumour, if they were right,” The second scholar said, “This can revolutionize everything… It will elevate Alchemy into a more powerful magic.”
Catherine tilted her head, her expression unreadable as she considered their words.
The third merchants chuckled. “Study, leverage—it’s all the same in the right hands. Think of how many lives we can save with this knowledge, Katarina.”
“You know where it is, and we have the means to recover it. Name your price.”
Eddie’s thoughts churned. Why was Catherine speaking to these scholars about such dangerous things? And why hadn’t she mentioned any of this before?
Catherine leaned back in her chair, fingers drumming lightly against the wood. Her expression was impassive, but there was an edge to her voice when she finally spoke.
“You’re asking me to unearth something that was never meant to see the light of day,” she said. “Have you even considered the consequences? The codex wasn’t written for healing or progress—it was written in blood, for a war that killed millions.”
“You think we don’t know that?” The younger scholar shot back. “But this isn’t about its past. It’s about what it could do now. How many lives could be saved if we understood its knowledge?”
“And what happens when the wrong hands get hold of it?” Catherine shot back, “You don’t get to decide who wields that power once it’s out in the open.”
“No knowledge is inherently good or evil.” The merchant gave a knowing smile, lacing his fingers together. “It’s how you use it that matters. I suppose you understood that best.”
She didn’t answer right away, studying them in silence. The weight of her decision settled between them, thick as the candlelit shadows that flickered against the tavern walls.
Finally, she sighed, her fingers stilling. “If I agree,” she murmured. “You pay me upfront. No games. No bargaining.”
The scholar barely hesitated. “Done.”
With a sharp nod, he reached into his satchel and withdrew a worn parchment, unfolding it across the table. His finger traced a point near the jagged outline of a mountain range. 
“The codex is likely kept here—an old research laboratory, buried beneath the ruins of the bastion itself. We believe it was sealed centuries ago, by the Elves…” He glanced at Catherine pointedly. “This is where I suppose you come in.”
Catherine leaned in, studying the map. Her fingers brushed over the inked lines, taking in the details before she swiftly folded the parchment and tucked it into her sash.
The merchant beside him wordlessly placed a small pouch of coins on the table and nudged it toward her.
The shift was instant. Catherine’s seriousness melted away, replaced by a wide, triumphant grin—like a child handed a sack of sweets. She scooped up the pouch with a flourish, weighing it in her palm.
“Well, gentlemen, it’s been a pleasure doing business,” she said, her tone once again airy and playful. “Here’s hoping you don’t get yourselves hexed along the way.”
She left the table with a spring in her step, dodging the crowded pub toward the door. On her way, she tossed a few coins onto the bar, calling out a quick thanks to the barkeep.
Eddie’s heart raced as she approached. He sank deeper into his chair, his body to remain hidden in the pub’s dim lighting. The flicker of a gas lamp threw shadows across his face, and he held his breath as she passed mere feet away.
She didn’t notice him. The door swung shut behind her with a soft creak, and Eddie exhaled, relief washing over him.
The merchants remained at their table. They are deep in conversation, their voices slipping back into their native tongue. So many questions had popped inside Eddie, who were Catherine talking to? What is she doing here? And most importantly, what does she have to do with The Nightingale Dragon?
Maybe It’s a conversation for another day, Eddie wasn’t supposed to hear about this anyway, it was Catherine’s business, he shouldn’t pry. Eddie relaxed, taking another sip from his tankard,
But then—
“Were you listening, boy?”

-o-

The voice carried an unfamiliar accent, clipped and precise, with an edge of quiet authority. Eddie’s gaze snapped to the speaker—one of the scholars, the eldest among them. His grizzled beard was streaked with silver, his sharp eyes shadowed with suspicion.
“What did you hear?”
Eddie opened his mouth, but before he could answer, another of the scholars spoke up, his tone hushed but urgent. “What are you doing, brother? Leave him be.”
“No.” The elder scholar didn’t look away. “He was eavesdropping. He heard things not meant for him.”
The third scholar straightened, his expression darkening. “How long?”
“Don’t know,” the elder said, still watching Eddie like a hawk. “That’s what I intend to find out.”
A slow, heavy silence settled between them. The air in the tavern felt suddenly thicker, the clatter of mugs and distant laughter a world away.
At the elder scholar’s words, the other two followed suit. Their previous air of casual conversation had vanished, replaced by something colder, more calculating.
They moved as one, stepping away from their table and closing in around Eddie’s. The flickering gas lamp above cast long shadows across their faces, leaving their eyes glinting in the dim light. Eddie sat in the darkness beneath them, trapped under their watchful gaze.
“Look, I—I wasn’t—” Eddie stammered, his mind scrambling for an excuse.
“Don’t lie to me, boy.” The eldest scholar leaned closer, his tone low and deliberate. “How long were you listening? What did you hear?”
“N-no, I wasn’t listening, I—I’m just here for a drink,” Eddie stammered, his grip tightening around his tankard. His eyes flicked between them, searching for any sign of mercy.
“Liar,” the second scholar spat.
The third folded his arms, his expression grim. “He’s too well-dressed to be some common Weshaven drunk. And he’s alone. Could be one of them.”
Eddie’s stomach turned. Them?
The elder scholar exhaled sharply. “The underground has eyes everywhere. That’s how they work—blend in, listen, report. If he’s one of their spies… We’re done for!” 
Eddie’s hand patted against his jacket pocket. Then the next, and the next, his fingers patting each in turn as if searching for a lifeline. Nothing. He moved to the inner pocket. Still nothing.
Then—his pants pocket. His heart skipped a beat. There it was. A wand.
Torrie’s wand.
How did he still have it? He had meant to give it back earlier this morning, but with Markus coming in and everything else, it must’ve slipped his mind. His fingers curled around it instinctively.
The fishermen at the bar let out a booming laugh, the sound breaking briefly through Eddie’s rising panic, Indifferent to his danger.
Eddie’s eyes darted around the room, scanning for anything—anything—he could use. Then he saw it.
A dusty, half-forgotten bottle sat on a shelf behind the bar, its glass clouded with age. The dark liquid inside barely sloshed, thick and undisturbed, a relic from some long-gone era. But more importantly—Eddie knew what that meant.
Bingo! He thought.
Old spirits. High proof. Stored for years.
His mind raced. Over time, alcohol evaporates, saturating the air within the bottle. A single spark, the right amount of heat—boom.
A perfect distraction.
His stomach twisted. He had sworn never to use alchemy again. Never after—No, not now. Focus.
The scholars edged closer, their suspicion pressing down like a weight on his chest. He could talk his way out of a tavern brawl. But this? This was something else entirely. He couldn’t be tangled up with them. He had no choice.
Beneath the table, Eddie’s fingers brushed against Torrie’s wand.
A grim irony.
Slowly, he slid it free, concealing it against his leg. Taking a steadying breath, he traced a circle on the worn wood of the table, moving with quiet precision. Runes followed—water, alcohol, vapor, ignition. Each stroke glowed faintly before fading into the grain.
His heart pounded. He could feel the magic humming beneath his fingertips.
Just one spark…
With a swift flick of Torrie’s wand hidden beneath the table. He triggered the stages of transformation, shifting the bottle’s integrity.
A sharp crack.
The bottle didn’t just crack—it exploded.
A fiery burst of vapor and shattered glass erupted behind the burly fisherman, dousing his head in a splash of decades-old liquor. The shockwave sent nearby bottles toppling, and with them, more bursts of flame as their alcohol-rich vapors ignited.
A chain reaction.
But Eddie wasn’t done.
In the split second before the explosion, he lunged forward and shoved one of the scholar straight into the fisherman.
The timing was perfect.
The burly man staggered as the explosion seared the air behind him. And when he spun around, fists clenched, his furious gaze locked onto the scholar sprawled at his feet.
“You fucking bastard!” the fisherman roared.
“My vintage collection!” The barkeep screamed in horror, but his wail cut through the tavern as he watched years of fine wine flows down to the floor.
The scholar barely had time to stammer out a protest before the fisherman’s massive fist slammed into his jaw, sending him crashing into the second scholar.
The scimitar-wielder reached for his blade—too late. A second fisherman tackled him to the ground, locking thick arms around his waist.
The third scholar saw the chaos unfold and did the only thing he could—ran.
Eddie didn’t wait to see how it all played out.
He was already moving.
The pub filled with the sounds of shouting, breaking chairs, and clattering glass. Other fishermen joined in, eager for an excuse to throw a punch. The merchants, caught off guard, scrambled to defend themselves.
Eddie slid his chair back quietly, sinking deeper into the shadows. The commotion provided the perfect cover.
As fists flew and tables overturned, he clutched the wand tightly in his hand and edged toward the door.
Eddie slipped out of the pub and into the cool night air, the sounds of the brawl fading behind him. His heart pounded in his chest as he shoved Torrie’s wand back into his pocket.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3 V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie trudged down the stairs, rubbing the grogginess from his face. The scent of toast and eggs still clung to the air, though it had long since cooled. As he descended, the creaking steps announced his arrival before he even reached the bottom.
Torrie was already waiting in the lounge, perched primly on the edge of the couch with her legs swinging like a pendulum. Her school satchel was neatly placed by her feet, and her crisp new uniform looked like it had stepped straight out of the catalogue—complete with the oversized wide-brimmed hat resting like a halo on her head.
She turned to him, adjusting her giant round glasses as they caught the morning light. “You overslept again,” she said flatly, arms folded like a disappointed teacher.
Eddie yawned so wide it looked like it might swallow the staircase. “It’s called resting, actually. Very crucial to brain function. You’ll understand when you're older.”
Torrie raised an eyebrow. “You’re eighteen, not eighty.”
“And yet,” Eddie said, scratching the back of his neck, “my back still clicks like a haunted rocking chair.”
Torrie eyed him. “You did remember you were supposed to take me to Preston, right?”
Eddie hesitated just long enough for her smirk to widen.
“Oh my god,” she groaned dramatically, leaning her head back. “You forgot.”
“Hey, hey, I didn’t forget!” Eddie protested, pointing a finger at her. “I just… temporarily misplaced that piece of information.”
Torrie shook her head, exasperated but amused. &quot;You’re the worst.&quot;
“And yet,” Eddie said, heading toward the coat rack, “Here I am—up, dressed, vertical—ready to escort my little sister to her very first day of secondary school like the responsible brother that I am.”
She rolled her eyes. “Only because Mum threatened to scream your name into the void.”
As he passed her, he reached out to ruffle her hair, but Torrie ducked and jabbed him in the ribs with surprising accuracy. “Hands off the hat. This is a sacred hat.”
“You look like you’re leading a coven,” Eddie teased.
“And you look like you lost a fight with your laundry basket,” she shot back.
He smirked and opened the front door. “Race you to the shed?”
Torrie was already halfway out the door before he finished the sentence. “Last one there has to do Mum’s washing!”
“Oi!” Eddie shouted, chasing after her. “I didn’t agree on that!”

-o-

The shed was old—probably older than Eddie himself. The wooden beams sagged slightly under the weight of age and spiderwebs, and the scent of oil, damp wood, and rust lingered like a stubborn memory. Dusty sunlight filtered through the warped gaps in the planks, casting streaks of gold across crooked shelves, jars of loose bolts, and long-forgotten crates with peeling labels.
In the middle of it all stood Eddie’s bike.
It was an ancient, clunky thing—its red paint chipped like old war scars, the once-shiny chrome dulled to a pitted grey. The frame bore the legacy of several generations: his father’s initials still scratched faintly into the underside of the seat, and a frayed leather strap from who-knows-when was looped around the handlebars. It had survived more school runs, potholes, and emergency brake repairs than either of them could count. A relic of the Welton family, held together with duct tape, stubbornness, and just enough sheer luck to avoid total collapse.
Eddie knelt to tighten the strap securing their satchels onto the back rack. The bike gave a loud metallic groan as he jostled it. He paused, gave it a couple of firm bounces to test the wheels, and nodded like a surgeon satisfied with a patient’s pulse.
Torrie stood nearby, her hat tilted slightly back as she surveyed the machine with theatrical concern. “Do you ever clean this thing?”
Eddie scoffed. “It’s got character.”
“It’s got rust.”
“Character and rust,” he corrected, checking the pedals. “That’s what gives it charm.”
As Eddie adjusted the straps on their satchels, tightening the fraying cords around the battered back rack, Torrie sat swinging her legs off the bench just outside the shed. She tilted her head, watching him with a thoughtful squint behind her round glasses.
“So… are the teachers at Preston really as strict as Mom says?” she asked.
Eddie snorted as he gave the tires a final pump. “Most of them.”
He straightened up, arms folded, leaning against the bike like he was about to deliver a war story.
“Take Mrs. Neira. She teaches mathematics with iron fists. I swear she can spot an untucked shirt from fifty paces. One time, I tried hiding behind Jacob Weller’s head because I forgot my homework—she still found me.”
Torrie groaned, slumping back with theatrical despair. “Great. That sounds fantastic.”
“Oh, and don’t even think about dozing off in her class,” Eddie added, gesturing for effect. “She once hurled a marker across the classroom at me because I blinked too slow.”
Torrie’s eyes widened in horror and awe. “You’re joking.”
“Wish I was.”
She slumped dramatically against the wooden railing of the shed, letting her satchel tip against her side. “This is already sounding so fun.”
Eddie chuckled. “Not all the teachers are terrifying, though. Mr. Ferie—Chemistry teacher—is the exact opposite. Chill guy. He once let us set marshmallows on fire during a combustion demo.”
Torrie perked up slightly. “That sounds more like it.”
“Yeah, you’ll like him. He doesn’t make you feel stupid when you mess up.”
Torrie was quiet for a moment, then said, “Is that where you got into chemistry? From him?”
Eddie paused, fingers stilling on the strap buckle. The sunlight caught dust motes swirling lazily in the air, giving the shed an odd stillness for a moment.
He considered how to answer. The truth was harder to explain—how, ever since he was a kid, he’d sometimes see things. Not in the way people talked about seeing ghosts or lights or hallucinations. No, it was sharper than that. Stranger. He’d look at a metal pipe or a glass bottle and feel like he could see what it was made of—see the molecules, shifting and grinding beneath the surface, as if the world were just a puzzle of tiny, twitching parts waiting to be understood.
When he was twelve, it had been worse—so vivid it scared him. People whispered. Teachers looked worried. By fifteen, they called it schizophrenia. The medication dulled it. Smoothed the noise. But it never went away completely.
And somehow, in the middle of that mess, chemistry made sense. The formulas, the bonds, the way elements behaved—it all clicked like second nature. Like his brain had just been wired for it. Even if that same wiring made everything else harder. Even if it made him feel like a freak sometimes.
But how was he supposed to explain any of that to Torrie?
He shrugged, casually. “Kinda. I think when you get into school properly, and you study enough, something’ll just… click. Could be astronomy. Or history. Or mathematics, who knows. You’ll find something you’re into… For me, it was chemistry.”
Torrie looked at him, her expression unusually serious for a second.
“Yeah… but you’re like… you’re born with it,” she said. “And that’s cool.”
Eddie blinked at her.
Then, with a teasing grin, he ruffled her hat, knocking it askew. “You getting sappy on me, Torrington?”
She swatted his hand away, cheeks puffed up in mock indignation. “Ugh, forget I said anything!”
“Too late. I’m writing it down for blackmail purposes,” Eddie said, tapping the air like he had a pen. “‘Torrie Welton thinks her older brother is cool.’ Historic moment.”
“Stop it!”
He laughed and swung one leg over the bike. “Alright, alright. Let’s get going before you’re getting late and I’ll have to explain everything to mom. ”
Light poured in, golden and fresh, chasing away the dust and shadows. Outside, the streets of Weshaven beckoned—cobbled roads damp from morning mist, lined with wooden houses that leaned ever so slightly from the years. The sea breeze carried the scent of salt and fish, mixing with the distant chatter of merchants setting up their stalls.
Eddie swung a leg over the bike, glancing back at Torrie. “Alright, You ready?”
Torrie adjusted her hat, eyes bright. “Ready.”
And with that, they rode off, the old bike rattling down the street as the Welton siblings made their way through the waking town.

-o-

The bike wobbled slightly as Eddie pushed off from the curb, Torrie clinging tight behind him with her satchel bumping against his back. They rolled out of Howcliffe Road, the familiar rows of semi-detached houses blurring past, their gardens neatly fenced and driveways cluttered with bins and worn-out footballs. The morning sun had risen just high enough to cast a warm glow across the pavement, and the quiet hum of a Sunday morning still lingered.
As they turned off the main road, Torrie leaned forward. “Wait, we’re not taking the high street?”
“Nope,” Eddie replied, already pedaling harder as the terrain shifted. “We’re going the old way.”
Torrie made a noise of protest as the road turned bumpy and narrow, lined with low hedges and patches of gravel. “Ugh, Eddie. This is not a road. This is a punishment.”
Eddie grinned without looking back. “It’s a shortcut.”
“This is not a shortcut. It’s uphill. And full of holes. And my bum is going to file a formal complaint.”
But Eddie kept pedaling, determined. “Trust me. This is the way I used to take every day when I went to Preston. It's not the smoothest, not the fastest—but wait till you see the view.”
Grumbling, Torrie slumped back. “This better be the best view.”
They pushed onward. The path grew steeper for a stretch, winding between clusters of elder trees and hedgerows tangled with bramble. Birds chirped overhead, the air crisp and filled with the earthy scent of dew and soil. Then, as they crested the hill, the trees began to thin, giving way to wide, windswept grassland.
And there it was.
The North Downs Way stretched before them, its chalky path gleaming pale under the sun. The wind picked up, tugging at their clothes and lifting Torrie’s hat slightly askew. Beyond the cliff’s edge, the vast expanse of the English Channel shimmered in the morning light, and far below, the town of Dover unfolded like a toy village—its harbour glinting, rooftops jumbled together, ferries drifting lazily across the blue.
Torrie gasped. “Whoa.”
Eddie planted his feet, steadying the bike as they took in the view. “Told you.”
She didn’t answer at first, just stared, wind whipping her hair back. “Okay… maybe this wasn’t completely the worst idea.”
“High praise,” Eddie said, mock-bowing.
Torrie rolled her eyes. “Shut up.”
He nudged her with his elbow, grinning. “Admit it—you’re impressed.”
“…Maybe.”
They stood there for a moment longer, the wind rushing past them, cliffs glowing white against the sea.
Then Torrie cleared her throat. “So, how much longer till we get there?”
“About twenty minutes.”
“Better not be another hill.”
“No promises.”
“Eddie!”
But her laugh echoed down the trail behind them as they coasted forward, wind in their faces, the town of Dover watching from below like a quiet witness to their journey. </Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 8</Title>
            <Text>Eddie hunched over his desk, his headset snug over his ears, listening intently to the static crackling through the earpieces. His self-made radio—a tangle of gears, rune-etched components, and salvaged circuitry—sat before him, flickering weakly as he prodded at its inner workings with a screwdriver.
The device had been in perfect condition until a few days ago, when he’d lost his balance and sent both himself and the radio crashing to the floor. Now, after hours of painstaking adjustments, he was determined to get it working again.
He turned the dial with precise, deliberate movements, the static shifting in pitch, but still nothing recognizable came through. With a grunt, he adjusted a rune-etched copper coil, pressing it into place with the tip of his screwdriver. The blue light on the radio wavered, then stabilized.
Then—
Bzzt—crackle—shhhh—
Something different. Not just static. A faint distortion, something buried deep within the noise. Eddie’s fingers tightened around the radio’s frame as he slowly tuned the frequency. The sound wavered in and out, shifting between static and—
A voice.
It was distant, barely above a whisper, but unmistakably human. Eddie’s pulse quickened. He had tapped into a frequency! He leaned in closer, carefully adjusting the rune alignment, his breath held—
BAM!
The door swung open, slamming against the wall.
“Eddie!”
Eddie flinched, the screwdriver slipping from his grasp. The radio let out a sharp whine before the voice disintegrated into a wall of static. Gone.
“…Damn it.”
Torrie peeked inside, clutching a thick, leather-bound book to her chest. Her twin tails bounced slightly as she hurried up to his desk, her huge round glasses reflecting the morning light. “Can you teach me Alchemy?”
Eddie sighed, barely looked up, too focused on his broken radio. “Why not ask Catherine, Torrie?” He waved a hand vaguely. “She’s a Master Alchemist. And an elf. She’s a million times better at this stuff than I am.”
“She’s out with Mom and Dad,” Torrie said, stepping closer. “They went into town, and I’ve still got a few minutes before school.”
Eddie muttered something unintelligible as he prodded a rune-etched component with his screwdriver. Torrie, undeterred, plopped herself onto his bed.
“Come on, Eddie! I just got my textbooks and wand! And I wanna learn something cool before class!” She swung her legs impatiently, staring at him expectantly. “Just the basics! Please?”
Eddie sighed, rubbing his face with his free hand. “Torrie—”
“Pleeease?” She leaned forward, her big eyes practically doubling in size behind her glasses.
Eddie groaned, finally setting down his tools. “Fine. But just the basics.”
Torrie let out a triumphant cheer as Eddie shook his head, already regretting his decision.

-o-

The curtains diffused the morning light, creating a warm ambiance in the cosy living room of the Welton household. The house was quieter than usual—no bustling activity from the apothecary or the usual scent of herbal potions drifting from the brewing room. The usual hum of the apothecary was absent, leaving only the two of the siblings in the house for the moment.
The living room was quiet, save for the soft clink of a small vial being set onto the wooden table. Inside, a globule of shimmering Quicksilver shifted lazily, reflecting the morning light in liquid ripples. Torrie sat on the edge of her seat, her new Alchemy textbook spread open beside her, eyes gleaming with anticipation.
“So,” she said, tapping the assignment page. “On the first Chapter the task is to Change the Quicksilver from liquid to solid. How do I do that?”
Eddie leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. “Well, before you even think about manipulating it, you need to understand how it changes.”
Torrie frowned. “What do you mean how?”
Eddie picked up the vial, tilting it so the Quicksilver pooled to one side. “Alchemy works because we understand how materials are structured. Every substance exists in one of four fundamental states that an Alchemist can manipulate. Think of them like different forms of the same thing.”
He held up a finger. “First, Solid. It’s stable, structured, and holds its shape.”
A second finger. “Then, Liquid. Like this Quicksilver, it flows and adapts, but still has mass.”
A third finger. “Gas. Unstable, hard to control, spreads quickly.”
And finally, his pinky. “And lightning, or Plasma. The most chaotic, the hardest to transmute, but the most powerful in raw energy.”
Torrie’s eyes widened at that last one. “Wait—lightning counts as a state of matter?”
Eddie smirked. “Yeah, where else can you lump lightnings to?.”
Torrie huffed. “Okay, okay. So how do I actually change Quicksilver’s state?”
Eddie grabbed a piece of chalk and started sketching on the wooden surface. A circular pattern took shape—rings of symbols and interwoven lines forming a precise geometric array. 
“This is a Transmutation Circle,” Eddie explained. “An Alchemist doesn’t just will something to change like a Wizard. We are physically telling it how it should change. A properly drawn Transmutation Circle acts like a bridge between the material world and the Arcane Realm.”
Torrie nodded, watching intently. Then, after a moment of thought, she asked, “What is the Arcane Realm, exactly?”
Eddie exhaled, tapping the chalk against the floor. “That’s... complicated. Someone in Conjuration or Illusion would probably be able to explain it better. They deal with it more directly.” 
“From what I’ve heard,” Eddie frowned slightly, trying to recall what little he knew.  “It’s a place where time is a place. Like, you couldn’t just walk through it. That’s where all sorts of spectral creatures live, and where magic is drawn from.”
Torrie’s brows furrowed. “So it’s like another dimension?”
“Sort of. It’s said to overlap with our world—the Material Realm—but no one really knows how. Some people think you could step into it if you found the right place, but I wouldn’t try.” He shrugged. “Not my area of expertise. I just know that Alchemy communicates with it. The Arcane Realm makes the transmutation happen.”
Torrie nodded, watching intently as he added markings within the rings.
“For this exercise, you’d need to break the Quicksilver down at a fundamental level—understand its structure, its bonds, its potential for shifting states.” He tapped the chalk against the center of the circle. “Then, by channeling magic through the circle, you command the Arcane to rearrange those bonds—turning liquid to solid, or back again.”
Torrie stared at the glowing lines of the circle, excitement bubbling up. “So… can I try?”
Eddie gave a half-smile and slid the chalk toward her. “Go for it.”
Torrie straightened her back, reaching into her satchel with an eager glint in her eyes. She pulled out a small wooden box, its surface embossed with the Aella Academy crest. She lifted the lid, revealing a pristine wand nestled in velvet lining. It was brand new—smooth, polished, and untouched by use.
She picked it up, running her fingers along the lacquered wood. It was a standard-issue wand from Aella Academy—nothing special, mass-produced for students. The polished surface gleamed faintly in the morning light, reflecting her excitement.
But to Eddie, it was just reminder of the past. He had once owned the same kind of wand, back when things were simpler. 
Pushing aside the memory, Eddie watched as Torrie tapped the wand against the transmutation circle.
Nothing.
She frowned, furrowing her brows in concentration. With a sharp breath, she tried again.
This time, a faint white glow pulsed from the circle… but then it fizzled out like a dying ember.
Eddie barely contained his chuckle, but the slight shake of his shoulders gave him away.
Torrie turned to him, eyes narrowing. “What?”
“No, Nothing,” he said, biting back his grin. “You’re doing great.”
She pouted. “You’re lying.”
Eddie leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “Alright, alright. Tell me—do you still have that ring I gave you a few years ago?”
Torrie blinked. “You mean your heirloom ring?”
Eddie nodded, “Yeah, that one.”
With a curious look, Torrie reached under her sweater, pulling out a thin silver chain. Dangling at the end was the ring—a simple band of dark metal, faintly etched with intricate alchemical symbols.
Eddie let out a small breath of relief. “You kept it well.”
“Of course, I did,” Torrie said, holding it up. “But… why?”
Eddie took the ring gently from her grasp, turning it between his fingers. “Your wand’s fine for spellcasting, but it’ll be different for Alchemy. The ring will help focus your magic—make channeling the Arcane much easier.”
Torrie hesitated, then nodded. She slipped the ring onto her index finger. It was far too big for her—heavy, oversized—but she clenched her fist, determined.
Then, something changed.
The transmutation circle pulsed with a deep green light, arcs of energy crackling through the etched symbols.
The Quicksilver in the vial trembled. Then, as if responding to an invisible force, it rose—slowly at first, then faster—solidifying into jagged crystalline peaks.
Torrie gasped. “I—I did it!”
She turned to Eddie, beaming.
Eddie smirked. “Told you so.”
Torrie let out an excited laugh, fists clenched in triumph. She had just performed her first transmutation.
Eddie laughed under his breath. The silence between them lingered for a moment, broken only by the soft hum of the fan and the rustling of Torrie’s broom.
Then Torrie spoke, her tone more curious than teasing. “Hey, Eddie…”
“Hmm?”
“Why’d you give me the ring?”
Eddie froze in his seat. The question hung in the air like a weight, heavier than the smell of burnt copper. He set the cloth down, avoiding Torrie’s gaze.
“You never told me,” she continued, her voice quieter now. “I mean, it’s your family’s heirloom, right? From your real family.”
Eddie exhaled, his hand tightening around the edge of the table. “Yeah, it is.”
Torrie stopped sweeping, leaning on the broom as she watched him. “So why me?”
Torrie was perched on the armrest of the couch, still fiddling with the jade-silver ring. She twirled it around her finger, her gaze thoughtful.
Eddie glanced at the silver-jade ring on Torrie’s finger as she turned it, the green stone catching the light.
“You’ll use them more than I will,” Eddie said, his tone casual, though there was an edge of finality to it. “You’re just starting in Aella Academy. You’ll need all the help you can get.”
Torrie tilted her head, her eyes narrowing. “But why don’t you need it?”
The question was so simple, so direct, that it caught Eddie off guard. Momentarily, he just stared at the textbook on the table, as though it held the answer.
Torrie leaned forward, her tone still curious but now laced with something deeper. “What do you mean, Eddie? Why don’t you use it anymore?”
He opened his mouth, then closed it again, the words sticking in his throat.
“I just… don’t, alright?” he finally said, his voice quieter than usual.
Torrie frowned, unsatisfied. “That’s not an answer.”
Eddie ran a hand through his silver hair, the gesture betraying his frustration. “It’s complicated, Torrie.”
“Then uncomplicate it,” she shot back, her tone sharper now. “You were amazing at Alchemy. The teachers at Aella Academy said so. So why—” She stopped herself, hesitating. 
The room felt smaller, the air heavier, even with the window open and the fan whirring. Eddie leaned back against the table, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Torrie… I don’t think you’d understand,” he said finally, his voice low.
Torrie stood, her expression a mix of defiance and hurt. “Then make me.”
After a moment, he managed a half-hearted smile. “It’s because I’m focusing on potion-making now. You know, that doesn’t really use magic much.”
Torrie raised an eyebrow, unconvinced. “Really? Potion-making doesn’t use magic much?”
Eddie chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “Well, it’s true. You don’t need fancy transmutations for chopping herbs or boiling cauldrons, you know?”
Torrie crossed her arms, her expression skeptical. “Eddie, you’re terrible at lying. You know that, right?”
Before she could press further, the front door creaked open.
“Eddie?” Markus called from the doorway.
He stepped inside, holding the edge of the doorframe with one hand and looking flustered. “Do you have the key to the shop? It’s opening time, and I can’t find it anywhere.”
Relieved, Eddie slumped his shoulders, then straightened, taking the opportunity. “Oh, uh, yeah, I think I’ve got it.” He patted his pockets with exaggerated enthusiasm, already making his way toward the door. “Let me check.”
Torrie watched him go, her eyes narrowing. “Eddie…” she started, but he cut her off.
“I’ll be right back!” he said over his shoulder, his tone too bright, too eager. “Markus and I need to get the storefront sorted.”
Eddie was just about to step out the door, a mix of relief and escape flooding through him, when Torrie’s voice cut through the air.
“Eddie?”
He froze, his hand on the doorframe, the cool wood under his fingertips feeling heavier than before. He turned back to see her standing in the doorway, holding something in her hand.
Torrie’s fingers were wrapped around the chains, and Eddie’s heirloom ring—engraved with symbols of his family—rested on top. She was offering it back to him, the delicate metal glinting in the light.
“Here,” Torrie said, her voice small but firm. “Take it back. It’s yours. They are meant to be yours.”
For a long moment, neither of them spoke. Torrie’s eyes were steady, piercing his green eyes, as though trying to read something he wasn’t saying. Eddie felt a strange knot tighten in his chest. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words stuck in his throat.
Then, with a deep breath, he smiled—a soft, forced thing that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“No,” Eddie said quietly, his voice almost lost in the air between them. “Keep it. It’s better suited for you than me.”
Torrie’s brows furrowed, a flash of confusion in her expression. She didn’t argue, as if accepting the weight of his decision. Slowly, she closed her fingers around the ring once more, her grip firm and determined.
Eddie gave her one last glance, a final, fleeting look that held everything they both left unsaid, then turned away, slipping out the door and into the early morning light.
He walked, his steps quick and purposeful, as if the moment with Torrie had never happened. As he passed the familiar sights of Weshaven, his thoughts shifted back to his routine—The Apothecary, his work, the things that didn’t ask him to explain anything.
The weight of the ring was no longer in his pocket, but he could still feel it, a reminder he had left behind.
And just like that, he lost himself in the rhythm of his day.</Text>
            <Notes>1. Eddie is in his room, tinkering with his self-made radio and headset, who apparently he had accidently broke when he fell of his chair a few days ago

2. Torrie came in barging, she wants Eddie to teach her the basic of Alchemy, since she just got her textbooksAt first Eddie brushed her off, not paying attention, saying that why not ask Aunt Catherine? She’s better at Alchemy.She said Catherine and their parents is away at the town, and she still got a few minutes before schoolShe kept bugging him, and eventually Eddie relented, agreeing to teach her the basics of Alchemy

(Eddie agrees to teach Torrie about the basic of Elements and Matter States) 


1. Eddie and Torrie is at the living room

2. Torrie wants to do the first Assignment, that is Manipulating a Quicksilver, which is a Metal usually used for students practicing Alchemy

The assignment is saying that the student must be able to manipulate the State of Matter of the Quicksilver from Liquid into Solid, and back again into Liquid

Torrie then asked Eddie how can she do that,

Eddie then explained in Alchemy, an object is devided into 4 different states of matter an Alchemist can manipulate:1. Solid (Firmus)
2. Liquid (Fluensus)
3. Gas (Caligo)
4. And Lightning (Flumens)And an Alchemist can command the Arcane (which where magic came from in this series) through a Transmutation Circle

If an Alchemist can detail the material’s components and how it can be broken down, the transmutation circle will communicate it to the arcane realm and make it happen, hence, the Magic of Alchemy

Eddie just so happen to have his old practicing tool, that is a Quicksilver that is encased in glass, since Quicksilver Metal is highly toxic, it is safer to be put in the glass

            <Title>Chapter 12E</Title>
            <Text>The morning air was cool and crisp as Eddie, Will, Ashley, Henry, Jake, Jane, and Catherine stood in front of the Cerberus Tavern. The barman was assisting Tiara with her armor, his movements precise and practiced, like a squire aiding a knight.
Eddie and the others watched in silent awe, the clinking of metal and the careful buckling of straps filling the air. None of them had ever seen someone donning armor before, and the sight was mesmerizing. Tiara stood tall and steady as the barman secured each piece, her presence commanding but calm. The gleaming silver of her armor, polished to a mirror-like finish, caught the morning light. Her twin maces, symbols of her formidable strength, rested against the nearby wall, waiting to be wielded.
When the barman finished, Tiara reached for her maces, sliding them into place on her hips with practiced ease. Then, with a flourish, she draped a dark, earthy-brown cloak over her shoulders, the fabric flowing down and partially obscuring her armor. The heavy, utilitarian look of the cloak contrasted with the elegance of her polished gear.
She turned to the group, her gaze steady but not unkind. “You’ll all need cloaks,” she said, gesturing toward a pile the barman had brought out. “Down in the Underground, anonymity is survival. The fewer eyes recognize you, the safer you’ll be.”
Eddie reached for a cloak, the material coarse but warm, and threw it over his shoulders, fastening it at the front. The others followed suit, some adjusting their hoods to obscure their features.
Tiara’s sharp gaze then shifted to Catherine. “Especially you, Cathy,” she said, her tone firm but carrying a hint of teasing. “Not to be discriminatory, but those pointed ears of yours will set people off. Elves don’t have the best reputation down there, and I’d rather not start a riot.”
Catherine’s face twisted into an exaggerated pout, her usual playful demeanor surfacing. “Oh, I see how it is. Discrimination against elves, is it? Why, Tiara, I expected better from you.”
Tiara rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with dry sarcasm. “Cathy, I’m a werewolf. Trust me, I’ve had it far worse than you’ll ever know. People in the Underground love to hate something. You’ll survive.”
The group chuckled softly, the moment of levity cutting through the tension of the morning. Even Catherine couldn’t help but grin as she adjusted her cloak, pulling the hood up over her silvery hair and pointed ears.
Henry glanced nervously at his car, already filled to capacity with his dorm mates and Catherine. “Uh… I don’t think there’s any room left. I mean, it’s cramped already, and with…” His eyes darted toward Tiara, who stood tall and imposing in her armor. “How’s she supposed to fit?”
Tiara crossed her arms, her brow raised slightly. “I can fit just fine,” she said, her voice calm yet with an edge of amusement.
Will, ever the diplomat, cleared his throat. “I mean no offense, Lady Tiara,” he said carefully, “but, um, you’re… uh…” He gestured vaguely at her size and armor. “And the car is… small.”
A grin tugged at the corner of Tiara’s lips. “Relax,” she said, pulling her hood further over her head. “I’ve got this.”
Before anyone could respond, her form began to shift. Her already impressive stature seemed to shrink as her limbs morphed, her cloak flowing around her like liquid shadow. Within moments, Tiara was no longer standing before them as a tall, armored warrior but as a sleek, normal-looking wolf. Her fur was a deep gray, speckled with darker streaks, and her golden eyes gleamed with intelligence.
The group stared, mouths agape. Will’s jaw dropped, Ashley gasped, and Jake let out an incredulous laugh. “No way,” Jake whispered. “That’s… awesome.”
Catherine, however, wasted no time. She crouched beside Tiara, her eyes lighting up with childlike delight. “Oh my gods, you’re so fluffy!” she exclaimed, immediately reaching out to pat Tiara’s head and scratch behind her ears. “Who’s a good—”
Before she could finish, Tiara barked sharply and growled, her ears flattening. The sound was a clear warning, and Catherine recoiled slightly, her playful grin replaced with an exaggerated pout. “Aw, come on, Tia! You’re adorable.”
Tiara huffed, her golden eyes narrowing in a way that seemed to say, I am not a household dog.
Eddie, meanwhile, couldn’t suppress a laugh. “Catherine, I think she’s trying to remind you she’s still the Captain of the Royal Paladins.”
Catherine sighed dramatically, standing up and dusting her hands. “Fine, fine, no head pats. But you can’t blame me for trying. You’re so cute like this.”
Tiara growled softly again but padded over to the car, her movements graceful and efficient. She hopped into the trunk area, curling up neatly, her tail wrapping around her body. Despite the tight space, she fit perfectly, proving her point without needing to say a word.
Henry scratched the back of his head, still processing what he’d just seen. “Well… that works, I guess.”
Eddie climbed into the car, shaking his head with a smile. “Remind me never to underestimate her again.”
As the group settled in and the car started down the road, Eddie couldn’t help but glance back at Tiara in her wolf form, her sharp eyes scanning the surroundings even as she appeared to rest. She wasn’t just a fighter; she was something far more extraordinary. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5E V2</Title>
            <Text>The morning sun painted Edenfield's cobblestones gold, the same way it had on Eddie's first orientation day. Back then, he'd mistaken the clusters of posters for event notices - only later realizing the flowers and beer cans beneath them weren't decorations but offerings. Now he understood the truth in the wilted petals and melted candle wax.
His fingers left smudges on Madeleine's poster as he pressed it against a bulletin board. Nearby, a group of prospective students in crisp academy uniforms whispered behind their hands. One girl's eyes darted between Eddie's hollow expression and the missing poster, her smile fading into something uncertain. The contrast stung - their bright-eyed curiosity against his grim task.
Will worked silently beside him, their usual banter buried under the weight of paper and paste. Eddie watched his friend's hands smooth a poster's edges with uncharacteristic care, the motion too gentle for Will's usual brashness. Something about the sight made Eddie's throat tighten.
Without a word, he drifted away from Will's steady presence. His feet carried him past the laughing academy students, past the bustling coffee cart where Madeleine always bought those too-sweet pastries, to the quiet corner where the missing were remembered.
The shrine had grown since orientation week. Dozens of faces smiled from rain-warped posters, their edges curling like dying leaves. Eddie's hands didn't shake as he added Madeleine to their ranks. He lit three candles - one for each month they'd known her - and placed a raspberry danish beneath her photo. The jam filling glistened like fresh blood in the sunlight.
When he returned to Will, the pastry's absence from his hands went unmentioned. They continued their work in silence, the shrine's candles flickering at their backs like distant watchfires

-o-

The library bench's cold iron bit into Eddie's thighs as he stared at the half-empty glue pot. Dried paste crusted his fingernails - flecks of white like shattered porcelain against his skin. Around him, the campus hummed with ordinary life: a study group debating spell theory, first-years giggling over shared notes, the distant chime of the clocktower. None of them knew. None of them cared.
His thumb brushed Madeleine's remaining poster. The paper remembered her better than he did now - that precise arch of her eyebrow when explaining his failures. &quot;Your magic isn't broken,&quot; she'd said last winter, steam from her tea curling between them in the library's forbidden snacks corner. &quot;It's older than these textbooks. Older than the university's foundations.&quot; Her fingertip had traced the strange sigils his spells left behind. &quot;The stones remember what the professors forgot.&quot;
A shadow fell across the posters. Red hair catching the sun like copper wire. The scent of cinnamon and ink - Madeleine always smelled like the library's restricted section after hours. A paper cup appeared in his vision, the university café's logo smudged where her thumb rested.
&quot;Oi mate, you there?&quot;
The cup wavered. Red darkened to dirty blond. The hand holding it bore Will's knuckle scar from last semester's bar fight. Madeleine's knowing smile fractured into Will's lopsided grin as Eddie blinked.
&quot;Drink up.&quot; Will cracked open a beer can with his free hand, the hiss loud as spellwork in the quiet space between them. &quot;You look like you've seen a ghost.&quot;
Eddie took the proffered drink. The aluminum burned with cold where Will's fingers had been. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he lied, the word sticking to his dry throat. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

The poster's fluttering edges sounded like whispering voices as Madeleine's face tilted skyward. Eddie's fingers dented the beer can, the cold metal biting into his palm. Condensation dripped onto his trousers like tears he couldn't shed.
&quot;I should've known.&quot; The words tore from somewhere raw beneath his ribs. &quot;Months of sharing meals, of late-night study sessions...&quot; His thumb rubbed at the can's tab, back and forth like a ward against evil. &quot;How many times did he sit right there&quot;—he jerked his chin toward the empty bench beside them—&quot;laughing at how stupid we were?&quot;
Will's hand closed around Eddie's forearm, calluses scraping against skin. &quot;The best liars don't wear masks.&quot; His usual boisterous tone had been stripped down to something quieter, harder. &quot;They wear smiles.&quot;
Eddie shook his head, unconvinced. &quot;But I should have seen it. I was seeing him for months, for crying out loud! There were signs, little things that just didn't sit right. I ignored them. And now Madeleine...&quot; 
&quot;Ed, listen to me man.&quot; He said firmly. &quot;You can't blame yourself for this. You ain’t mind readers. Nobody expects you to see through people, it’s not your fault.&quot;

A heavy silence descended upon them, broken only by the distant sounds of students hurrying to their evening classes. Finally, after a long moment, Will spoke again, her voice softer now, laced with a hint of curiosity.
&quot;You cared a lot about her, didn't you, Ed?&quot; He asked, a knowing smile playing on her lips.
Eddie met his gaze, a flicker of surprise crossing his features. He hesitated for a moment, then a small, genuine smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he admitted sheepishly. &quot;More than I ever admitted… I guess.&quot;
The last of the sunlight bled out over the library's spires, painting Will's profile in alpine gold. He turned the empty beer can between his hands, the aluminum crunching like packed snow under boots.
&quot;You ever hear how I ended up at Edenfield?&quot; His Isgardian accent thickened, vowels rounding like river stones. &quot;Back in Frostford Vale up north, there was this girl. Worked at the mead hall… I was still a blacksmith back then.&quot; A muscle jumped in his jaw. &quot;Had about as much charm as a startled reindeer, so naturally I never—&quot;
The can collapsed in his grip with a sound like breaking ice.
The wind carried the distant chime of the university clock. Will's fingers absently traced the scar on his knuckles—the one Eddie now realized might've come from something more personal than a bar fight. 
&quot;Next summer when I went home, she was wearing another man's ring.&quot; He turned to Eddie, the usual mischief gone from his eyes.
Eddie studied his friend—really studied him. The way Will's shoulders braced against the memory like against a mountain wind. The faded scar across his knuckles from whatever brawl had followed that news. This wasn't just advice; it was a confession carved from permafrost.
Will nudged him with an elbow. &quot;If she ever gets back,&quot; he said, jerking his chin toward Madeleine's fluttering poster, &quot;You ring that girl before some other alchemy prick beats you to it, yeah?&quot;
Heat crawled up Eddie's neck. &quot;Oh, shut up, Chester.&quot;
But Will was already grinning, the old mischief returning as he mimed holding a telephone. &quot;Just sayin'. Your voice cracks less on calls than in person.&quot;
For the first time since the posters went up, Eddie laughed—a raw, startled sound that scared a flock of starlings from the library's eaves. Will released him with a final rough tousle of his hair.


As Eddie and Will sat onto a bench outside the library, the weight of their shared sorrow momentarily lifted by the simple act of companionship
”Ed!” Ashley shouted from the distant lawn, her voice is distant and he looked so small from across the lawn,
As she closes the distance Ashley's footsteps echo against the pavement as she gets closer between them. Her arrival is unexpected but welcome, a ray of light piercing through the darkness of uncertainty.
Eddie spotted Ashley first, her dark cloak fluttering like a battle standard as she crossed the quad. Then his stomach dropped. Two figures trailed behind her—one with perfectly coiled platinum braids, the other a hulking shadow. Even from this distance, Christine's prissy gait and Geralt's lumbering steps were unmistakable.
&quot;Well shit,&quot; Will muttered, cracking his knuckles. &quot;Thought we wouldn’t deal with them again.&quot;
Ashley took a moment to catch her breath, gratefully accepting the drink Will offered and sat next to her on the stairs. &quot;I spoke with my advocacy group,&quot; she explained, downing a large gulp of the cool liquid. &quot;I thnk I know how can we find Madeleine.&quot;
&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Eddie cut in, clapping slowly. &quot;Brilliant plan, Ash. Truly inspired. But why in the nine hells are they here?&quot; He jabbed a finger at Christine, who was examining her manicure with practiced boredom.
“Christine, here is—“ But before Ashley could finish her sentence, she was cut off.
Christine snapped her head up, eyes flashing. &quot;Because unlike some people, I actually care about finding the missing.&quot; She thrust a poster at Eddie's chest—a grinning dark-haired boy labeled Dominic Laverne: Last Seen Near South Gate.
Eddie's fingers crumpled the edges. He remembered Dominic—quiet transfer student, always sketching in the library alcoves. The realization hit like a gut punch: this wasn't just about Madeleine anymore.
Ashley stepped between them like a referee. &quot;We need everyone who—&quot;
&quot;Still playing the hero, Ed?&quot; Christine's laugh was all venom. &quot;What, your little girlfriend—&quot;
Eddie's chair screeched as he stood. &quot;Finish that sentence, sorceress. I dare you.&quot;
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Ashley slammed her staff between them. The oakwood hummed with residual magic. &quot;Dominic. Madeleine. The twenty-three others on this list—&quot; She yanked a Campus Watch dossier from her bag, pages fluttering like wounded birds. &quot;They're not coming home unless we work together.&quot;
&quot;Think about it,&quot; Ashley continued, her voice gaining strength. &quot;There must be others who have put up missing person posters around campus other than us, people with contact information. We could reach out to them, offer them a chance to join forces. We wouldn't be an army of Royal Paladins, of course, but we will be driven by a common purpose – to bring down the Black Hand and find the people they love.&quot;
Eddie's jaw worked. Christine's perfect nails dug into Dominic's poster. The quad's chatter—laughter, spell practice, someone playing a lute badly—felt obscenely loud against their silence.
Finally, Christine smoothed her robes with exaggerated care. &quot;My father's office has access to the citywide missing persons registry.&quot; She said it like granting a royal favor.
Will snorted. &quot;And what do you want, princess?&quot;
&quot;Same as you.&quot; Christine's gaze flicked to Dominic's photo, just for a heartbeat. 
Ashley's grin was all teeth. &quot;Then we start calling every name in this file. Tonight.&quot;
The grudging nods took a lifetime. But when Christine turned away, Eddie caught the tremor in her hands—the same one he'd been hiding since yesterday. Maybe hate could wait. For now.

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 10</Title>
            <Text>His breath is still rugged as he panted, he took a long deep breath.
The gas lamps above flickered, their dim glow casting long shadows across the empty street. His fingers tightened around the wand in his hand. He looked down at it—Torrie’s wand—feeling the weight of what he’d just done.
He looked down at the wand in his hand, a mixture of disbelief and relief flooding through him. The smooth, slender stick of wood had pulled him out of yet another mess—a mess that could’ve ended with him face down in the wooden floorboards.
A slow chuckle escaped him, half disbelieving, half resigned.
Alchemy. Again.
“God damn it,” he muttered under his breath, “I could never escape using you, huh.” grinning to himself.
But before he could enjoy a moment of quiet and stillness, a voice broke through.
“Nice feeling, isn’t it?”
Eddie’s head snapped up. His pulse spiked, but he forced himself to stay still.
A figure stepped out from the alleyway, framed by the golden lamplight. Catherine.
She sauntered closer, her lips curled in amusement, her emerald eyes gleaming like a cat who had just found its next game. “You know,” she mused, tilting her head, “the Alamirian Scholars were right about one thing, Edward. Eavesdropping isn’t the most polite thing to do.”
Eddie exhaled through his nose. Of course. She was always a step ahead.
Behind them, the pub door burst open, spilling light, shouting, and a few flailing bodies onto the street. The brawl was in full swing now.
Catherine glanced over at the chaos, then back at Eddie. “Come,” she said, stepping closer, voice smooth and coaxing. “Let’s get away from this mess.”
Eddie cast one last glance at the ruckus before letting out a slow breath. He shoved Torrie’s school-issued wand into his pocket.
“Yeah,” he muttered. “I could use a walk.”
With an effortless turn, Catherine strolled down the street, her red coat swaying behind her.
Eddie followed.
 
-o-
 
As they walked, the streets seemed quieter now. Save for the distant clink of metal and breaking wood from the pub’s brawl muffled behind them.
Catherine, however, seemed to be deep in thought. After a while, she broke the quiet.
“Do you remember that day at the dining table when I first arrived?”
“Vaguely,” he replied.
“You said you were working on something.&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;You are working for your advanced magical education in the Universities,” she continued.
&quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; Eddie lied.
“And when I asked if you were considering applying for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship, you said yes.”
&quot;Yeah, I am.&quot; Eddie continued his lie.
“But you’re not, are you, Edward?” She continued, 
Eddie stopped his track, the wind continues to howl, there is no point in hiding it anymore
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eddie said, admitting the truth
“Why lie?&quot; Catherine stopped, looked back towards Eddie, her voice soft, &quot;I know you have so much ambition for Alchemy, but now you act like it’s something to run from.”
Eddie froze, his jaw tightened. He couldn’t do this—not with Catherine, not now. She was pressing on a wound he wasn’t ready to open.
But Catherine wasn’t about to let it go. She had always been the type to ask the hard questions, to dig until she found the truth, unlike him, she is an Alchemist, a real Alchemist, and like an Alchemist she will dig the truth. 
“I might not be around by the time you enrolled in Aella Academy,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but insistent. “But I was around when you’re so passionate about your first transmutation, when you’re going to ruins and dungeons retracing the steps of famous Alchemists, when you said you wanted to go to Edenfield University to become an Alchemist.”
“You used to be so passionate about Alchemy.  What happened?” Her eyes searched his face, hoping to understand the change she couldn’t quite place. 
He couldn’t tell her. He couldn’t tell anyone.
“Fifteen years, Eddie.” Catherine’s voice broke through his spiralling thoughts, “Fifteen years is nothing for someone like me. But for you... for you, I know it must have felt like a lifetime. Something happened to you during those years I was gone, something that changes you.”
He kept his gaze forward, avoiding Catherine's eyes; the words swirling in his mind but not forming on his tongue. How could he explain the loss, the guilt, the fear? How could he explain the day he had ruined his life—and someone else’s—forever?
He still couldn’t tell her. He still couldn’t tell anyone.
Finally, she sighed. “Look, I’m not going to pretend I understand what happened to you, because I certainly don’t. But I do know that you’ve changed.”
“And not in a good way.” Catherine continued, “You’re not the person I knew, you’re not the person Torrie knew. You’ve built up walls around yourself, and from what I’ve seen, it’s tearing you apart-”
“Just drop it.” Eddie interrupted, still trying to keep a polite smile.
“I beg your pardon?” Catherine responded
“Just drop it.” Eddie said with more resolution, his voice now laden with more frustation, “People has been prying on that fact, Eddie why are you not doing alchemy anymore? Eddie why aren’t you doing your transmutation anymore? Eddie where is your passion in Alchemy?”
Eddie stood there, his smile fading, he is not trying to be polite anymore, he is not lying anymore, “I’m sick of it. I’m not interested in Alchemy anymore, okay? I’m sick of people bringing it up, I’m sick of Alchemy. So please, Catherine…”
“Just fucking drop it.”
Catherine stood there clearly taken aback, Eddie expected for her to get offended, then throwing him a three hour lecture about the importance of Alchemy, but then, she just smiled, a teasing smile as if she just found something amusing.
“I see,” Catherine finally said, sighing, crossing her arms, “Fine by me, then. I’ll drop the topic.”
A sense of ease fills Eddie, finally, some peace and quiet, no more prying, no more question-
“But I will only drop the topic only if you can drop your act.”
Eddie stood there, his heart lurching.
“What?” Eddie said, not quite sure what he was hearing, “What do you mean?”
“Don’t you see yourself, Edward?” Catherine said, now turning towards the pier, her arms resting on its wooden railing, “If you’re truly disinterested in Alchemy… sick of it, even.”
She then turned her head, facing Eddie, her short hair blown by the cold, sea breeze, “Then why keep working on it?”
“I see the formula you perfected up in Robert’s tower, Edward.” Catherine continued, “The assignments you’ve helped Torrie with.”
“And don’t even get me started with your room.” Catherine continued, now turning her body, still leaning to the wooden railing, “The transmutation circles you’ve designed in your spare time, the copies of Alchemical tomes scattered on your desk, how you tried to continue your research from Aella Academy, and don't say that you did all of that hard work just for 'fun'.”
Catherine opened her arms, “Why do all of that, if you’re sick of it?”
She now puts her hands back on her coat’s pocket, “I would’ve let you slide if you truly, truly hate it, Edward, sure. But the fact is that you don’t. You still have that passion roaring deep within you that you tried to suppress, you’re playing an act of hating Alchemy whilst the fact that you still passionate about it. That, I can’t stand.”
“Then what do you want me to do?” Eddie asked, chuckling sarcastically, his voice low, his eyes finally meeting hers. “Do you want me just to get back to it? Pick it up again like nothing happened?”
Catherine stood there for a moment, leaning against the pier.
“I wished you were, but i know it’s not that simple, is it? I don't know what happened to you during the years i was gone, and surely Torrie and your parents didn't know too because you didn't tell them.” Her gaze steady, and then she gave him a small, determined smile. “So, despite all of that. I’m going to offer you something different.”
Catherine stood there, the wind blows her short apple-red hair, her red coat flutters in the cold evening breeze like a flag of declaration, the silhouette of her sharp elven ear made the whole scene felt like a fairy tale. She then looked at Eddie's eyes, taking her hand out of her pocket, and raising it, and points it straight at his face.
“I’m offering you an adventure.”
For a moment, Eddie could only stare. The scene before him felt unreal—like something out of a storybook, a fleeting moment of magic woven into the fabric of his mundane, daily life.
The streets were hushed, distant from the uproar of the tavern. The world around them had shrunk to just this. 
Flickering lamplight, whispers of the wind, the gentle sound of the ocean waves hitting the pier. And the unwavering intensity of Catherine’s gaze.
 “What?” He laughed softly, as if snapping back to reality, still trying to process it. “What are you even talking about?”
&quot;I'm offering you an Adventure for you to be a part of.&quot; Catherine repeated, her voice steady and firm. “There’s a Codex hidden deep within the illusory forest of The Deep Glaive, that was what i was discussing with the Alamirian Scholars back there, it will be a journey into the unknown part of Weshaven. I could use a fellow Alchemist like you.&quot; She smiled, &quot;It'll be like the old days, isn't it?”
“A fellow, is a hard stretch don’t you think, Catherine?” Eddie chuckled, his face sombre, “It can't be like the old days, you know? I’m not that kid anymore, Catherine,” he said quietly. “I can’t be that kid. That kid is no more.”
“Of course you're not, you'll never be as idiotic and reckless as your younger days...” Catherine laughed,  “You don’t have to be that kid, Eddie. You just need to be you.”
Eddie looked into her eyes, seeing the earnestness in her gaze. An invitation, a chance to leave behind his regrets and step back into something larger than himself.
He didn’t have an answer right away. But in the silence that followed, he knew that Catherine wasn’t going to let him walk away from this, not that easily. Not when she knew something about him.
“I don’t know,” Eddie said.
“It’s okay,” Catherine said, now continuing her pace, Eddie followed, the cadence of their footsteps echoes through the hard cobblestone road, “But you don’t have to lie anymore, it’s futile. You can lie all you want to Torrie, to Markus, Alyssa, Robert. But one thing for certain.”
“You can’t lie to a fellow Alchemist.”</Text>

Whodunnit

WHY does Walther do what he did?

Need 3 components:
1. A Detective
They must be wholly unprepared for what they’re getting into (regardless of their job and/or experience), and they must have a reason for being dragged into this mess

2. A Secret
As the detective unravels the clues, and you, the author, continue to turn over the cards, the secret is finally revealed. This secret is why we search for the truth to begin with. It’s the heart of the Whydunit. It’s not just the who and the why. It’s the what, where, and when, too! It’s what keeps the reader guessing until the very end. The bait that pulls us through the entire story.
And you, the author, need to make sure the secret is a good one. The secret often starts out small but grows as the detective digs deeper into the case and uncovers more clues. 

3. A Dark Turn
But as the secret grows deeper, so does the detective’s desire to solve the case, which leads to their dark turn, the third ingredient of a Whydunit. The dark turn is the moment when the hero breaks or abandons the rules (either their own or society’s) in pursuit of the secret or the truth. 
The rules broken can be moral, societal, or personal. The point is to show how this case has affected your detective. They’re now doing things they’ve never done before—going to places they’ve never gone before—all in pursuit of this secret. But ultimately it’s almost always that dark turn that leads the hero to the theme that will transform them.


In the end, the detective, the secret, and the dark turn all serve one inherent purpose: to show us something about the dark side of human nature. 


A DETECTIVE: whether that’s a professional, an amateur, or even the reader! It just needs to be someone with a case on their hands. A case that they are not fully prepared for (whether they realize it or not!). 
A SECRET: the key to unraveling the whole thing. What is inside the last, darkest room of our hunt for the truth? It should illuminate something about the dark side of humanity. Something we didn’t think was possible before the case began. 
A DARK TURN: the moment when the hero or detective finds themselves so deep into the mystery that their own rules, morals, and/or ethics are compromised. The hero must do something (usually in the second half of the novel) that somehow breaks the rules or threatens their integrity or even their innocence. These are the harrowing stakes of a good mystery. And the dark turn is why readers care about this particular case. Because the pull of this secret has become so strong, even the straightest arrows are helpless against it.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 11E</Title>
            <Text>The journey was filled with a mix of adventure, laughter, and a bit of chaos. As Henry’s custom car roared down the road, the landscape outside the windows shifted from the bustling city of Edenfield to the quieter, more rustic outskirts. Trees, fields, and small villages dotted the scenery, and each turn seemed to offer something new.
Jane, sitting excitedly in the back seat, was the first to break the silence with her endless curiosity. She would often point out random sights along the way, her eyes lighting up whenever something piqued her interest.
&quot;Did you say you were there when the Elven Empire fell?&quot; Jane asked, her eyes wide with excitement. &quot;How did it happen?&quot;
Catherine, seemingly delighted to have such an eager audience, launched into an impromptu history lesson about the fall of the Empire, her voice animated and full of vivid details. Meanwhile, Henry, leaning against the car, sighed dramatically. &quot;I’ll never hear the end of it,&quot; he muttered to Eddie, who just shrugged in response.
Back in the car, Catherine seemed oblivious to the time, her stories winding from one era to the next, each more fascinating than the last. The more she spoke, the more she seemed to lose track of their route.
&quot;You know, the old Elven cities along the coast were quite impressive. Have you ever heard of the city of Glyndorith? It was built into the cliffs, almost as if the mountains themselves were cradling it—&quot; she trailed off, her voice fading as she peered out the window at the passing scenery.
Henry had been navigating carefully, following the roads with confidence, but he suddenly realized that they were no longer on the main highway. &quot;Uh, Catherine, I think we missed a turn back there,&quot; he said with a raised eyebrow.
&quot;Really?&quot; Catherine said, blinking and turning back to him with a sheepish smile. &quot;Oh… I didn’t even notice.&quot;
&quot;You were too busy telling Jake and Jane about the War of the Elven Kings,&quot; Henry teased, glancing at the rearview mirror to make sure no one was too upset.
Jake and Jane, clearly thrilled by Catherine’s stories, didn’t mind at all. &quot;This is amazing!&quot; Jake said. &quot;You’ve got to tell us more about those ancient rituals! Do you know anything about the Forgotten Kings of the East?&quot;
Catherine’s eyes gleamed with excitement, and she immediately launched into a new tale, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone as she described rituals and legends that seemed to blur the lines between history and myth.
Meanwhile, Will glanced at Eddie with a grin. &quot;Well, at least we’re not bored.&quot; Eddie, however, was quietly watching the road ahead, trying to ignore the growing anxiety in his chest. He couldn’t help but wonder what lay ahead, but the lighthearted banter was a nice distraction from his worries.
Eventually, after a couple of wrong turns and some playful grumbling from Henry, Catherine realized the situation. &quot;Oh, right, we were supposed to turn left after the third sign,&quot; she said, tapping her temple as though the information had just come to her. &quot;Sorry about that, Henry.&quot;
Henry, shaking his head in mock frustration, turned the car around. &quot;I swear, this is the last time I let you distract me.&quot;
But despite the missteps, the mood in the car remained upbeat. They passed through small villages and winding roads, stopping at various places as Catherine pointed out local specialties she insisted on trying. Each time, Eddie and the others would follow along, enjoying the break and the chance to learn more about the places they were passing through. Catherine’s stories, though long-winded at times, gave them a glimpse into the past—a world so different from their own.
At one point, when the group stopped for a quick break in a small town, Catherine managed to get herself caught up in a conversation with an elderly vendor selling strange, intricately carved trinkets. While she chatted with the vendor about ancient artifacts, Jake and Jane were busy asking more questions, and Henry was starting to grow impatient.
&quot;This is going to take forever,&quot; Henry muttered under his breath, tapping the steering wheel in frustration. &quot;How long does it take to buy a trinket?&quot;
As they piled back into the car, with Catherine finally satisfied with her purchases, the drive continued with a newfound energy. It was clear that despite a few delays and detours, they were enjoying themselves, and perhaps, unknowingly, they were becoming a little more bonded with each passing moment.
But as Catherine once again took the lead in conversation, Eddie couldn’t help but feel that the journey was only just beginning. And with Catherine's unpredictable nature, there was no telling what kind of mischief—both fun and dangerous—lay ahead.
-o-
As Henry’s car continued along the winding roads, the landscape slowly changed, and what had once been a scenic countryside now gave way to the sprawling, breathtaking view of Archaea Citadel in the distance.
Eddie, who had been gazing out the window, found himself frozen in awe as they approached. Nothing in his life could have prepared him for the sight that stretched before them.
The city was like a vision out of a dream—or perhaps a nightmare. From afar, it seemed to go on for miles, the walls and spires of countless castle-like buildings rising up from the land like a series of jagged teeth. The sheer scale of it was unlike anything Eddie had ever seen. Each building seemed to be stacked upon the other, like layers of stone growing out of the earth itself. The architecture was ancient and imposing, with battlements, towers, and turrets piercing the sky in every direction.
At the very heart of the city, towering above all the other buildings, was a colossal structure—unmistakable in its grandeur. It was a massive fortress, built in concentric circles that spiraled upward, like a multi-layered cake of stone and steel. The outer walls rose in thick layers, each one seemingly supporting the next, until they reached the pinnacle where the Citadel’s keep sat. The keep itself seemed to reach far into the sky, almost touching the clouds, a dark silhouette against the pale sky. Eddie couldn’t even begin to comprehend the size of it.
Will was the first to break the stunned silence. “That... is the Citadel,&quot; he said, his voice low with disbelief. “The very center of Solivia. It’s... incredible.”
Catherine, who had been quietly watching the city approach, leaned forward in her seat and smiled faintly. &quot;It used to be even grander,&quot; she said, her voice filled with a trace of nostalgia. &quot;The Citadel, during the height of the Great Mages War, was a towering fortress, more magnificent than it seems now. It stretched over the entire mountaintop, and the walls went far higher than what remains today. But, during the battle for the Citadel, a powerful mage struck the mountain nearby, triggering a landslide that covered the lower half of the city. The landslide swallowed part of the Citadel itself.&quot;
The words sank into the group, and Eddie glanced at the others, absorbing the weight of Catherine’s story. The destruction she spoke of was unimaginable.
Catherine continued, her tone becoming more reflective. &quot;That half of the city, buried beneath the rubble, became known as the Underground City. It’s where the remnants of the old kingdom lie, forgotten beneath the stone, where the streets are haunted by history and secrets. People still live in its shadow, and the city has grown around it, but the scars of the war are still here.&quot;
Jake, who had been quietly observing, leaned forward in his seat. &quot;The Underground City? How much of it is left? Is there... a way in?&quot;
Catherine turned back to face him with a small smile. &quot;There are places, hidden under layers of stone, but they're not easily found. Few dare to dig too deep. The Citadel itself is a place of power and danger—both in its past and present.&quot;
The car picked up speed, winding through the outer roads that led closer to the Citadel, the buildings now towering over them like giants. It was clear that the city was still growing—people had built homes and shops around the remnants of the old structures, a sprawling urban labyrinth that seemed to have risen from the ruins. Streets wound between crumbling towers, their bases now swallowed up by new constructions, creating an odd mixture of ancient and modern.
“We’re almost there,” Catherine said, her eyes twinkling as she looked ahead. “Tiara’s tavern is somewhere in the suburban area. It’s outside the main walls, though, so we’ll need to pass through the outer districts.”
Eddie could hardly take in all the details. The scale of the city was overwhelming, and as they neared the outer perimeter, he noticed the shifting layers of civilization: the rich, sprawling districts near the Citadel contrasted with the more worn-down areas closer to the Underground City. The walls of the Citadel loomed ever closer, as if watching over the entire city with a silent, ancient presence.
As Henry navigated the outskirts of Archaea Citadel, the roads grew more confusing. Each twist and turn seemed to lead them deeper into an eerie, abandoned part of the city. The once-thriving town now appeared to be a ghost of its former self, the streets winding through dilapidated buildings that were mostly empty.
Eddie looked out the window, seeing crumbling structures with cracked windows, many of which had been overtaken by vines and moss. The stone roads were cracked and uneven, nature’s grip reclaiming what had once been the heart of Archaea. The street signs were barely readable, their names faded and indistinct. Some lampposts still stood, their metal frames rusted and lifeless, offering no light against the encroaching darkness of the evening. The air had a musty, forgotten quality to it, as though the town was waiting for something—or someone—to restore it to its former glory.
“Is this the right place?” Will asked from the back, his voice tinged with uncertainty.
Catherine’s gaze remained fixed ahead, though she occasionally glanced down at the faded map in her hands. “I think... I think we’re close,” she murmured, her voice trailing off. It was clear that even with centuries of experience, remembering the exact location of an old friend’s tavern was no simple task. The passing of time had muddled many of her memories, and the sheer age of the city made it harder to pinpoint her bearings.
Henry, ever patient, maneuvered the car around a tight corner. His brow furrowed slightly as he looked for any sign of the tavern. After a few moments of driving through the half-abandoned streets, Catherine finally gave a small, relieved nod. “There,” she said, pointing ahead.
As they turned the corner, Eddie caught sight of the building. Unlike the others around it, this one stood with an air of peace and warmth, almost like a small beacon in the otherwise desolate area. The stone walls were weathered but sturdy, and the flicker of light through the windows suggested life within. A simple, hand-carved sign swung above the door, its letters reading: “Cerberus Tavern.”
Henry eased the car into a large parking area in front of the tavern. It was oddly quiet, with no other cars in sight. The emptiness of the surroundings only seemed to highlight the cozy, inviting aura of the tavern, which stood firm against the deteriorating town. The contrast between the abandoned streets and the warmth of the building was striking. The tavern almost seemed to have its own life, its gentle glow standing out like a safe haven in a decaying world.
Henry parked the car and turned off the engine. There was a brief moment of silence before he looked over at Catherine. “This is it?”
Catherine nodded, a smile creeping across her face. “It’s been a while since I’ve been here, but this is Tiara’s place.”
Eddie’s curiosity piqued as he stared at the tavern, wondering just how much history was wrapped up in this seemingly simple place. They had arrived in Archaea Citadel, and now it was time to meet Tiara—the legendary Captain of the Royal Paladins, and someone who might hold the key to what lay ahead in their journey. But first, they had to step into the unknown, enter the tavern, and face whatever awaited inside.
Without a word, Eddie opened the door and stepped out of the car, followed by Will and Ashley. Henry and Catherine, too, got out, with Catherine’s steps more eager now, as though she had been waiting for this moment for far too long.
As they walked toward the entrance of the tavern, the distant echo of their footsteps seemed to match the solemn quiet of the surroundings. Eddie could feel the weight of the journey pressing down on him, but he squared his shoulders and pushed the thoughts aside. They were about to meet someone who could guide them through the perilous journey ahead, and he wasn’t about to let fear stop him now.
As the group approached the tavern, Eddie couldn’t help but feel a bit like a young squire following his knight, albeit one who didn’t quite understand the full weight of the journey ahead. Catherine, their leader in this strange, adventurous chapter, walked ahead with a sense of confidence, her presence commanding the small group behind her. Will, Ashley, Henry, Jake, and Jane all followed with their usual banter, but Eddie couldn’t shake the feeling that this was different—that they were entering a place far beyond their understanding.
Catherine stopped before the large, weathered wooden door of the tavern, its surface marked by time, with the faded &quot;Closed&quot; sign hanging in the window. Eddie glanced at it, confused. He thought they were here to meet someone, but a closed tavern didn’t seem like an ideal starting point.
Unbothered by the sign, Catherine raised her brass-mahogany alchemical staff and tapped it gently against the door. The sound echoed softly in the quiet night air, the clink of metal on wood oddly ceremonial, as if it had been done countless times before in the course of Catherine’s long life. She waited for a moment, her gaze fixed on the door, but there was no answer.
Catherine’s brow furrowed slightly, and she knocked again—this time with more insistence.
Eddie was about to ask if they should just leave when a distant voice, almost sing-songy in tone, drifted through the door. “I’m sorry,” it called, “We’re closed. We don’t serve customers at this hour.”
Catherine didn’t flinch. She simply lifted her chin slightly, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “How about an old friend?” she replied, her voice laced with an easy familiarity that sent a shiver of anticipation through Eddie’s spine. Who was this friend, and what kind of history did they share?
The door’s lock clicked, and with a creak, it slowly swung open. Standing in the doorway was a woman who, despite her warm, inviting expression, held a certain commanding presence. She was tall—taller than Catherine—and her muscular frame suggested a strength that was equal parts intimidating and reassuring. Her features were strong but gentle, with a warm smile that softened the sharpness in her eyes.
For a brief moment, Eddie wondered if the stories of her legendary status as a Captain of the Royal Paladins were true. This woman certainly looked like someone who had earned her place in history.
As her gaze fell on Catherine, her eyes brightened, and she spoke with a note of recognition in her voice. “Cathy?” she asked, her tone almost disbelieving.
Catherine’s smile grew wider, and she stepped forward, her staff held casually in her hand. “Good evening, Tia. It’s been a while.”
The two women exchanged a glance that spoke volumes. There was a history here—a deep, unspoken bond that went beyond time and distance. Eddie watched, captivated by the ease with which they greeted each other, and for a moment, he felt like an intruder on a scene he couldn’t quite understand.
But then, Tiara—who Eddie now recognized as the legendary Captain of the Royal Paladins—motioned for them to come inside. &quot;You’ve brought quite a crew with you, Cathy. I didn’t expect such a gathering tonight. Come in, come in. Let’s talk.&quot;
As they entered the tavern, Eddie couldn’t help but glance at the others—Will, Ashley, Henry, Jake, and Jane, all of whom seemed just as intrigued as he was by the interactions between Catherine and Tiara. It was clear that the day had only just begun to unravel its mysteries.
-o-
As Eddie, Will, Ashley, and the rest of the group entered the tavern, they were immediately greeted by the unexpected warmth of the space. The low hum of the fire crackled softly in the background, casting a cozy glow across the room. The smell of wood and aged spirits mixed with something earthy—perhaps herbs or spices that lingered in the air. It was the kind of place where time seemed to slow down, and the weight of history felt lighter, as if it had been turned into something comfortable and familiar.
Immediately to the right of the entrance, Eddie’s eyes were drawn to a gleaming suit of armor displayed on a mannequin. It was a shining, imposing piece of craftsmanship, adorned with intricate engravings and plumes that swirled like the winds of a battle long past. It was unmistakably the armor of a Paladin Company Captain, its polished steel glinting in the firelight. But as Eddie’s gaze swept across the room, taking in the warm, inviting atmosphere, and the woman standing before him—Tiara—he couldn’t reconcile the two.
Tiara, despite the heavy armor in the corner, looked every bit like a tavernmaid. Her welcoming smile, her easy posture, the way she moved—it was all so different from the idea Eddie had formed in his mind of the stoic, battle-hardened captain of the Royal Paladins. There was no way she was the same woman who had once commanded such an elite force.
Catherine, oblivious to the passing years and Tiara's retired status, wasted no time in introducing her. “This is Tiara,” Catherine said, gesturing to the woman with a flourish. “Captain of the Royal Paladins. She’s led expeditions to the Underground and has had her share of adventures. You wouldn’t believe the stories she could tell you about the great battles she’s fought, the lost cities she’s uncovered, and the legendary enemies she’s bested with her crew.” Catherine’s voice held the same reverence as someone speaking of a living legend. She seemed to think the world of Tiara, as though the Captain had not only been a war hero but a figurehead of an entire age.
Tiara smiled at the introduction, but there was a knowing glint in her eyes, a slight curve to her lips as she regarded Catherine and the group. “So, what is it that brings you back here after all these years?” she asked, her voice soft but tinged with suspicion. “You never visit without a reason, Cathy. What’s your game this time?”
Catherine, not one to be deterred, wasted no time getting to the heart of the matter. “It’s about Eddie,” she said, gesturing toward the young alchemy student, who had been listening quietly. “He’s in a bit of trouble—trouble with something called The Black Hand and someone named Lord Raven. I thought you might have some insights that could help.”
At the mention of The Black Hand and Lord Raven, Tiara’s warm expression faltered for just a moment, replaced by a shadow of something darker. She studied Eddie closely for a moment, her gaze sharp, before turning back to Catherine. The atmosphere in the room shifted, the jovial warmth that had filled the tavern just moments before now tainted by a palpable tension.
“I see…” Tiara muttered, her voice now carrying a weight of caution. Her eyes softened with something close to sympathy, but the underlying wariness was unmistakable. “I didn’t think we’d be talking about them again.”
As Tiara leaned against the counter, the tavern’s warm glow casting shadows on her features, her eyes grew distant. Her posture relaxed, but there was an underlying tension in the air that Eddie could feel. The memories of battles long past, the weight of the armor now only a relic in the corner, seemed to hang over her like a shroud. She met Catherine’s gaze, her expression turning somber.
“I’m retired, Cathy,” Tiara said softly, her voice firm but not without a tinge of regret. “I haven’t wielded my mace in twenty years. I no longer serve the king, and the king is dead. Together with his family.” There was a long pause, the weight of those words hanging between them. Tiara looked over her shoulder, as though the echoes of a once-glorious past were reverberating off the old wooden beams. “Now I serve this tavern, this place I’ve built. It gives me peace.”
Catherine stepped forward, her voice soft but insistent. “Tiara, you’re the one who knows the Underground like no one else. You’ve been there, fought in its depths. You’ve faced the Lord of The Black Hand before. You’re the only one who’s ever come out of there with any semblance of victory. We need your help.”
Tiara shook her head, a flicker of something—maybe bitterness, maybe nostalgia—passing through her eyes. “The Underground is a maze of madness. And the Lord of The Black Hand… He was a monster, Cathy. I don’t want to go back there. Not for you, not for anyone.” Her voice wavered for a moment, the weight of her words heavy. “I’ve found peace here, in my tavern. I’ve found something resembling calm. Why would I risk that, especially for… this?”
Catherine stood firm, a quiet intensity behind her gaze. “Because there’s more at stake now. The Black Hand isn’t just a name anymore. And Lord Raven…” She trailed off, her voice dropping with a hint of urgency. “If you don’t help us, someone might not make it out alive. And we’re just magicians. We need someone who knows how to fight, how to survive in the darkness. We need you.”
As the two women stood there, exchanging heavy words, a couple of barmen came around, setting mugs of ale and beer in front of each of the group members. The drinks were warm and inviting, offering a brief moment of comfort amidst the tension of the conversation. Eddie took a sip, the warmth spreading through his chest, but he couldn’t help but watch Tiara closely, waiting for her next words.
Tiara’s gaze lingered on the gleaming armor displayed behind the glass container, her old maces resting beside it—shiny, almost untouched. The armor gleamed under the dim tavern lights, a relic of a life she had long since abandoned. She sighed heavily, the weight of those memories pulling at her. It wasn’t just the armor, but what it symbolized—who she once was, and what she had left behind.
Catherine’s voice broke through her thoughts. “You’re afraid, Tiara,” she said gently. “Afraid to face the side of you that’s still a warrior. Afraid of what your own strength might mean.” Her eyes softened, an understanding look in them. “You’ve worked hard to tame the beast inside you, to channel your werewolf blood into something peaceful. But sometimes, Tiara, we have to remember that the strength we’ve cultivated isn’t just for ourselves—it’s for others too. Someone needs you now. Someone who can’t protect themselves.”
Tiara’s jaw tightened, her eyes flickering to the armor again, then to the group standing by the door. Eddie, Will, Ashley, and the others waited, unsure of how to intervene but silently understanding the weight of the conversation. They had heard the stories of the Royal Paladin Captain, of Tiara’s strength, her fearsome reputation. They knew what she was capable of, but they also saw the woman before them now—a woman who had chosen a different life.
But Catherine wasn’t done. Her next words made Tiara’s heart stutter, just slightly. “Madeleine. She was the girl they took. She needs you, Tiara. She needs your strength. And not just to survive, but to protect her. You’ve always protected those who couldn’t protect themselves. Even when you weren’t a knight, that’s who you were.”
The mention of Madeleine—the girl with the bright eyes and happy smile—struck Tiara deeply. It wasn’t just the word “protect,” but what it represented. She had once sworn to protect those who could not defend themselves, those in need of a knight's strength. The idea of protecting someone, of putting her strength to use again, stirred something long buried inside her.
For a long moment, Tiara stood there, frozen, as if her entire world was shifting beneath her feet. Her old instincts, those knightly values, began to rekindle, slowly burning away the doubt and the years of peace she had fought so hard to maintain. Someone needed her. Someone was depending on her—just like the people she had once sworn to defend.
Tiara stood up abruptly, her chair scraping across the wooden floor as frustration washed over her. “Damn you, Catherine,” she muttered, a fire reigniting in her eyes. “You always know what to say to make me feel like I’m walking straight back into hell.”
She turned her back to the group, her hands trembling slightly, not from fear, but from the weight of the responsibility she felt stirring once more. She had sworn off this life, but the need to protect, to fight for those who couldn’t protect themselves, was not something easily forgotten.
“Fine,” she finally said, her voice low but firm. “You win. I’ll help you. But it won’t be easy. I’m not the woman I used to be, Catherine. I haven’t been in a real fight in twenty years.” She paused for a moment, then added, “But I can’t turn my back on someone who needs me.”
She looked over at the group—Eddie, Will, Ashley, and the rest—her gaze lingering on them as though weighing her decision. “But first,” she said, her tone softening just a little, “you all need to rest. I’ll get a room ready for you all here at the tavern. You can sleep, get some food in you. Tomorrow, we begin.”
Tiara walked past Catherine, her footsteps heavy as she made her way to the back of the tavern. She needed to be alone, to gather herself, to process what had just happened. After so many years of being away from that life, she was heading back into a world she had left behind. She wasn’t sure what would come next, but she knew it wouldn’t be easy.
The barman, having overheard the conversation, stepped forward, nodding. “I’ll prepare a room for them, Tiara,” he said, his voice warm and understanding. “Let them rest.”
Tiara didn’t respond, only gave him a small nod before disappearing into the back. The heavy door to the tavern’s back room swung shut behind her with a muffled thud, leaving the group standing in silence for a moment.
The warmth of the tavern, the laughter of the patrons, and the quiet clinking of mugs around them felt distant now. They had gotten what they came for—Tiara’s reluctant agreement to help them—but the real journey was still ahead, and it would be one filled with danger and uncertainty. But for now, there was nothing to do but rest. Tomorrow would be the beginning of a new chapter in their fight against the Black Hand. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3 V2</Title>
            <Text>The storefront smelled of dried herbs and bitter roots—familiar, comforting. Glass jars lined the shelves, filled with twisted bark, gnarled mushrooms, and roots that looked more like ancient talons than medicine. The air hummed with the quiet warmth of the electric kettle boiling in the back, steam curling toward the ceiling.
Eddie sat on a wooden stool, his body a patchwork of bruises. His left eye was swollen shut, purpling at the edges. His knuckles were split, his nose crusted with dried blood. His jacket hung off him, torn at the shoulder.
Lianna moved around him with practiced efficiency, her hands steady as she dabbed a cotton pad soaked in pungent herbal tincture against his split lip. Eddie winced, but didn’t pull away.
&quot;Idiot,&quot; she muttered in, her voice sharp but her touch gentle. &quot;Fighting again. Like some street thug.&quot;
Eddie stayed silent. This wasn’t the first time he’d come home like this.
When he was younger, the bruises were from accidents—falling off his bike, tripping in the schoolyard. Then, as he got older, they came from other kids—shoulder checks in the hallway, stolen lunches, the occasional shove into a locker.
And then, last year, his father—Charles—had decided enough. He’d dragged Eddie to a martial arts class, gruffly telling him, &quot;If you’re going to get hit, at least hit back.&quot;
Lianna had called them both idiots.
Now, as she pressed a cold compress to his swollen eye, she sighed. &quot;The school called. Again.&quot;
Eddie grunted.
&quot;Three boys,&quot; she continued, switching to English, her tone clipped. &quot;One with a broken nose. One with a dislocated shoulder. And Jason Hargrove—&quot;
&quot;He deserved it,&quot; Eddie muttered.
Lianna’s fingers stilled. Then, with deliberate calm, she set down the cotton pad and folded her arms. &quot;Did he?&quot;
Eddie looked away. His mother’s stare was worse than any punch.
&quot;Your father thought teaching you to fight would make you stronger,&quot; she said. &quot;But all it did was make you angrier.&quot;
&quot;They called you a Witch,&quot; Eddie shot back, his voice rough.
Lianna paused, then let out a sharp, dismissive breath. &quot;Then let them!&quot; She turned to face him fully, her dark eyes flashing. &quot;Do you think I care what some teenagers say about me?&quot;
Eddie’s fingers curled into fists on his knees. &quot;Well, I do.&quot; The words came out quieter than he meant them to. &quot;I don’t mind if they make fun of me. But if it’s you—I’m not tolerating that.&quot;
For a moment, Lianna just looked at him—really looked at him—as if seeing something in his battered face she hadn’t noticed before. Then, without another word, she turned and walked to the shelf behind the counter, reaching for fresh gauze and a small ceramic jar of ointment.
The silence that followed wasn’t heavy. It was the kind of quiet that settled between people who understood each other too well to need filling the space.
Eddie turned.
His father stood in the doorway, still in his dockworker’s high-vis vest, his cheeks ruddy from the cold. For a moment, his face was bright—the usual tired-but-cheerful expression he wore after a long shift. Then his eyes landed on Eddie’s bruises, the split lip, the swollen eye.
&quot;Oh goodness gracious,&quot; Charles muttered, his smile vanishing. He crossed the shop in three long strides, dropping to a crouch in front of Eddie. His calloused hands hovered, as if afraid to touch. &quot;Are you okay? What happened to you?&quot;
Eddie opened his mouth, but Lianna answered first. &quot;He got into a fight. Again.&quot;
Charles exhaled through his nose, his brow furrowing. &quot;With who?&quot;
&quot;Jason Hargrove,&quot; Eddie muttered.
Recognition flashed in Charles’s eyes, followed by something darker. &quot;That little—&quot; He cut himself off, shaking his head. &quot;Did you win?&quot;
&quot;Charles!&quot; Lianna snapped.
&quot;What? I’m just asking!&quot;
Eddie almost smiled. That was Charles—practical to a fault. No scolding, no you-should-know-better. Just did you win?
&quot;Wasn't exactly a fair fight,&quot; Eddie admitted. &quot;Five against one. But they ran off in the end, so... call it a draw.&quot;
Charles opened his mouth—probably to praise him—but Lianna's sharp glare cut him off. Instead, he cleared his throat and adopted a more fatherly tone. &quot;Look, Eddie, I get it. But you can't keep solving things with your fists. Anger management, yeah? You're smarter than this.&quot;
Lianna exhaled loudly, rubbing her temples. &quot;I give up. You two are impossible.&quot; She turned and disappeared into the back of the house, the door swinging shut behind her with a decisive click.
The shop fell silent.
Charles waited a beat, then jerked his head toward the front door. &quot;Come on. Walk with me.&quot;
Eddie knew a lecture was coming. But Charles had never been the judgmental type—just blunt, honest. So he followed.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 27 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stepped into the cafeteria. The warm aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods enveloped him, mingling with fellow patrons' gentle laughter and chatter. The vibrant decor—colourful banners and enchanting murals—added to the lively atmosphere, making the space feel inviting and alive. 

He approached the counter, where a barista with a scarred face greeted him. There was something familiar about the man, though Eddie couldn't quite place it. The barista offered a friendly smile as he took Eddie's order. 

&quot;A coffee and a toast with egg, please,&quot; Eddie said, trying to keep his voice steady. 

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; the barista replied, working swiftly. As Eddie waited, he scanned the room, noticing the bright, cheerful faces around him. It starkly contrasted with the heaviness that had weighed on him before. 

When the barista placed the steaming cup and the neatly arranged toast in front of him, he gave a grateful nod. He settled at a table by the window. The sunlight streamed in, illuminating the intricate patterns of the courtyard outside. 

As he took his first sip of coffee, a warmth spread through him. He couldn't help but smile, the familiar flavours comforting him in a way he hadn't expected. 

While chewing on the toast, he glanced back at the barista, who was busy serving another customer. The man turned slightly, and Eddie saw the scar again. Something about it sparked a distant memory, but it was fleeting. Eddie shrugged it off, focusing instead on the moment—the peaceful ambience, the delicious food, and the comforting feeling of being cared for. 

As Eddie enjoyed his toast, the barista struck up a conversation. &quot;A toast with an egg? That's a specific menu choice,&quot; he said with a friendly smile. 

&quot;Yeah, I kind of got used to it,&quot; Eddie replied, taking another sip of his coffee. 

&quot;Comfort food?&quot; the barista asked, small talks. 

&quot;Yeah, it's my comfort food.&quot; Eddie nodded, feeling the warmth of the conversation. They chatted about the cafeteria's best dishes and shared a few laughs. But as Eddie leaned in to catch a better look at the man's face, something clicked in his mind. The scar and the way he spoke began to make sense. 

The café was alive with the low hum of conversations and the clinking of ceramic cups. But Eddie's world seemed to narrow as he caught sight of the barista's nametag. His heart stopped, then lurched into a wild, unsteady rhythm. 

Davies Mortimer.

The name flashed in his mind like a warning bell, dragging a cascade of memories he'd long tried to suppress. He clenched his fists, the edges of his fingernails biting into his palms as anxiety clawed at his chest. Of all people... why him? 

Eddie's stomach churned as he stood frozen. His mind racing through worst-case scenarios. Would Davies recognise him? Would he hate him for what he'd done? The scar on Davies' face had been Eddie's doing—a permanent mark of his recklessness. The shame and guilt that Eddie thought he had buried came rushing back, each thought heavier than the last. 

Summoning his courage, Eddie takes a deep breath. There was no flicker of recognition in Davies' eyes. No immediate sign that he remembered the boy who had left such a mark on him. 

&quot;Davies?&quot; Eddie's voice wavered, a mix of surprise and hesitation. 

The barista's eyebrows furrowed slightly, then lifted in polite curiosity. &quot;That's me. Can I help you?&quot; 

Eddie felt the pit in his stomach deepen. &quot;It's me—Eddie,&quot; he said, his voice softer now, almost apologetic. When that didn't register, he added, &quot;Eddie Welton.&quot; 

Davies' brow furrowed, the name not quite connecting. &quot;Sorry… Should I know you?&quot; 

Eddie felt a knot tighten in his stomach. Of course, it wouldn't be obvious—it had been years… Seven years, in fact. He swallowed hard, forcing himself to continue. &quot;We were classmates. Back at Aella Academy.&quot; 

Something flickered across Davies' face. His eyes widened slightly, the pieces finally falling into place. &quot;Wait a second…&quot; He stepped closer, leaning against the counter as realisation dawned. &quot;The Edward Welton? The guy who won the second years Alchemy Tournament?&quot; 

Eddie blinked, stunned by the sudden shift in tone. &quot;Uh, yeah. That's... me.&quot; 

&quot;Holy shit, man!&quot; Davies laughed, his voice full of genuine warmth. He stepped out from behind the counter. Arms outstretched, and clapped Eddie on the shoulder like an old friend. &quot;Man, it's been ages! I can't believe you're here!&quot; 

The tension in Eddie's chest loosened, replaced by a confusing swirl of relief and disbelief. He hadn't expected this—any of this. Where he had imagined hostility or fear, there was only friendliness. 

&quot;You remember me?&quot; Eddie asked cautiously, his voice tinged with uncertainty. 

&quot;Of course I do!&quot; Davies said, grinning. &quot;You were the top Alchemy student in our class. Everyone talked about how you were going to change the field someday. What are you up to now?&quot; 

Eddie hesitated, still grappling with the unexpected warmth of the encounter. He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. &quot;I... I'm working with my dad. At Welton's Apothecary.&quot; 

Davies' grin widened. &quot;No kidding? That place is still around? I remember hearing about it back at Aella. Your dad used to send us those fancy potions for school projects. You're lucky—you've got actual experience now.&quot; 

Eddie managed a small smile, though his mind was still reeling. &quot;Yeah, it's... it's good. A lot of work, but it keeps me busy.&quot; 

&quot;Busy is good,&quot; Davies said, leaning against the counter. &quot;And you were always one of the best. No surprise you ended up doing something with Alchemy.&quot; 

&quot;How are you, Davies?&quot; Eddie asked back. &quot;How's life for you?&quot; 

Davies shrugged, a grin spreading across his face. &quot;Can't complain. Took some time off from the academy and decided to focus on something more grounded. Turns out, brewing coffee is pretty rewarding.&quot; 

Eddie smiled but couldn't shake the feeling that their past loomed between them. &quot;I'm glad to hear that. I've... been through a lot myself.&quot; 

There is a silence 

&quot;Look, Davies…&quot; Eddie's voice cracked slightly as he broke the silence, his words coming out in a rush. &quot;I need to say this. I'm really sorry for what I did back then.&quot; 

Davies blinked, confusion flickering across his face. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; 

Eddie swallowed hard, his gaze fixed on the counter between them. &quot;The duel. Back at Aella. You know... when I—when I...” Eddie said, then gestured at the scar on his face, “When I did that.&quot; 

Davies tilted his head, a faint crease forming between his brows. &quot;Eddie, that was years ago—&quot; 

&quot;No, let me finish,&quot; Eddie interrupted, his voice tinged with desperation. &quot;I need to say this. I've carried the guilt from that day with me ever since. It was my fault. I lost control, and you—&quot; His throat tightened, and he had to pause to steady himself. 

&quot;You got hurt because of me. I've replayed it a hundred times in my head. I thought about what I could've done differently and how I should've stopped before it got that far. And... I just—I hate myself for it… I’m sorry.&quot; 

Davies' expression softened as Eddie's words spilt out. &quot;Ed—&quot; 

&quot;I thought you'd hate me… I thought everyone would,&quot; Eddie continued, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Whenever I thought about seeing you again, I imagined you'd look at me with anger, or... or fear. Whenever I passes through Aella Academy or the town of Osthaven I expected rumours, side eyes and gossips. And I wouldn't blame you, I wouldn’t blame them. I deserve that.&quot; 

Davies sighed, leaning against the counter. &quot;Eddie, look at me, man.&quot; 

Reluctantly, Eddie raised his eyes, bracing himself for the condemnation he was sure would follow. 

&quot;Yeah, it sucked,&quot; Davies said plainly, his voice steady but kind. &quot;It hurts like a bitch back then, and I was mad for a while. But I'm not mad now. We were kids. Stupid kids who didn't know better. And besides, I should've backed off too. We were both trying to prove something that didn't even matter in the grand scheme of things.&quot; 

&quot;But it wasn't your fault,&quot; Eddie interjected, guilt pooling. &quot;It was mine. I started it—&quot; 

&quot;No, Edward, I wasn't blameless either,&quot; Davies said firmly. &quot;I let my ego get the better of me, too. I pushed you. I wanted to humiliate you in front of everyone, and that's on me. And…” He hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;I hurt Markus, your friend. I knew how close you two were, and I went to rile him up just to get to you. That was low, and I'm sorry for that. I should've never dragged him into it.&quot; 

Eddie's eyes widened at the admission, his guilt momentarily giving way to surprise. &quot;You don't have to apologise for that—&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I do,&quot; Davies interrupted gently. &quot;Markus didn't deserve that, and neither did you. I was a cocky fucking jerk back then, and I hurt people just to feel like I was on top. I regret it. Just as much as you might have regretted what happened in that duel.&quot; 

Eddie's shoulders sagged, the knot in his chest loosening slightly. &quot;I don't know what to say. I thought... I thought you'd hate me. I was sure you'd never want to see me again.&quot; 

Davies gave a small, rueful laugh. 

&quot;I did hate you. For a little while, anyway. But you're not the same kid you were back then, are you? Neither am I. Life's too short to hold grudges.&quot;  He lets out a chuckle, “Grudges will prevent you from brewing good coffee.”

Eddie looked up, chuckling. &quot;You're a better person than I am. I've spent years avoiding my past, fearing what I'd find if I faced it.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Davies said, clapping Eddie on the shoulder with a grin, &quot;sounds like you're facing it now. That's a start, isn't it?&quot; 

&quot;I... I don't know what to say,&quot; Eddie admitted, his voice thick. 

Davies grinned, clapping Eddie on the shoulder. &quot;How about 'thanks for not spitting in my coffee'? Or better yet, 'thanks for making it extra strong'?&quot; 

Eddie let out a shaky laugh, the tension in his chest easing just a fraction. &quot;Thanks for not spitting in my coffee,&quot; he said, his voice lighter now, “But no, it’s not strong enough, Davies.”

&quot;Screw you Welton.&quot; Davies laughed. &quot;Now, how about we catch up properly? Tell me what you've been up to since the academy.&quot; 

&quot;Well, for starters,&quot; Eddie began, rubbing the back of his neck, &quot;I'm not at Aella anymore.&quot; 

Davies raised an eyebrow. &quot;Not at the academy? Where are you now? Don’t say you just spend the last seven years brewing potions?”

Eddie laughed, feeling more at ease. &quot;Yeah, well, I wouldn't exactly say I'm blowing things up anymore. But I guess it's... it's quieter. More grounded.&quot; 

&quot;Good for you,&quot; Davies said, nodding. &quot;Sounds like you've found a path that works for you.&quot; 

&quot;Sort of…&quot; Eddie's smile faltered for a moment. He remembered his struggles with his magic, but he quickly pushed it aside. &quot;Actually, a few days ago, I had a visitor. An elf—she's a little... eccentric, but she's been a big help. I guess she was looking for something... a lost piece of history or magic. Some ancient codex or something. She's kind of a wanderer.&quot; 

Davies raised an eyebrow, intrigued. &quot;An elf, huh? Sounds like she left quite an impression,&quot; 

At that moment, Davies leaned in, his grin widening. &quot;Oh, and by the way, Eddie,&quot; he said, a teasing glint in his eyes. &quot;A lady with red hair said that if I met a guy with white hair and green eyes, I should ask him to meet her in the courtyard. You reckon it was you?&quot; 

Eddie's heart skipped a beat as he processed the information. &quot;Catherine? What is she doing here?&quot; 

Davies raised an eyebrow, clearly piecing things together. &quot;Wait... red hair, green eyes? Yeah, that sounds like her. She had sharp ears too, didn't she? Must've been the elf you're talking about.&quot; 

Eddie nodded. Feeling a slight weight lift from his shoulders as he confirmed Davies' realisation. &quot;Yeah, that sounded like Catherine.&quot; 

Davies' expression shifted to one of mild concern. &quot;Huh. That explains a lot. She was in the cafeteria earlier this morning and had a sling on her arm—it wasn't hard to spot her. Then she left pretty suddenly and said she was heading to the courtyard. That was a couple of hours ago, though.&quot; 

Eddie's stomach clenched at the thought of her alone out there, especially after everything. &quot;She... broke her arm?&quot; he asked, his voice tinged with worry. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Davies said, shrugging. &quot;Seemed like she might've hurt it. But she didn't look too upset, just—well, you know—distracted, like something else was on her mind.&quot; 

Eddie's mind raced. He couldn't shake the image of Catherine alone in the courtyard, nursing an injury. &quot;Is she okay? Should I go check on her?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, she seemed fine enough,&quot; Davies replied, his tone softening. &quot;But, uh, sounds like she could use a friend. Probably a good idea to go meet her.&quot; 

Eddie hesitated for a moment, his concern for Catherine growing stronger. &quot;I... I should go. Thanks for telling me, Davies.&quot; 

&quot;No problem,&quot; Davies said, giving him a nod. &quot;Take care of her, Eddie. Sounds like you've got some catching up to do.&quot; 

Eddie stood up, his resolve solidifying. With a wave, he approached the door, a new sense of purpose guiding him as he headed to the courtyard. The lingering warmth of their conversation bolstered him, reminding him that change was possible—not just for Davies but for him, too. 

As Eddie reached for the door, a voice called out from behind him. &quot;Hey, Eddie!&quot; 

He turned, seeing Davies leaning against the counter, a grin tugging at his lips. &quot;If you're considering continuing to university, choose Alchemy! You've got a real knack for it!&quot; 

Eddie blinked, surprised by the words. But the compliment made his chest swell with something between pride and guilt. He gave Davies a slight nod, feeling a spark of encouragement. &quot;Thanks! I'll keep that in mind.&quot; 

With that, Eddie stepped out of the cafeteria and into the hallway. The vibrant atmosphere of the hospital still buzzed around him. As he approached the courtyard, gentle laughter and the soft splashing of water from the central fountain grew clearer. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 12 V2</Title>
            <Text>The wooden creak and clacking of horse hoofs filled the journey after Eddie, Torrie, Markus and Catherine boarded the carriage that agreed to take them to Gunther’s Farm, that is the northernmost point the carriage is willing to take them.
Scents of hay and the faint earthy breeze drifting through the open sides of the carriage. Eddie sat quietly, his gaze fixed on the passing fields, The rifle sat leaning on his shoulder. Catherine, ever the scholar, kept stealing glances at the weapon. Finally, her curiosity got the better of her. 
Catherine then reaches her hand to touch one of the engravings.
But as usual, Eddie swatter her hands away.
“Come on, Edward.” Catherine sighed, “Can’t I get just a little touch of it?”
“No, Catherine.” Eddie reminded, “Dad said so.”
“Humph,” Catherine said in mock pout, “Have it your way then.”
Markus and Torrie laughed at the exchange, but Catherine is far from over, she continued,
&quot;But I've been meaning to ask about that flintlock of yours. It's not exactly what you see every day, especially for someone helping out at the apothecary.&quot; 
&quot;It's more of a hand-me-down, I guess,&quot; he sighed, &quot;Back when Weshaven was still full of Streamwyrms, Dad taught my brother Alfred how to use it. Alfred would go into the shore with the others and scare off anything too close to the Apothecary. Sometimes, he'd even shoot them if they were too bold.&quot; 
“Streamwyrms? What’s that?” Torrie asked,
“It’s those fishes coming out of the shores every August, remember? Sharp teeth, four legs, you were almost bitten by one last summer.”
“Oh those!” Torrie said, “But they are so cute, why did Alfred shoot them?”
“No they aren’t cute, Torrie, they’re pest!” Eddie hissed
Catherine tilted her head, her gaze flicking back to the rifle. &quot;And now? I assume there aren't any Streamwyrms around anymore.&quot; 
&quot;Not really,&quot; Eddie replied. &quot;They still comes out of the shores every August, since Alfred’s not around, I takes his place, but honestly Markus was much more better shot than me, so I haven't had to use this thing in ages. Honestly, it's just been collecting dust.&quot; 
&quot;So why bring it now?&quot; Catherine pressed, a note of curiosity creeping into her tone. 
“Eh,” Eddie shrugged. &quot;Because it's cool.&quot; 
“You just said that Robert asked you to take it.” Catherine said
“But it’s still cool nonetheless.”
“Since it’s oh so cool,” Catherine said theatrically, “You would let me touch them.”
“No!”

-o-

The carriage came to a slow, creaking halt in front of a farmstead, a modest property framed by sprawling fields and a weathered wooden fence. The farmhouse stood stoically against the horizon, its roof patched in places and its walls bearing the marks of years spent braving the elements. A few chickens scattered at the sound of the wheels stopping, clucking indignantly as the group prepared to step down.
The driver gave the reins a gentle flick. “Here we are. Gunther’s Farm. Northernmost point, just like I said.”
Eddie was the first to hop off, his boots crunching against the dirt path as he turned to help Torrie down. She leaped with an exaggerated flourish, as if pretending she were dismounting a noble steed. Markus followed, stretching his arms and squinting at the farm with mild curiosity. Catherine climbed down last, brushing her red coat off with an air of elegance—until the driver called out.
“Right, miss. That’ll be two silver for the lot of you.”
Catherine froze mid-motion, her hand lingering in her pocket as she turned to the driver with a sheepish smile. “Ah… I think…”
The driver looked more unamused.
“I… seem to have misplaced my coin satchel…” Catherine said, her voice uncharacteristically hesitant. She glanced back at the group. “Eddie, darling,” she said, flashing an overly sweet smile. “Be a dear and lend me a bit, would you?”
Eddie looked at Catherine, seemingly taken aback by her uncharastically sweet and regal tone.
“What.” Eddie said
“I misplaced my coin purse.”
“You spent all your coins didn’t you—“
“I said I misplaced it. Happens to the best of us, you know.” 
Eddie reluctantly dug into his pouch, fishing out two silver coins and handing them to the driver, who nodded in thanks and clicked his tongue to set the horses moving again.
As the carriage rolled away, Eddie turned to Catherine. “You’re a master alchemist, and you don’t have two silver to your name?”
“Exactly,” Catherine said, “Also I’m not just a Master Alchemist, Edward. I’m a Travelling Master Alchemist, and that is why I accepted that gig!.”
“I sometimes wonder how my younger self could even idolise you—“
“Hey!”
The shout was coarse and sharp. Eddie froze mid-step, his hand instinctively reaching for the flintlock. Ahead, emerging from the hedgerow, was a figure silhouetted by the blinding sun. Short and stocky, the silhouette loomed, holding what looked like a flintlock—but this one was modified, its barrel adorned with a menacing axe head, gleaming in the harsh light. 
“You’re trespassing!” the voice barked. Gravelly, harsh, and unwavering. “Turn around and leave, or I swear I’ll send you running with a warning shot!”
Eddie’s heart pounded in his chest. He stepped slightly in front of Torrie, shielding her from the figure’s view. 
“Wait,” Markus said, his voice calm but firm as he raised his hands. “Easy there! We’re just passing through, not looking for trouble.”
The barrel didn’t waver. So does the figure.
“Stay where you are!” the voice barked. “I don’t trust a word out of you lot. Get the hell off, or things’ll get ugly!”
Catherine stepped forward, her hands slightly raised. “Hey, no need to get aggressive,” she said with forced composure. “We’re just passing by. We don’t mean you any harm.”
The figure’s flintlock muzzle flicked slightly, now pointing toward Eddie. “Then why’s that bugger got his hand on his piece, eh? You think you’re quicker than me, son? Go on. Try it.”
Eddie’s grip tightened on the flintlock, his palm slick with sweat. His throat was dry, his eyes fixed on the dark figure ahead. Every muscle in his body screamed at him to act, but the uncertainty held him in place. Torrie clung to the back of his coat, her breathing quick and shallow.
“E-Eddie?” Torrie said, trembling.
“It’s alright,” Eddie said, trying to be composed.
“I’ll lower mine,” the figure growled, “if he lowers his. Right now.”
A tense silence, the only sound the faint rustle of the wind through the hedges. Eddie’s eyes darted to Catherine, waiting for her to say something, to do something. It’s a standoff, and as the figure said… It might get ugly.
“Wait a second…” Catherine said
Catherine’s head tilted, her eyes narrowing as she peered closer at the figure. Slowly, her lips parted, and her tense expression gave way to incredulous disbelief. 
“Gunther?” 

“How’d you know me bloody name—“ The figure stopped himself. Then finally lowers his flintlock, Eddie sighed a breath of relief, he then lowered his.

The figure walked down the hedge, as the sunlight finally hits him, he could see the man. He was short, burly, has a very thick beard.

“I’d be damned… Catherine the Elf?” 

“It’s been a while, Gunther Aelfric.” Catherine smiled
“Well, isn’t this a surprise,” Gunther said, leaning his flintlock-axe against the fence post as he scratched his scruffy chin. “Catherine, back on Weshaven after… what, five years? Ten? What are ya up to these days? Still going off that treasure hunts of yours?”
“Fifteen,” She answered, “I just meant to stop by, and as you assumed, yes I’m looking after an artefact on the forest up north.”

“Uh-huh.” Gunther’s smile softened, his eyes glinting with genuine warmth. “Well, it’s good to see you again, Kate. Been too long.”
His gaze then shifted to the rest of the group, his brows furrowed slightly. His sharp eyes lingered on Eddie and Torrie, then dropped to the flintlock Eddie had on his back. Gunther’s expression shifted from curiosity to recognition.
“Hold on.” He squinted, leaning slightly closer. “That flintlock… that’s Robert Welton’s.”
“Umm, yeah.” Eddie instinctively placed a hand over the weapon. “It is,” he said carefully.
“I’ll be damned,” Gunther muttered, his eyes widening as he stepped back. “You’re his boy, aren’t you? And her, too—” he pointed at Torrie with a weathered hand. “Robert’s kids. Eddie and… uh…”
“Torrie,” she said brightly, stepping forward.
“Of course. Eddie and Torrie.” Gunther chuckled, shaking his head in disbelief. “Well, I’ll be. Last time I saw you two, you were knee-high and causing mischief while your pa and I talked shop.”
“You knew our dad?” Eddie asked, a faint note of surprise in his voice.
“Knew him? Course I did.” Gunther’s hand waved toward the flintlock. “Made that beauty for him meself. Custom order—Robert said he wanted something reliable but sharp enough to scare off those pesky Streamwyrm coming off the shore. That weapon’s got some history, I tell ya.”
Gunther then gestured toward the farmhouse behind him. “You lot must’ve come all the way from Mariner’s Reach. That’s a long trek just to stop by my place. You’re not thinkin’ of heading straight into the northern forest without even catching your breath, are you?”
“Well, we were—” Catherine said
“Not a chance. Not on my watch.” He jabbed his thumb toward the farmhouse. “Come on, let’s get you some food. A hot meal and a proper rest’ll do you good. Besides…” His grin turned mischievous. “I wanna hear all about whatever wild goose chase Catherine’s dragged you into this time.”
“Why do you always assume it’s me?” Catherine said, annoyed.
“Because it’s always you, Kate. Now come on.” Gunther said with a wink, already turning toward the farmhouse.

CODEX SUBPLOT
Eddie met with the two scholars named Aenid and Hadir, they recognised him from Weshaven, and talked about the codex they got from Catherine. One of them argues that it might be Necromancy, but the other argues otherwise, 

	The scholars argues that no form of Magical Branch can seemingly do the technique described in the Codex, either they needed a Spellcraftsman to construct a new spell system to cast the spell described in the Codex, or else, they needed someone that can perform and understood Ancient Magic, which is debatable, since nobody would be alive today to know such a thing, not even Master Katarina

At the end, Eddie is going to steal the codex to learn the magic of Animation, that is breathing life or an illusion of life into something. But the magic of Animation is either taboo or forbidden, and it is said that the technique lies in the Codex Chilandar, the one codex kept secret by the Two Scholars

            <Title>Chapter 2E</Title>
            <Text>The bus groaned. It buzzed faintly beneath the floorboards like a nest of bees, accompanied by the rhythmic squeaking of the old suspension every time they hit a bump.
The seats creaked whenever someone shifted their weight. Somewhere near the back, a bolt was loose—it rattled faintly with every turn.
Overhead, the air conditioner wheezed out cool air in pitiful, uneven bursts. It clicked now and then, like it was trying to restart itself but kept giving up. 
The whole vehicle smelled faintly of dust and dried grass. 
Eddie sat near the window, his crutch propped beside him, fingers loosely gripping the handle. The metal of it was warm to the touch from sitting in the sunlight. His leg ached dully from the vibrations in the floor.
It was a week after his admission to Edenfield Infirmary, the nurses decided to let him go, since he looked more fine than ever, (and with Ashley and Will visiting too often, it gets really rowdy) and so he did.
Outside, the usual bustle of Edenfield gave way to open fields. The noise of city life—the chatter of street vendors, the distant clanging of bells, the squeals of tram brakes—had long since faded, replaced by the subtle hum of wind brushing over fields.
He leaned against the cool windowpane and let his eyes drift to the hills outside.
Yellow wildflowers dotted the landscape, swaying gently like dancers in a slow procession. He recognized them now—Eden Flowers. Rare, beautiful. Rumored to be the city’s namesake.
Eddie had read about them recently in a book Will tossed aside in their dorm room. They only grew on the eighth continent, and some believed they were the reason the city was called Edenfield. A field of paradise. A hopeful name, for a city so full of hidden things.
The note crinkled faintly in his hand as he turned it over again.
21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground. Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.
Madeleine’s handwriting was neat, almost too neat—like every letter had been shaped with care.
He could’ve ignored it.
Finals were over. Will was back to plucking wild solos on his electric guitar with the campus band. Ashley had thrown herself into her advocacy group again, fighting for student protections and probably brewing some conspiracy after everything that happened to him.
He could’ve gone back to the Book Pirates, argued about the latest book they’d smuggled in from the restricted section. He’d even drafted a rant about the plot holes in The Alchemist’s Mirror.
And yet, here he was.
Why?
Because of a hunch? Because of that thing that chased him—crawling on all fours with arms too long and a face that didn’t look human?
Or maybe because of her.
He let out a slow breath and leaned his head against the window. The glass was warm.
She’d been patient with him. Even when she caught him that one time—slipping a book from the library.
Who was he kidding?
She was kind to everyone. That was just who she was.
Eddie looked outside again. The golden fields had started to thin. In their place, narrow rivers carved winding paths through the land, glinting in the sunlight like veins of silver. Trees—tall, broad, and old—appeared more frequently now, rising from mossy rocks and thick underbrush. Their branches cast flickering shadows that danced across the windows as the bus rattled along the dirt path.
The road dipped and groaned under the weight of the vehicle. Somewhere beneath Eddie’s seat, a loose panel clattered like it might fall off. Still, he kept his eyes forward.
The bus finally creaked to a stop before a worn wooden cabin that sat nestled beneath a wide oak tree. A crooked sign swung gently in the breeze above the door.
Norwood Campgrounds.
Eddie looked at the paper again, unfolding it like he hadn’t memorized every inch of it.
21st Norwood Street, past the campground.
Right, this must be it.
With a grunt, he pressed a hand to the metal frame of the seat in front of him and hoisted himself up. His leg protested instantly, a deep throb radiating from his thigh down to his ankle. He hissed through his teeth.
The aisle felt narrower than usual. He shuffled past the rows of empty seats, his hand dragging along the backs of them for balance, his body swaying with the uneven ground beneath the bus.
Gravel crunched under his foot. The scent of pine hit him immediately—strong, earthy, and damp. Somewhere nearby, birds were chirping, and the wind whistled gently through the leaves like a whisper.
Eddie took a few slow steps forward, scanning the area. Past the bus stop and Norwood Campgrounds cabin, there wasn’t much—just a scattering of wooden buildings, most of them locked up, a picnic table or two, and a lonely clothesline swaying in the breeze. Beyond that, just trees. Trees and shadows. Tall and thick, the kind that swallowed noise and direction.
He turned the note over in his hand again.
“Past the campground,” it said.
Past where? Eddie thought. Left of the mossy rock? Right at the griffin statue?
He made his way toward one of the cabins where a man in green coveralls and a wide-brimmed hat was fiddling with a hose.
“Excuse me,” Eddie said, approaching. “Do you know where Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary is? Should be somewhere near here.”
The man scratched his chin. “Creature Sanctuary?” He turned his head and spat thoughtfully. “Think that’s north. Up past the creek. Or south, maybe. Can’t remember. My cousin swore he saw a griffin there once. Or a deer. Could’ve been a deer.”
Eddie blinked. “Right. Thanks.”
He asked two more people—one of them pointed down a trail that led nowhere, the other looked confused and said it didn’t exist at all. Ten minutes passed. Maybe fifteen. He was sweating now, leaning heavier on his crutch, irritation mounting.
He came to a slow stop by a large oak tree, breathing hard. His leg was sore, his shirt was sticking to his back, and he was starting to wonder if this had all been a mistake. Maybe Madeleine had been joking. Or testing him. Or maybe—
“Edward!”
The voice cut through the woods like a warm gust of air. He froze, eyes scanning the brush and the winding paths around him.
Again, “Edward!”
He turned just in time to see a figure emerging between two trees—wavy red hair catching the sunlight like a flicker of fire, arms waving above her head.
Madeleine.
She jogged toward him, boots thudding softly against the dirt path, a wide smile on her face.
“You made it!” she called, beaming.
Before he could say anything, Madeleine wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug.
“Agh—bloody—my leg!” Eddie winced, half-laughing, half-wheezing.
Madeleine immediately pulled back, her eyes wide. “Oh no! I’m so sorry—I didn’t know you were still healing!”
He waved it off, trying to catch his breath. “No, no, it’s fine—just… It’s still there y’know?”
Madeleine frowned, looking genuinely guilty. “You should’ve waited a few more days. Seriously. You didn’t have to come limping through the woods for this.”
“What can I say, I couldn’t wait to see the dragons,” Eddie said dryly, expecting an eye-roll or a sarcastic jab in return.
Instead, Madeleine glanced ahead and replied, matter-of-factly, “They’re currently under intensive care. One of them had a wing injury and the hatchling’s still in containment, so I’m afraid you won’t be able to see them today.”
Eddie chuckled. Then paused. “Wait… you’re serious?”
Madeleine looked at him with a raised brow, half-smiling. “You’re in the Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary, Eddie. Come on. You haven’t seen anything yet.”
She turned and started walking again, parting the overgrown trail with her hands. Eddie followed, crutch tapping against root and soil.

-o-

They followed a narrow path through the woods, barely more than a trail beaten down by time and boots. The trees arched overhead like ancient guardians, their branches laced with moss, the sunlight filtering through in golden slants. The silence of the woods was complete—except for the occasional chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves, and now and then, a distant, eerie wail from deeper in the forest.
Eddie glanced toward the sound but didn’t say anything for a while. Then, as they passed a moss-covered log, he finally asked, “So… how long have you been doing this? The Sanctuary thing.”
Madeleine stepped over a root before answering, “Since my first year.” Her voice was calm, nostalgic. “I signed up as a volunteer the moment I arrived in Edenfield. But to be honest, it started long before that.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “You grew up around magical creatures?”
“You could say that,” she said with a small laugh. “But not exactly, I was obsessed with them. Always reading about them. Drawing them. Pretending I had one hidden under my bed.” She slowed her pace a little, eyes scanning the path ahead. 
“There was one time,” She continued, “When I was maybe eight or nine—me and two of my best friends were playing by the creek near my place. We stumbled on this injured hatchling. Tiny thing. Could barely stand. It must’ve gotten separated from its pack.”
Eddie listened, the rhythmic thud of his crutch tapping the dirt between her words.
“We couldn’t tell our parents,” she continued. “They’d have made us give it up right away. Said it was too dangerous. So we took turns sneaking out food and blankets. One of us would always be on watch while the others fed it and tend to its wing.”
“It took almost a year.” She smiled, “But one day, it just stood up, flapped its wings, and took off. Just like that. No warning. No goodbye. Just gone.”
“Didn’t that… I don’t know… Hurt?” Eddie asked.
“What do you mean?” Madeleine asked back.
“I don’t know…” Eddie said, “Taking care of something for almost a year. You must’ve grown attached to that thing, you know?”
Madeleine shook her head. “Some people say letting go is painful. But I didn’t feel that. It’s just that the feeling I felt finally seeing them fly again outweights the feeling I felt when they left. Seeing it soar… If felt as if we did something good, and that was enough.”
They walked in silence for a few more steps.
Eddie looked at her. “That’s a lot of heart for an eight-year-old.”
“It wasn’t heart.” Madeleine smiled at him. “It was hope.”
They walked for some time, the path narrowing until it became little more than a trail of flattened leaves and twisted roots. Eventually, Madeleine veered off the track, motioning for Eddie to follow her. He hesitated for a moment, then sighed and limped after her into a quiet clearing surrounded by towering trees.
At the far end of the clearing stood two trees unlike any Eddie had seen before. They were impossibly tall, ancient, their gnarled trunks wide enough to fit a whole bus between them. Roots like thick ropes coiled at their bases, and their dark green canopies loomed high above the rest of the forest like silent sentinels.
Eddie stood in the middle of the clearing, taking in the sheer scale of them.
Madeleine, meanwhile, walked toward the space between the trees. She paced to and fro in front of them, scanning the area.
“What are you doing?” Eddie called.
Madeleine squinted at the ground, then up at the trunks. “Someone must’ve closed the gate.”
“The what?”
She turned to him. “Did you bring a wand?”
Eddie scoffed. “I’m an Alchemy student. We don’t really do wands.”
She winced. “Right. Of course. I don’t have mine either.”
With a resigned sigh, Madeleine stepped up to one of the trees and began patting the bark, feeling around the grooves like someone searching for a hidden latch. After a few moments, she let out a soft “Ah-ha!” and pulled something free from a hollow in the bark.
It was a staff—twisted wood woven into a lattice, with a simple, clouded crystal embedded at the top. The whole thing looked as if it had grown that way.
Madeleine approached the first tree and tapped it once with the staff. Then she crossed over to the other and did the same.
Finally, she returned to Eddie’s side, held the staff upright, and brought its base down against the earth with a soft thunk.
At first, nothing happened.
Then, high above, something stirred.
Eddie looked up just in time to see a thick branch from one tree curl inward like a bending arm. The other tree responded in kind. The two branches reached across the empty space between them and interlocked, forming a curved archway of living wood.
And beneath that arch, the world changed.
Where moments ago there had only been trees and brambles, now stood an open expanse of green fields stretching gently toward the horizon. A wooden fence traced the edge of a nearby pasture, and beyond it were low cabins with mossy roofs, a few smoke trails curling lazily from chimneys. The scent of hay and something vaguely sulfurous wafted from the invisible threshold.
Eddie blinked. “That’s… new.”
Madeleine grinned. “Welcome to the Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.”

            <Text>The door towards the garage creaked open, the lights from the main room streaked through as Eddie paced his way inside.
The garage was dimly lit, the only light coming from a small lantern hanging above the workbench. It smelt of old wood, tools and equipment lined the walls. A rusty beaten-down car sat on the corner, the automobile definitely hadn’t ran for ages. The sounds of metal clinking and leather straps fastened filled the space as he checked and rechecked each item with meticulous care.
&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; Eddie muttered under his breath. His fingers ran over bandoliers, satchels, and tools he hadn't touched in years. 
Eddie’s eyes landed on one particular satchel, a worn leather satchel that he hasn’t touched in years.
He took the satchel and opened it.
He adjusted the straps of a worn leather satchel. &quot;An illusory forest,&quot; he scoffed. &quot;Because, sure, Catherine, that’s exactly where I want to take Torrie. Nothing says 'quality family time with Markus' like trudging through a place that’s basically a trap pretending to be nature. Brilliant idea.&quot;
His hands moved faster now, checking the buckles. 
&quot;And she just assumes we’ll be fine. No map, no plan, just a wave of her hand and a 'Oh, it’ll be fine! It's perfectly safe!' Perfectly safe, my arse. Since when is anywhere safe when it’s been illusory forest to confuse you, lure you into dead ends, or worse? What next? A quick detour into a cave full of angry wyverns? Maybe invite a banshee for tea while we’re at it?&quot;
The lantern above him swayed slightly, casting jittery shadows on the walls as his agitation grew. 
&quot;She doesn’t even think about this stuff, does she? Of course not. It's all, 'Eddie, you’re overreacting!' Overreacting? When I’m the one who has to make sure Torrie doesn’t get eaten by whatever it is lurking in the bushes.&quot;
The satchel finally settled into place with a heavy thud, and he reached for a pair of gloves, inspecting them for wear. 
&quot;And Markus—poor Markus—dragged into this because he just happened to be standing there when Catherine got this harebrained idea. What was he going to say? 'No, thanks, I’d rather not risk my life today'? She doesn’t exactly leave room for discussion, does she?&quot;
He exhaled sharply, the sound halfway between a sigh and a growl, and raked his fingers through his hair. &quot;Ridiculous. Absolutely, unequivocally ridiculous.&quot;
As the heavy door creaked open, Eddie spun around, expecting Catherine or, worse, Torrie coming to ask some inane question about how much longer he was going to be. 
Instead, it was Mr. Robert Welton.
“Oh hey there, Son.” Robert chuckled, on his sides are satchels filled with alchemical ingredients, he goes to one of the workbench and settle it down, it settles with a very heavy thud. He then looked at Eddie, “What’re you up to?”
“It’s just…” Eddie said, his hands scraping the leather of his satchel, “Catherine.”
“Catherine?” Robert raised his eyebrow. “Oh are you going to your little adventures?”
“Well, maybe a little is an understatement.” Eddie chuckled, leaning to one of the workbench, “She also invited Torrie and Markus.”
“A big party?!” Robert whistled, walking towards Eddie and pats him in the back “You guys got  a big adventure ahead of ya!”
“Yeah, I suppose we are.” Eddie chuckled
“Stay safe, son.” Robert finally said
“I will, dad.” Eddie said, putting his satchel on, and walking towards the door. But before he could turn and twist it.
“Eddie.” Robert called
“Yes, dad?”
“Are you going to take your ring with you?”
Eddie stood there, looking below.
“No, I gave the ring to Torrie years ago.”
“I see.” Robert said, his expression becoming more sombre, “Then come here for a sec.”
Eddie then walked from the door, joining his father on the workbench.
“It should be somewhere around here…” Robert said, rummaging through his chest, taking out all sort of tools, hammers, fishing rods, axes, until
“Ah, there she is!” Robert said in glee, and from the chest, there is a Flintlock Rifle
“Alfred’s gun?” Eddie said, raising his eyebrow.
“My gun, before I gave this to Alfred, and since he is away overseas nobody has used it ever since.” Robert said
“And what do you want me to do with it?” 
“Let’s see whether you still know how to use ‘em.” He said, then tossing the rifle to Eddie, in which he catches it. “Go on, do you still remember how to load the thing?”
Eddie reached for a small metal ball from the other satchel without a word, loading the flintlock with practised ease. His movements were fluid and confident as if the muscle memory had never left him. He secured the powder, placed the ball in the barrel, and snapped the mechanism into place. When he finished, he looked up at his father. 
Robert smiled. &quot;Alright, I suppose you still remember. I'd rather you take your ring with you, but if you insist on not using it, at least you can defend yourself. Now disengage it, Edward.&quot; 
Eddie then slinged Alfred’s rifle on his back, then took the other satchel, containing gun powders and metal balls. &quot;Yeah, I suppose so.&quot; 
There was a brief silence, the weight of unspoken words hanging between them. Finally, Robert clapped his hand on Eddie's shoulder, his grip firm. &quot;Alright then. Be safe out there, Ed. Keep Torrie safe out there, alright?&quot;
Eddie met his father's gaze, the flintlock resting comfortably at his gack. &quot;I sure will.&quot;
As Robert turned to leave, Eddie watched him go, feeling the rifle's weight in his hands. It wasn't the same as carrying a wand, but perhaps that was the point. The door closed behind his father with a soft thud, leaving Eddie alone in the garage's quiet. 

-o-

	Eddie stepped out of the garage, Flintlock rifle slung across his back and two satchels secured at his sides, one leather, containing his personal stuff, the other is a canvas satchel, containing his ammunition. The morning air was cool, slightly obscured by the morning fog. Muted grey painted the sky. Outside, Catherine and Torrie stood near the low stone wall overlooking the sea, Catherine is leaning on the stone wall. Their figures bathed in the fading light. 
	Torrie, her eyes wide with excitement, was practically bouncing on her heels as she bombarded Catherine with a flurry of questions about magic. Her silver-jade conduit ring bouncing on her metal chains on her neck as she talk. 
	&quot;Catherine, Catherine! Could you transmute copper into gas if you added enough heat and pressure? Or would it just destabilize like Eddie’s brilliant idea last week? You know, the one that nearly made the whole living room smell like burnt hair and vinegar for days?&quot;
	&quot;Well, Torrie, theoretically, yes, you could, but transmuting metals on that scale requires an extraordinary amount of precision—far more than most Alchemists can safely handle. And Eddie’s experiment wasn’t entirely off-base,&quot; she added with a faint smile, glancing at him. 
	Markus, meanwhile, leaned casually against the stone wall. His gaze fixed on the sea as the waves gently lapped against the shore below. He looked up as Eddie approached, a grin spreading across his face.
	&quot;All set, Ed?&quot; Markus asked. Pushing himself off the wall.
	Eddie nodded. &quot;Yeah, I'm ready.&quot; 
	As Eddie joined them, Catherine's eyes were drawn immediately to the rifle on his back. Her brows furrowed in surprise, a stark contrast to the warm smile she had been wearing. &quot;Eddie, what is that?&quot; 
	“Dad asked me to carry it.” Eddie said, straightening the flintlock on his back, “For protections, of course.”
	“Why not use your usual ring?” Catherine said
Eddie stood there, “I uhh,”
“Eddie gave the ring to me.” Torrie said, “I’ll be using the ring.”
“Well that’s a disappointment,” Catherine sighed. She studied him longer, searching for the boy she remembered in the man before her. &quot;I see... Well, I suppose a bit of extra protection never hurt anyone.&quot; 
She then stepped closer, her scholarly curiosity piqued. &quot;May I?&quot; she asked, touching the rifle. 
Eddie quickly swatted her hand away, a playful smile tugging at his lips despite his tension. &quot;No, can't do, Ma'am. Dad said nobody else should touch it besides me and my brother Alfred.&quot;
Catherine pouted. Folding her arms, sulking playfully. &quot;Hmph, and here I thought I'd get to examine something new. Very well, I suppose I'll just have to content myself with the mysteries of the Deep Glaive.&quot;
Torrie giggled at the exchange, and even Markus couldn't help but chuckle. Eddie shook his head, still smiling, as he adjusted the strap of his satchel.
Catherine regained her usual demeanour, though a hint of amusement lingered in her eyes. &quot;Alright, let's get going. The Deep Glaive waits for no one.&quot;
The group began to make their way down the path leading away from the house. Catherine walked at the front, her staff clicking rhythmically against the cobblestones. Torrie followed closely behind, practically skipping with every step. Markus and Eddie brought up the rear, with Eddie casting one last glance back at the house where his father stood watching from the doorway.
Mr and Mrs Welton raised a hand in a silent farewell, his expression a mix of pride and concern. Eddie returned the gesture before turning away.

            <Title>Chapter 18 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>“I had no idea…” Catherine voice barely rose above a whisper. “Eddie never spoke about it. I’ve always wondered why he seemed so distant.”
Markus let out a slow breath, his shoulders sagging. “It was a turning point for him. He became cold—cut off from everything he was passionate about. From that point on, he believed Alchemy was black magic. He burned all of his textbooks, got rid of his uniform—” Markus swallowed. “It’s like he tried to erase that part of himself.”
He hesitated, his voice quieter now. “That’s why… I’m here.” His fingers tightened on the wooden stock of the flintlock. “Because at least—I want to give back to him. To show him that he doesn’t have to throw himself into danger for my sake anymore. That someone else can protect him or anyone he cares and loves. For once.”
“You’re a brave one, Markus.” Catherine said, smiling. “You definitely have a mark of a knight.”
Catherine and Markus ventured further, guided by the lights of Catherine’s staff. The dense forest gradually thinned, revealing scattered fragments of stone.
At first, just a few half-buried columns, their faded white surfaces cracked and leaning, worn down by time. The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp earth.
As they ventured deeper, the ruins around them became more distinct. More columns lay toppled, some broken in half, others standing in defiance of centuries past. Then, beyond a ridge, the remnants of a vast structure emerged—a ruin far greater than the scattered fragments before. 
Its once mighty walls stood in defiance, their surfaces adorned with creeping vines and twisted roots. Whatever this place had been, nature had not only reclaimed it—it had consumed it, growing through the stone like a slow and patient conqueror.
Markus abruptly stopped, his grip tightening on the flintlock rifle. His gaze landed on a stone sign, half-buried in the dirt. The faint, scorched lettering was written in an unfamiliar, elegant script.
Catherine stepped closer, brushing some of the dirt away with her gloved hand. Her eyes traced the symbols carefully. “It’s Elvish,” she murmured. “‘Bastion of Craemonia.’”
Markus let out a slow breath. “Bastion, huh?” His voice was dry, uneasy. “Doesn’t feel very bastion-like to me.” He swept his gaze over the ruins, rifle raised slightly, as if the shadows themselves might lunge at them.
“What is this place, anyway?” Markus continued.
“Just like the sign said, It’s Craemonia…”Catherine answered, “The Bastion of Craemonia. This was an elven stronghold, built under the reign of Emperor Nocturnilus the Conqueror.”
“His empire reaches far at the time,” Catherine stepped forward, her staff tapping against the stones as she walked. “Weshaven might be a small island, but he probably had found some use for it. And he used this bastion as a research outpost… for Alchemy.”
“Alchemy?” Markus raised an eyebrow. “But I thought Elves had already known Magic at that time. Like y’know… Conjuration, Illusions… Alchemy.”
“Oh yes we did, we have everything Magic has to offer… All but Alchemy,” Catherine confirmed. “It remained a mystery for us, Alchemy came from the nomadic tribes of the eastern dunes. At the time, the Elves hadn’t discovered it yet. Emperor Nocturnilus was determined to unlock its secrets before the mortals and the dwarves.”
 “So…” Markus frowned. “What happened?”
“If you read your history books, you should know that Nocturnilus’s reign collapsed, the once solitary Elven community integrated with the mortals, they had forgotten and lost faith to their Emperor.” Catherine’s steps slowed. She looked up at the ruined bastion. “But the remnant of his conquest lay littered across the continents, like this one here. And whatever he discovered… it wasn’t Alchemy.”
A breeze stirred the overgrown foliage, whispering through the ruins like a voice lost in time. Markus exhaled sharply. “Then… What is it?”
But Catherine stayed silent…
The road ahead narrowed as they reached the outer walls—vast, towering things that still bore the remnants of intricate carvings. Beyond them, deeper in the ruins, loomed what remained of the Bastion’s inner sanctum.
“Yeah… I really don’t like this place, Miss Catherine.” Markus adjusted his rifle uneasily. “You’re sure this is where we need to be?”
 “This is the place.” Catherine nodded, her eyes fixed on the ruin. “The Codex may be still inside.” She paused, then added, “If it’s still here.” 
Markus groaned, lowering the rifle enough to look at her. “If it’s still here? Great. We came all this way for a maybe.” 

“Not just a maybe.” Catherine smirked faintly. “A once-in-a-lifetime, maybe. There’s a difference.”  

Markus shook his head, muttering under his breath as he adjusted his grip on the rifle. “Now I get it why Eddie don’t want to go.” 

-o-

The mossy pavement wound between crumbling archways and open courtyards, as Catherine and Markus made their way. 
Step by step, the ruins revealed themselves. Beyond the fallen columns and collapsed archways, a massive structure came into view. The grand edifice stood partially intact, its vast stone walls weathered but unyielding. To the right, another building loomed, connected by a ruined hallway. The skeletal remains of a shattered dome crowned the secondary structure, and within its collapsed roof, an enormous telescope lay broken and rusting, its once-polished frame now dulled by time.
Markus let out a low whistle. “That’s… not what I expected.”
Catherine stopped beside him, her gaze sweeping over the structures. “This is the Aeron Laboratory.” Her voice carried a quiet awe. “Named after Aeron, one of the Nine Sages of Enlightenment. But before he became a Sage, this was his laboratory.”
Markus eyed the ruins warily. “And what exactly was he researching?”
Catherine exhaled slowly. “Alchemy. Or at least… that was the intention.”
They crossed the threshold into the ruined laboratory. The temperature seemed to drop as they stepped inside. The roof had caved in long ago, and moonlight streamed through the gaps, illuminating rows of tarnished silver equipment. Alembics, retorts, and distillation coils still lined the cracked stone tables, their glass components shattered into jagged remnants on the floor. A thick layer of dust coated everything, disturbed only by the occasional shift of wind.
“This was a laboratory?” Markus muttered. “Doesn’t look like much now.”
Catherine stepped forward, brushing dust off a silver alembic, its once-polished surface dulled with age. “It was more than that,” she said. “Aeron was one of Nocturnilus’s chief researcher. This was his work.”
Markus shot her a look. “Nocturnilus’s? You mean the same Nocturnilus who tried to conquer half the world? I didn’t expect they had worked together.”
Catherine nodded. “Before he saw the truth of what he was serving.” She ran a hand over a series of faded engravings on the wall. “Aeron was a scholar, fascinated with the nature of Alchemy—back when the Elves knew nothing about it. Nocturnilus wanted him to uncover its secrets, to wield it as a tool of power. But… something changed.”
Markus frowned. “What do you mean, ‘changed’?”
“He left,” she said quietly. “Abandoned his work. Abandoned this place. He never spoke of what he found here.”
Markus exhaled, scanning the ruined lab once more. The broken equipment, the fractured ceiling, the eerie quiet. “So whatever he discovered…” He gestured around them. “It wasn’t Alchemy.”
Catherine didn’t answer.
The wind stirred through the open roof, rustling the overgrown foliage. Somewhere in the ruins, something shifted—stone settling, or perhaps something else.
Catherine tore her gaze away from the wall, stepping back from the runes. “Let’s find what we came for.”
The arching corridor led them forward, deeper into the ruined bastion. The white stone walls narrowed, then expanded into a vast, open chamber. As Catherine and Markus stepped through the threshold, their breath caught at the sight before them.
The Grand Hall of the Observatory stretched wide, its ceiling once a magnificent dome, now fractured and open to the night sky. Jagged remnants of the collapsed telescope loomed above, its broken frame catching the silver light of the moon. The glow filtered through the shattered structure, casting long, spectral beams onto the marble floor. Dust swirled in the air, dancing in the pale luminescence.
At the center of the hall, standing alone beneath the celestial glow, was the lectern.
It was ancient, carved from the same pale stone as the bastion itself. Intricate elven engravings ran along its sides, whispering of knowledge long forgotten. And resting atop it, bathed in the moon’s embrace, was a book—its leather cover faded, its gilded edges worn with time.
Catherine’s steps were slow, deliberate. Her fingers hovered over the tome before she lifted it with a reverence reserved for something sacred. The weight of history pressed against her palms.
She turned the first page, then another, eyes sweeping over the delicate, curling script within. The scent of aged parchment filled the air as she flipped through its contents, scanning, absorbing.
Then, at last, she stilled. A slow, satisfied exhale escaped her lips.
Catherine turned to Markus, her eyes gleaming with something between triumph and awe.
“This is it,” she whispered, her voice carrying through the grand hall like a proclamation. Her fingers traced the worn title inscribed within.
“Codex Chilandar.”
Catherine stood still, her fingers lingering on the worn pages of the Codex, her heart still steady from the thrill of discovery.
Then—something shifted.
A flicker. A whisper of movement.
The moonlight, so pristine only moments before, dimmed—just for an instant. As if something vast and unseen had passed before it.
Catherine’s breath caught. She turned sharply, eyes scanning the ruined chamber.
“What was that?” Markus whispered. His grip tightened around the flintlock rifle as his instincts flared. He raised the barrel, eyes darting to the shadows. Nothing moved. Nothing stirred. And yet—
A distant creak. A soft, falling pebble.
Then—
With a deafening roar, the ceiling above them shattered.
White stone and rusted metal rained down as the remnants of the collapsed dome gave way. A monstrous form plunged through the fractured sky, wings of shadow unfurling with a terrible force. Dust and debris surged outward in a choking storm.
Catherine staggered back, the impact tearing her from her thoughts. Her hands slipped—the Codex tumbled from her grasp, landing with a hollow thud before the lectern.
Markus fired. The shot rang out, the flash of gunpowder illuminating the chaos for an instant—then fading uselessly against the dark, scaled hide of the beast.
The creature stood before them now, massive and inescapable. Dark wings unfurled, their jagged edges slicing through the settling dust. A maw lined with glistening fangs parted, exhaling a deep, shuddering breath that smelled of ash and decay.
And between its taloned feet, the Codex lay, untouched.
“Markus, go.” Her voice was firm, urgent.
He didn’t lower the rifle. “I’m not leaving you.”
Catherine’s eyes flicked between him and the dragon.
“Markus,” she snapped. “I can handle this. But not with you in the way.”
He clenched his jaw. “I can help—”
“You’ll die!”
The words cut through the air sharper than any blade.
Markus stiffened.
Catherine’s expression softened, just slightly. “Go back to the Traveller’s Path, get to Eddie and Torrie.” Her voice lowered, urgent but not unkind. “I need you out of here. Now.”
Markus hesitated. “Catherine—”
“I have lived longer than you and your entire lineage combined.” She took a step forward, her staff firm in her grip. “I know what I’m doing.”
The dragon inhaled sharply.
Markus cursed under his breath. His fingers twitched against the rifle. He stole one last glance at her. Then—
He turned and ran.
The Grand Hall trembled behind him as the beast let out a bone-rattling snarl. The last thing he saw before vanishing through the broken archway was Catherine, standing firm, facing the creature alone.

            <Title>Chapter 25 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Catherine trudged through the shattered remnants of the Illusory Forest, the path barely recognizable beneath the rubble. The trees loomed around them, casting long, jagged shadows over the uneven ground.
Catherine walked beside him, clutching the splintered remains of her once-proud brass mahogany staff. Its delicate engravings, once gleaming with alchemical precision, were now marred by cracks and soot, hastily mended by Alchemical Mending.
Eddie’s rifle—his father’s rifle—lay in two broken halves, its finely crafted compartments torn apart. Each step forward pressed the weight of the battle deeper into his chest.
Catherine’s alchemy-infused salves having eased some of his pain, but unable to mend the deep bruises and the sharp, unnatural angle of his arm. He barely winced but held it close, as if acknowledging the injury would make it worse.
His own body ached—bruises, burns, exhaustion pressing in like a vice. His steps were uneven, breaths shallow, but he refused to slow down. Not yet.
The night stretched on, the forest shifting around them. Quiet. Too quiet.
Catherine finally spoke, her voice hesitant, breaking the fragile silence.
“Say, Edward,” She began, “Have you heard about the History of Nocturnilus the Conqueror?”
“The Elven Emperor?” Eddie asked back,
Catherine nodded, then continued, &quot;There have been sorcerers who toppled kingdoms, enslaved millions, and committed atrocities beyond imagination.&quot;
She let that sink in before continuing.
&quot;Once, he was just a spellcraftsman millenias ago—a sorcerer in service to the Northern Elven Kingdom. The elves have always lived by magic. For us, it was a gift, a birthright, a force of creation.&quot;
Her voice darkened.
&quot;But for Nocturnilus, it was never enough.&quot;
She glanced at the treetops, as if searching for memories carved into the night sky.
&quot;Blinded by greed, by the hunger for more, he turned his power toward conquest. He was the first sorcerer to raise a city of stone with a mere gesture—and the first to reduce one to ash just as easily. He marched across the lands, toppling kings, razing kingdoms, and forging an empire from the ruins of others.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the earlier pain still pressing against his chest.
&quot;His armies enslaved millions, binding them with chains wrought from his own magic. He thought himself invincible.&quot;
Catherine’s voice dropped lower, almost a whisper. &quot;But the more he took, the more magic consumed him. It changed him. His flesh, his mind… his very soul. By the end, he was no longer a man. Some say he was no longer even an elf. Just a shadow, a being twisted by his own power.&quot;
&quot;And there was Aeron the Founder… One of the nine sages.&quot;
The name lingered between them like a spark in the cold night air.
&quot;He was an elf, like Nocturnilus. In fact, he once served under him—stood at his side as a fellow conjurer, weaving spells to expand Nocturnilus’s empire. For years, he followed orders, watching cities crumble, watching people enslaved by the very magic that was meant to enrich elven lives.&quot;
Catherine’s voice grew firm. &quot;But then, something changed. Aeron looked at the ruins they had left behind, at the lives shattered by conquest, and he could no longer bear it. He chose to walk away.&quot;
Eddie frowned. &quot;He just… left?&quot;
&quot;Not just left,&quot; Catherine corrected. &quot;He rebelled. He turned against the empire he had once helped build. He traveled to the very lands he had once helped destroy—not as a conqueror, but as a healer. A teacher.”
“He taught magic to those who feared it, gave power to those who had none. And in the end, it was his students, his disciples, the very people Nocturnilus had enslaved, who brought the tyrant down to his knees.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the weight of her words settling in his chest.
&quot;Aeron could have followed the same path,&quot; Catherine continued, &quot;But he chose differently. He eventually founded and became one of the Nine Sages, the very founders of the magical world as we know it.”
“He and the others built cities where there was only wasteland, cured diseases that once ravaged nations, opened doors to possibilities no one had dared to dream of before.&quot;
Eddie’s fingers twitched at his sides. His thoughts churned, Catherine’s words fighting against years of self-doubt.
Catherine didn’t hesitate. She placed a hand on his shoulder, firm and reassuring.
&quot;It’s not about what magic can do,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s about what you can to do with it.&quot;
The weight of her words settled in his chest, pressing against the scars he had buried deep.
For a moment, neither of them spoke. The night stretched quiet and still around them
His thoughts swirled, heavy as the night pressing in around them. The conversation lingered in his mind, every word, every confession.
But it wasn’t just his own past haunting him now. It was the stories Catherine had told him—the truth behind history.
Nocturnilus, the Elven Emperor who razed nations in conquest.Aeron Consurion, the Founding Sage who shaped the Magical World anew.
Both had walked this very path.Both had wielded the same magic.
One was a tyrant.One was a pioneer.
The history books painted them in stark contrast—opposites in morality, in purpose. Two figures who should never have shared the same road.
And yet… they had.
So what did that make him?
His vision blurred. His body felt heavier. His grip tightened around the rifle, but his limbs trembled beneath him.
He walked. And walked. And walked.
The trees thinned, shadows giving way to the open road. And through the haze of exhaustion, he saw them.
Markus stood ahead, arms crossed, his sharp eyes scanning the darkness, pacing slightly.Torrie, wrapped in her yellow knit sweater, bounced anxiously on her heels, her twin tails swaying as she strained to see down the path.
His best friend.His sister.
They were waiting for him.
Eddie took a step toward them—
His body gave out.
The world lurched sideways, the earth rushing up to meet him.
Darkness swallowed him whole.</Text>

            <Text>The path twisted and narrowed. The forest thinned, giving way to crumbling stone walls and scattered debris. The air here was heavier, carrying the faint scent of ash and decay. Moonlight spilt over the ruined town. It illuminates the jagged remnants of stone buildings. Their once-proud facades were now draped in thick vines and cloaked with moss. Trees had long since claimed the poor town as their own, their roots snaking through cobblestone streets and bursting through walls as if nature had conspired to erase the city from history. 

Markus abruptly stopped, his grip tightening on the flintlock rifle. His gaze landed on a charred wooden sign half-buried in the dirt. The faint, scorched lettering read: Welcome to Groville. 

“Welcome, huh?” Markus muttered uneasily, his voice barely above a whisper. “Doesn’t feel very welcoming to me.” He scanned the empty streets, rifle raised slightly as if the shadows themselves might lunge at them. 

Catherine stepped ahead, her staff brushing against the stones as she moved. She didn’t seem as unnerved, but her eyes lingered on the sign. “Groville,” she said softly, almost reverently. “It’s hard to believe people lived here once.” 

Markus’s voice was tense. “Yeah, well, they’re not living here now, are they? I don’t like this place, Catherine. It’s... too quiet.” 

The eerie silence hung around them. Broken only by the occasional creak of a distant tree branch. The wind stirred, rustling the overgrown foliage that consumed the ruins. As they walked deeper into the town, Markus flinched at every noise, his rifle sweeping toward a sound that turned out to be nothing more than a rat skittering across the stones or a bird startled from its perch. 

The road narrowed into what might have once been a central square. It is now dominated by the looming remains of a cathedral. Though cracked and leaning, its towering spire still pierced the night sky, defiant against centuries of decay. The grand stone arches of the cathedral’s facade were blanketed in moss, while a massive oak tree had burst through the centre of the structure, its gnarled branches reaching outward like skeletal arms. 

Markus stopped at the threshold, the rifle raised again. “You’re sure this is where we need to be?” he asked, his voice edged with scepticism and discomfort. 

Catherine nodded, her eyes fixed on the ruin. “This is the place. The Artefact should be inside.” She paused, then added, “If it’s still here.” 

Markus groaned, lowering the rifle enough to look at her. “If it’s still here? Great. We came all this way for a maybe.” 

Catherine smirked faintly. “Not just a maybe. A once-in-a-lifetime, maybe. There’s a difference.” 

Markus shook his head, muttering under his breath as he adjusted his grip on the rifle. “This place gives me the creeps. Let’s grab what you need and get out of here.” 


As they stepped inside the cathedral, the temperature seemed to drop. Their footsteps echoed on the cracked stone floor, and the vast emptiness swallowed the sound. Stained glass windows, long shattered, cast fragmented patterns of moonlight onto the ground. Vines and roots wove through the walls, blending the sacred and the wild. 

The lectern stood on a pedestal at the heart of the cathedral. Bathed in silvery moonlight streaming through the shattered roof. Twisting roots coiled around the base as if the great oak tree was trying to claim it as its own. Resting atop the lectern was the Artefact—an ancient, ornate relic, its surface etched with runes that seemed to pulse faintly with an otherworldly glow. 

Catherine’s breath hitched as she stepped closer, her eyes fixed on the Artefact. “There it is,” she whispered, her voice reverent. “One of the Nine Sages must have used this. It’s incredible…” 

Markus, standing a few paces behind her, shifted uncomfortably. His grip on the flintlock rifle was so tight that his knuckles had turned white. The oppressive silence of the cathedral pressed down on him, broken only by the faint rustle of leaves in the wind. He scanned the dark corners of the ruins, his unease growing by the second. 

“I don’t know about this, ma’am,” Markus muttered, his voice strained. “It’s getting late, and the forest feels... different. Like it’s watching us.” 

Catherine didn’t look back; she focused entirely on the Artefact. “We’re almost there. Just a bit further,” she said, brushing off his concerns with her hand. 

Markus took a shaky step forward, his boots crunching against the debris of the stained glass on the ground. The tension in the air seemed to thicken with each passing moment. The rifle wavered slightly in his hands as sweat beaded on his forehead. He could feel his pulse pounding in his ears. 

“Catherine, I—” Markus began, his voice faltering. 

He froze mid-sentence. A low, rumbling growl echoed through the cavernous cathedral. Reverberating between the broken walls and twisted roots. The sound was deep, guttural, and far too close. Markus’s breath caught as he turned his head toward the source. 

His eyes widened in terror. Something massive shifted from the shadows near the back of the cathedral. A pair of glowing eyes pierced the darkness, their unnatural light casting faint reflections on the stone floor. 

“Ma’am?” Markus said, barely above a whisper, “Something’s here.” 

Catherine, still fixated on the Artefact, took another step forward. “Just a bit closer,” she murmured as if in a trance. “We need to—” 

“Look out!” Markus’s voice broke into a panicked shout. 

The creature emerged from the shadows with a feral roar. The faint light of the moon illuminated its massive frame, and the ground seemed to tremble beneath its weight. 

Markus raised the flintlock rifle. His hands shook as he aimed at the beast. His breath is ragged. His heart was racing as he squeezed the trigger. 

A thunderous crack shattered the tension. The muzzle flash lit up the cathedral for the briefest moment. Illuminating Catherine’s stunned face and the creature’s feral snarl.

            <Title>Chapter 4E</Title>
            <Text>The campus at midnight was a place transformed. The chatter of daytime was gone, replaced by a stillness that carried weight. Only the hush of wind slipping between the old stone halls, the rhythm of footfalls on cobbled paths, and the occasional chirr of crickets dared to interrupt the silence. Every now and then, distant laughter or the murmur of conversation drifted from windows still lit—last-minute crammers, night owls, or lovers defying curfew.
Eddie walked with his hands in his coat pockets, his steps steady now, no longer leaning on a crutch. His leg still ached if he pushed it, but he’d healed enough to walk without help. The cool night air bit through his collar, but he didn’t mind it. It kept him sharp.
Will strolled beside him, guitar slung casually over one shoulder. He must’ve come straight from a late-night practice in the Bardry building—his fingers were inked with fresh rune smudges and the faint scent of burnt sage clung to him.
“Hey, c’mon Ed!” Will said, nudging Eddie with his elbow. “You haven’t told us how’d the date go!”
“I told you, Will.” Eddie gave him a look. “It wasn’t a date.”
Will raised both brows like that proved his point. “Oh yeah? A stroll through the sanctuary, just the two of you, lingering stares across carnivorous beasts—classic not-a-date behavior.”
“Look- mate.” Eddie sighed, rubbing his eyes, “Madeleine called me for a reason, alright? She’s just called me because she needed to make sure of something.”
A third voice joined in from the other side.
“Uh-huh, is it making sure you’re compatible,” Ashley said sweetly, falling into step with them. She was fresh from the Witchcraft building, her long sleeves pushed up to the elbows and a faint shimmer of spelllight still clinging to her hair.
Eddie groaned. “Not you too.”
Ashley grinned. “What? I’m just saying. Mutual trust is important in a relationship. And you cannot get that if you haven’t had a stroll with just the two of you.”
“I will turn both of you into bronze statues, if you both don’t shut up.” Eddie hissed.
They continued down the stone path toward the library, the laughter slowly ebbing as the towering structure came into view, casting long shadows under the moonlight.
“So,” Ashley said, turning slightly toward Eddie. “All jokes aside… what did you and Madeleine find last week? You didn’t go all the way to Norwood just to have a date, did you?”
Eddie hesitated for a second, eyes flicking toward the library doors ahead. Then he sighed, the words coming slowly.
“Firstly,” Eddie said, now a bit annoyed, “It wasn’t a date, but the next thing I found was South Alamirian Tiger,” he said. “That’s the base creature that attacked me a few weeks ago. Big cat from the dunes. Real one—not whatever came after me. But the way it moved, the eyes… it was the same. Just—” he stopped, searching for the right phrasing.
 “The thing that attacked me wasn’t just a tiger. It was… stitched with something else. We still don’t know what. But we know what it is a Chimaera.”
Ashley slowed her steps. “That can’t be right. Chimaera breeding been outlawed for centuries. No reputable alchemist would even touch that kind of spellwork.”
“No good one would I bet,” Will muttered. “But someone out there’s doing it. And the authorities are letting their bad experiment results roam around campus.”
“No. They’re not letting anything. From what I’ve heard, the police are hunting them—quietly. Curfew patrols have doubled. It’s not public knowledge because…” She paused, then said it plainly. “They don’t want people thinking Edenfield isn’t safe.”
Eddie ran a hand through his hair, the anxiety returning to his jaw.
“Madeleine said she knows someone who might be able to help. Someone with ties to the local press. She’s going to reach out when she can.”
Will tilted his head. “Who is it?”
Eddie shrugged. “I don’t know yet. She didn’t say.”
Ashley gave him a sideways glance. “And you trust her?”
He nodded. “Yeah.”
They reached the base of the library steps. The doors loomed above them, tall and still. For a moment, none of them moved—just stood in the cold, listening to the silence wrap back around them.
Then Will broke it with a grin. “Well. Nothing like illegal magical bioengineering conspiracies to spice up your semester.”
Ashley gave him a flat look. “This is serious, Will.”
“I am being serious. I’m terrified. This is how I cope.”
As they reached the great oak doors of the Edenfield Library, Eddie slowed his pace. A small wooden sign hung crookedly on the handle: CLOSED. The curtains on the tall arched windows were drawn, veiling the warm glow within.
But Ashley stepped forward confidently, peering through a narrow gap in the curtains. “There,” she said, pointing. “Blue cover on the sill. We’re expected.”
They pushed the door open, hinges creaking softly. The familiar scent of parchment and old dust welcomed them—but what stood inside was anything but familiar comfort.
At the long central table, beneath the golden light of an enchanted chandelier, stood Victoria Aynesworth, arms folded, chin high, lips curled in a perfect mixture of amusement and disdain. She was flanked by two of her Student Council companions—both equally smug in their tailored sashes and gleaming house pins.
Will stopped in his tracks. “You’ve got to be kidding.”
Ashley’s expression darkened. “What is she doing here?”
Eddie’s jaw tightened. His last run-in with Victoria had nearly cost him his place at Edenfield. The memory of her sneering accusations, her carefully worded report full of half-truths and venom, surfaced like bile.
Victoria’s eyes sparkled as she took them in, one by one. “Well, well, well,” she drawled. “If it isn’t the Pirate, the Bard, and the filthy Witch.”
Will bristled immediately. “Takes one to know one, Aysnesworth. Or are you trying on slurs now, see which one fits?”
Victoria gave him a mock pout. “Aw, still got that charming sense of humor. No wonder they stuck you in Bardry—you clearly can’t handle anything more than that.”
Ashley stepped forward, her voice cool. “Claire invited us. Not you.”
“Oh,” Victoria said with a syrupy smile, “But I was invited, darling. Just like you. We all want to solve this little problem, don’t we?”
Eddie glanced around warily. “Where’s Claire? And where’s Madeleine?”
“They’ll be along shortly,” Victoria said, casually taking a seat. “But don’t worry. We’re all friends here.”
“Friends?” Eddie shot back, arms crossed. “You tried to get us expelled!”
Victoria’s smirk didn’t falter. “And you’re stealing books.”
Will stepped in with a dry scoff. “You mean liberating neglected knowledge from an overregulated system?”
“Call it whatever you like,” Victoria said, eyes gleaming. “You lot act like the rules don’t apply to you. Just because you’ve got a sob story and a few tricks up your sleeves doesn’t mean you belong here.”
Ashley’s voice turned cold. “You’ve got some nerve talking about who belongs here, when all you’ve done is try to tear people down from day one.”
Victoria’s eyes narrowed. “Tread carefully, Witch.”
“Or what?” Eddie stepped forward. “You’ll write another incident report?”
Before Victoria could reply, a door creaked open behind the reception desk. Madeleine and Claire emerged—Madeleine looking mildly exasperated, and Claire holding a stack of leather-bound tomes in one hand and a steaming teacup in the other.
“Honestly,” Claire snapped, her voice echoing across the shelves. “Would the lot of you please stop bickering like a bunch of toddlers?! I can hear you from the back stacks.”
Everyone turned to her, stunned into silence.
Claire stepped forward, setting the books down with a firm thump. “This is my library. Which means if anyone gets caught tonight, I lose my volunteer license. Not you. So unless you want to take over my hours organizing the Archives every Thursday morning—quiet down.”
With a few reluctant mutters, the group settled—Victoria back in her seat, Will leaning against a column, and Ashley crossing her arms but staying silent. Eddie took a seat on the long table, directly opposite from Victoria, still tense but holding back.
“Good. Now that the theatre’s over… can you please explain what’s going on?” Claire said, motioning towards Madeleine
Madeleine folded her hands on the table. “After the incident in the East Courtyard,” she began, her voice steady, “We’ve come to the conclusion that the one roaming at the streets at night are Chimaera.” 
A ripple of unease passed through the room.
That immediately drew a scoff from Victoria. She leaned back, arms crossed. “And you’re basing that on his word?” she said, tilting her chin toward Eddie. “How do you know he’s not making it up?”
Eddie leaned forward, fists clenched. “Oh, I—”
But Ashley cut him off, voice calm but pointed. “Because there’ve already been multiple reports,” she said, locking eyes with Victoria. “People claiming they were attacked by drunks or wild animals, only for it to be brushed off by the Guard. No follow-up, no investigation. Sound familiar?”
Victoria didn’t answer, but her expression hardened.
Ashley continued, “Maybe those people weren’t drunk. Maybe they did see something—something they weren’t supposed to. But they were told into thinking it was all in their heads.”
The tension was thick enough to slice with a wand. But before it could spark again, Madeleine held up her hand.
“Come on, everyone,” she said, voice firm. “I didn’t bring you all here to fight. I brought you here because whether you like it or not, we’re all connected in this.”
She turned to Victoria, her voice softening. “You’ve been upset for months, haven’t you? Since your dog went missing.”
Victoria stiffened. “What does that have to do with this?”
“Where did it happen?” Madeleine pressed gently.
Victoria hesitated. “Hallowmore District.”
Will let out a low whistle. “Figures.”
“That’s where it starts to get strange,” Madeleine said, pacing slowly. “Because the moment I checked that area, I found similar reports. Missing pets. Scratches on doors. Odd tracks in the alleys. The same place where Eddie was attacked.”
Eddie leaned forward, resting his arms on the table. “Alright, Madeleine, but what are you planning to do with all of this?”
“You know this better than I do, Edward.” Madeleine stopped pacing and looked at him. “Chimaeras don’t breed,” she said. “They’re not like natural animals. They’re created—stitched together, piece by piece, using advanced Alchemy and dark magic. So if they exist… someone’s making them. Somewhere.”
Victoria gave a small nod, arms crossed but listening now.
“I asked Victoria to reach out to the Edenfield Press,” Madeleine continued. “To check recent articles—anything reporting strange sightings, disappearances, oddities. Most of them are ridiculous, obviously—ghost stories, people seeing shadow-dogs, that sort of thing—but when you look at them together…”
“They make a pattern,” Eddie finished.
Madeleine nodded. “Exactly.”
Victoria turned to her friends. “You two—get the map.”
The two student council members moved quickly, retrieving a large folded map from one of the reading desks. They cleared space at the table and laid it flat across the wood, the parchment crackling under their fingers.
Victoria stepped around the side and gestured to the colored ink markings scattered across the paper. “We cross-referenced the articles with the city’s event archives. Most were nonsense, but a few of the stories showed consistency—sightings of unnatural movement, guttural noises, pet disappearances, signs of struggle.”
Eddie peered at the map. Red ink dotted various corners of the city, with colored pins anchoring clusters.
“They’re everywhere,” Ashley murmured. “Scattered.”
“They are,” Victoria said. “But look here.”
She gestured toward the map’s lower-right quadrant. The Hallowmore District. Compared to the rest of Edenfield, the dots here were dense, overlapping in places, with lines drawn connecting several known alleyways, derelict buildings, and abandoned properties.
“We think this is the epicenter,” Victoria said. “And if it is… then whatever’s making these things might be there.”
The group leaned in, scanning the spread of dots and notes. Will squinted, tracing the pattern with his finger before tapping a spot just off the main thoroughfare.
“Hold up,” he said, tapping the map with the back of his pencil. “What’s this place? ‘Animal Garden?’”
Ashley leaned in. “A pet store. I think it’s one of the only ones in Hallowmore.”
Will sat back, his brow furrowed. “That doesn’t track. In working-class neighborhoods like this, pet stores are rare—barely any business in them. Most folks can’t afford fancy pets, let alone vet bills or the upkeep. You might get feed shops, sure. But a whole storefront for companion animals in the middle of factories and forges? That’s weird.”
Madeleine then asked, “What do you mean by that?”
“I mean,” Will continued, “Hallowmore’s not like Northgarden or the Arcane Quarter with all the posh conjuration schools and creature studies programs. This area’s about heat, labor, stone. And this pet shop is boxed in by factories, and not even the new kind—abandoned ones. It smells fishy to me.” 

Will then leaned back, “If I were building Frankenstein looking crap, I’d want a place like that—looks innocent, nobody asks questions, and the deliveries wouldn’t look suspicious.” 
Eddie raised a brow. “That’s… disturbingly logical.”
Will shrugged. “Grew up around strip malls. Sketchy pet shops, dollar stores, carwashes all crammed next to each other. You learn to spot the weird ones fast.”
Ashley leaned over the map. “So if Animal Garden is part of it… that might be where the Chimaeras are coming from… right?”
“Or at least where they’re getting their raw materials,” Will added grimly.
Madeleine nodded slowly, her expression darkening. “There is one way to find out.”</Text>
            <Notes>Eddie propose to trust Walther Instead

Victoria Aynesworth was needed for the record of sightings of the Chimaeras, or records of sightings and where the police dispatches the Chimaera

They will then go to the locations, and Madeleine will trace the footsteps and find the footsteps trace

They then found out that all the sightings reports and the place where they dispatches it, kinda of leads to one location

That is a petstore at Hollowmere District 

Animal Garden

Note that the Book Pirate’s Headquarters are in Hallowmore, and the Curfiew happens outside campus

            <Title>Chapter 4</Title>
            <Text>By the time they reached the heart of Dover, the quiet of the cliffs had given way to the morning bustle. Cars honked as they squeezed past each other on narrow streets, students in varying shades of uniform filled the pavements, and the scent of bakery bread wafted from a shop nearby. The town, true to form, was alive with motion.
Preston Secondary stood nestled between a row of old stone terraces and a small park, its wrought-iron gates painted deep blue, the school crest gleaming in gold above them. The building loomed tall—its Victorian bricks weathered by decades of sea air and teenage drama. Even now, Eddie could spot a cluster of students huddled near the entrance, laughing loudly, dodging around teachers with clipboards.
He slowed the bike to a stop just outside the gate.
“Well,” he said, turning slightly in the saddle. “Here we are. First day of the rest of your life.”
Torrie swung off the bike, adjusting her satchel and brushing imaginary dust off her sweater. She looked smaller all of a sudden—still stubborn, still trying not to show nerves, but Eddie recognized that look in her eyes. He’d worn it once too.
He glanced up at the school, expression softening. “You know,” he said, “I used to hate this place.”
Torrie blinked. “Really?”
“Mm-hmm.” He looked at the gates as if they might remember him. “It was rough sometimes. I didn’t really fit in. But,” he paused, “I still learned a lot here.”
Torrie didn’t say anything, just looked at him.
He smiled, a little wistful. “It wasn’t all bad of course, there are some fond memories.”
She looked down at her shoes. “I’m not gonna have a rough time like you, right?”
Eddie’s smile widened as he knelt a little to meet her eye level. “You’re gonna do great. You’re way braver than I ever was. And smarter.”
“Flattery,” she mumbled, grinning.
“I’m being honest here.” He tapped her satchel. “You’ve got this. And if it ever gets too weird, too loud, or too hard—you tell someone. Don’t go it alone.”
Torrie nodded, then, unexpectedly, flung her arms around him. Eddie blinked, caught off guard, but returned the hug with a tight squeeze.
“Bestest of luck, little genius,” he murmured.
Then, with one last glance, Torrie turned and walked through the school gates, disappearing into the tide of students.
Eddie stayed a moment longer, watching, the sun climbing higher over the rooftops. Preston hadn’t changed much—but he had. He turned his bike slowly, the wind brushing against his face, and pedaled back into the streets of Dover, not quite smiling, but not sad either.

-o-

By the time Eddie reached the city centre, Dover was fully awake. The streets buzzed with lunchtime chatter, cafés spilling over with office workers on break, and the sound of delivery vans rumbling over cobbled lanes. Sunlight bounced off shop windows and double-decker buses, the town’s usual midday energy pulsing all around him.
Eddie weaved through the foot traffic and made his way to the Dover Public Library—a modest sandstone building tucked between a pharmacy and a charity shop. It stood with quiet dignity, the carved letters over the door slightly faded, as if the building itself had seen generations come and go without needing to announce itself loudly.
He hopped off his bike and wheeled it toward the rack near the front entrance. As he secured the lock, he looked up at the old windows, familiar now, almost comforting. This place had become a second home.
The bell above the door gave a soft chime as he stepped inside. Cool air greeted him, along with the scent of aging paper and furniture polish. Rows of tall shelves stretched across the space, silent but inviting. Near the front desk, the librarian glanced up from her stamp pad and lit up immediately.
“Well if it isn’t Mr. Welton, right on schedule,” she said with a warm smile. “Thought we’d lost you to the school run.”
“Had to make sure my sister didn’t combust on her first day,” Eddie replied, returning the smile.
“She’ll do fine. You always did,” she said knowingly, then tapped the side of her temple. “Sharp up here, just like you.”
He offered a polite nod, not quite agreeing, and made his way to his usual corner—tucked between the local history section and the windows that overlooked the back garden. The outlet still worked. The chair still squeaked. The familiar hum of printers and soft murmuring voices filled the space like white noise.
Eddie unpacked his laptop, coiled the charger neatly, and plugged in. It booted slowly, fan wheezing in protest, but it got there. As the screen blinked to life, he opened the folder labelled “Scholarships + Hope”, fingers already moving by muscle memory.
He had until summer.
That thought came back every morning like a ticking clock. He’d graduated sixth form, scraped good enough grades, and kept his head down. But none of that changed the fact that his family couldn't afford university—not really. Not without help.
He understood where his dad was coming from. An apprenticeship meant stability. Income. A path already walked. But Eddie knew himself—how his thoughts ran too fast or got stuck in loops. How he sometimes saw things, felt things, that made working with his hands in a workshop feel like a recipe for disaster.
He needed structure, yes—but of a different kind. Chemistry labs, lecture halls, libraries. He needed to chase something that made sense in his head, even when nothing else did.
He refreshed his inbox, barely hoping for anything different.
Ping.
The latest subject line made his stomach sink:&quot;We regret to inform you...&quot;
Again.
Eddie clicked through the emails in order, like ripping off plasters. One after another, the words blurred together:&quot;Unfortunately...&quot;&quot;We had many strong candidates...&quot;&quot;We appreciate your interest...&quot;
Even the rejections sounded tired now. Polite, cold, impersonal. He scrolled further—some universities hadn’t even bothered to respond at all. Silence felt worse than the ‘no.’
He sighed and pulled his backpack closer, fishing out a small spiral notebook, its cover soft and creased from overuse. He flipped it open to a page near the back—lined in messy ink and highlighter, the top scrawled:“Universities + Scholarships”
There were columns. First the UK: Bristol, Leeds, Warwick, King’s, Durham. All crossed out with a single, heavy line. Then others: TU Delft, ETH Zurich, Humboldt. And across the Atlantic—MIT, Berkeley, NYU—names that had once seemed like distant stars. All crossed out. Hope struck through in black ink.
Only a handful of names remained. Eddie stared at the last few, the final ones he’d clung to. He slowly, deliberately, drew a line through four of them.
Swish, swish, swish, swish.
Gone.
A quiet pressure built behind his eyes, but he blinked it away. What was the point of crying in a library?
He sat back, the notebook still open in front of him, and ran a hand through his hair. The list was nearly bare now. All that work. All that effort. And it still hadn’t been enough.
He tapped his pen absently against the side of the notebook, staring at the crossed-out names.
For a moment, the silence of the library pressed in around him. Heavy. Final.
Eddie slumped back in his chair, his gaze fixed on the peeling white ceiling above him. His thoughts were foggy, weighed down by the long hours of endless rejection.
Is this it?
He let the question hang in the air, unspoken, as though saying it out loud would make it real. Would he really be stuck here, working at the same greasy workshop as his father, crafting ship parts day in and day out? Was that all he was meant for? Just another cog in a machine that never stopped turning?
The weight of it settled in his chest. But then, after a moment of just staring blankly ahead, something nagged at him—a quiet voice in his mind telling him to at least look at his list one more time.
With a groan, Eddie turned his attention back to the notebook, scanning through the remaining options. His eyes flicked across the names of universities that had once seemed like tangible goals, but none were left unchecked. There was nothing but disappointment staring back at him.
But then, tucked between the pages, something caught his eye.
A name. One that had eluded his attention up until now.
Edenfield University.
He froze, staring at it. He couldn't remember when he'd written it down. It wasn’t like the others, all carefully researched. This one felt… out of place, like a forgotten dream. But more than that—it was odd because he was certain Edenfield didn’t even exist. Wasn’t it just some fairy tale?
His fingers hovered over the pen, ready to mark it off with the same decisive stroke as all the others. No—he was done. There was no point in dreaming anymore.
But then... something tugged at him. A quiet voice, almost pleading.
Come on, Eddie. Is this really how you want to end it?
His breath hitched for a moment, a strange flutter of desperation in his chest. The last remaining thread of hope was right there. A name he didn’t even remember writing down. A university that didn’t exist... or so he thought.
With a long exhale, he muttered to himself, “Oh, what the hell. Fine.”
It didn’t make sense. The place didn’t even show up in any real search results, did it? But right now, what was the harm?
His fingers moved against his will, bringing the cursor to the search bar. A sigh escaped him as he typed it out: Edenfield University.
The words appeared on the screen. The blinking cursor seemed to mock him for a moment, and Eddie waited for the inevitable: a result that didn’t exist, or maybe a glitch in the search engine. But he pressed &quot;Enter&quot; anyway.
The page began to load. Eddie sat back, bracing himself for disappointment—but somehow, the screen didn’t fill with error messages.
Instead, there it was. A website.
His breath caught in his throat as the page finally popped up.
He could’ve sworn he had searched for this place before—last month, in fact, when his mum mentioned it offhand after hearing the name from someone at the market. He remembered typing Edenfield University into the search bar and getting nothing but dead ends and unrelated results. He even brought it up with Mr. Harper, his old chemistry teacher. The man had laughed and said it sounded like a made-up school from a fantasy novel. None of the other teachers knew it either. None of his mates. Hell, even the British Council website had no listing.
So why was it here now?
The page that loaded looked ancient—like it had survived untouched since the early 2000s. The interface was blocky and awkward, all serif fonts and pale blue hyperlinks. The kind of website you’d expect to find archived on the Wayback Machine, not still active.
At the top of the homepage, in slightly pixelated gold lettering, was an emblem: a laurel wreath encircling a six-pointed star, beneath which read the words:
Edenfield University for Applied Magical Knowledge
Eddie blinked.
Magical?
He scrolled cautiously, the site revealed student photos—except they weren’t normal photos. They looked like old polaroids captured mid-motion. Students in robes of every color imaginable, some embroidered with alchemical symbols, others more plain. One girl wore what could only be described as a witch hat. Another donned a 17th-century scholar’s beret and cloak. And in the background—was that… a centaur?
Eddie leaned in, squinting. No, seriously, that was a centaur. Just casually walking through a courtyard paved with cobblestone and moss.
There were elves too. Even a man with goat legs laughing with a group of students beneath an autumn tree.
Eddie let out a dry scoff, sitting back. “What the hell is this?” he muttered. Some kind of outdated roleplay forum? Maybe a weird LARPing university fan page from two decades ago?
But then he scrolled down again.
One of the posts, strangely enough, had a recent timestamp: Posted May 2025.
It was clean. Modern, even. The only thing on the page that didn’t look like it belonged to a dead site.
The post title read:“Scholarship Opportunity for Foreign Applicants – 2025 Intake”
Eddie froze.
His cursor hovered over the link. It shouldn’t be here. None of this should exist. But the post looked legitimate—or at least, as legitimate as something on this bizarre website could look.
This is insane, he thought. Absolutely mental.
But still, his hand moved.
He clicked the link.</Text>

            <Text>The room was quieter than ever—thick with something unspoken. The lavender and chamomile had gone lukewarm.
Mrs. Welton returned to her seat across from Eddie, folding her hands on the table as if bracing herself.
“Before I say anything else,” she said carefully, “I need to ask you something first.”
Eddie looked up.
“What do you understand… about your parents? About where you come from?”
Eddie frowned, not understanding the question. “You and Dad… You’ve always been my parents.”
Mrs. Welton nodded slowly, then tilted her head just slightly. “I mean your real parents, Eddie. Your biological ones.”
The color in Eddie’s face shifted, the edges of his composure fraying. He pulled his mug a little closer, though he didn’t sip from it.
“I mean, I know what you told me. That they… died. In a plane crash. When I was at Aunt Catherine’s.”
His voice was flat. Distant. “You and Dad took me in after that.”
Mrs. Welton’s expression softened, touched with a kind of tired sorrow. “Yes. That’s the story we told you.”
Eddie looked up.
“We wanted to protect you. To let you grow up normal. To let you be a boy with school friends, family dinners, and birthday parties at Maxim’s.”
She looked at him with deep, unwavering eyes.
“But that story… Eddie, it was a lie. All of it.”
The words landed like a quiet blow.
Eddie blinked. “What?”
“A story,” she repeated, voice gentle but firm, “that I told you so you could integrate into this world—this version of the world—without fear, or questions. So you could live here without looking over your shoulder. Without remembering who you truly were.”
Eddie’s mouth parted slightly. “Why would you lie about something like that?”
Mrs. Welton exhaled through her nose, not looking away.
“Because, Eddie… where you truly come from is not here.”
The silence stretched, the old clock ticking steadily behind them.
Mrs. Welton didn’t look at Eddie at first. Her eyes were somewhere else—far away, deep in memory.
“I studied Illusions,” she finally said, softly. “At Edenfield.”
Eddie blinked. He wanted to say something—ask what she meant—but something in her voice made him stay quiet.
“It wasn’t a subject like the others. Not performance or trickery, as people might think. Illusions at Edenfield was about perception. About truth, and how easily it bends under light.”
She smiled faintly, lost in the past.
“Edenfield was… it was more than a school. It was a sanctuary for knowledge that doesn’t belong in textbooks. Knowledge the rest of the world isn’t ready to see. You didn’t just learn spells. You learned truths—about the world, about yourself.”
Eddie was still, hands wrapped tightly around his mug.
“I studied under a woman named Catherine,” Mrs. Welton continued. “She was my mentor. My teacher. My dearest friend. We were close—closer than family, in many ways.”
She paused, her eyes flicking to Eddie, gauging his expression. Then she went on.
“Back then, I would write letters to your father. To Robert. We were just sweethearts then. He waited patiently for me, and I promised him… once I was done, I would return. We would marry. Start a life.”
A wistful, distant smile crossed her lips. “And then the day came. I graduated. I packed my things. I was ready to leave Edenfield forever. One last night before I sailed home.”
Then her smile faded.
“That night… everything changed.”
She looked down into her teacup, as though she could see it all reflected there.
“There was smoke—fire rising from the Edenfield Palace. Screams in the Old District. Whispers everywhere. Something had happened. Something terrible.”
She shook her head slowly.
“I didn’t ask questions. I was glad I was leaving. I didn’t want to get involved.”
Then she fell quiet for a moment.
“But Catherine… she found me. Just before I was to leave. She looked different. Shaken. She was holding something in her arms.”
Mrs. Welton looked at Eddie now.
“She was holding a baby.”
Eddie’s breath caught.
“She was crying. Desperate. She begged me to take him with me. Said he wasn’t safe. That they were killing them.”
Mrs. Welton’s voice dropped to a whisper.
“I said no. Over and over again. I told her I couldn’t. I was leaving. I had my life ahead of me.”
Her eyes glistened.
“But then… he cried.”
She reached out then, gently placing her hand over Eddie’s.
“And that sound… something in it struck me. Like the world had split open. I couldn’t leave him. I couldn’t.”
Eddie’s chest felt tight.
“His name was Edward, she said. She didn’t tell me who his parents were. Only that they were gone—taken in the fire. That he was one of the Alchemists.”
Mrs. Welton leaned back slightly.
“Catherine made me promise. That I’d raise him as my own. That he would never know Edenfield—not until the time came. He wasn’t born of this world, she said, but one day… fate would call him back to it.”
She took a deep, trembling breath.
“And so I left. I brought you here. You were barely days old. And I gave you a new life. A safe one. With school trips and seaside holidays and birthday cakes.”
She smiled sadly.
“I never told Robert the whole truth. I never told you. Until now.”
Eddie sat frozen, pale, silent.
“You weren’t born in England,” Mrs. Welton said. “You weren’t even born in this world, not quite. You came from a city hidden from time, from maps, from memory. From Edenfield.”
She reached for his hand again.
“And now… it’s calling you back.”
Eddie hadn’t even realized he was holding her hand until he felt her fingers twitch under his own. Her hands were trembling—but so were his. Somehow, their grasp had steadied both.
He looked down, his voice unsteady. “Then what about… me? The things I see when I was younger—” he hesitated, searching for the right words. “When I forget my meds, the world just… unravels. I see things move. I see the molecules of things, how they’re stitched together—how they break. Things people shouldn’t be able to see.”
Mrs. Welton’s eyes softened, but there was something wary in them too. As if she had waited years for this question.
“That’s not schizophrenia,” she said gently. “At least—not in the way the world understands it.”
Eddie looked up, eyes wide.
“Catherine… Catherine saw like that too,” she continued. “She called it the Alchemist’s Vision.”
Eddie's brows furrowed. “That doesn’t even make sense. Alchemy—alchemy is just… old chemistry, isn’t it? Mixing herbs and minerals and... basically what you do with potions and medicine.”
Mrs. Welton let out a dry, amused huff.
“Oh, Eddie,” she said, shaking her head, her smile returning slightly. “You think I just bottle herbs and make peppermint tinctures? No. No. What I do is child’s play compared to real Alchemy.”
Eddie blinked.
“Alchemy isn’t about herbs,” she went on. “It’s about transformation. About the belief that nothing stays the same. Not stone. Not fire. Not even the soul.”
He sat still, listening as though the air had gone quiet just for her words.
“I don’t understand it completely,” she admitted. “It’s not my field. Illusion was my world. But Catherine? Catherine lived it. She could make a single object change form down to its essence. And not just materials—people, Eddie. Fate, memory… things you can’t just touch.”
She paused, voice tightening.
“I made a promise to her. That if you ever started showing signs—if you followed the path she predicted—I would find her again.”
Eddie looked at her, stunned. “And I did, didn’t I.”
Mrs. Welton nodded solemnly. “You did.”
A long silence followed.
“Does she still teach?” Eddie asked, his voice small, uncertain.
“I don’t know,” Mrs. Welton said honestly. “But if anyone can help you understand what you are… it’s Catherine.”
Then, as if brushing off a layer of dust from her mood, Mrs. Welton gave him a mischievous smile. “And besides,” she said, tapping his hand, “if you don’t get help before that Edenfield test in London, you’ll end up right where I warned you—you’ll be making bloody rudders in Simon’s Workshop for the rest of your life.”
Eddie let out a shaky laugh, wiping his eyes. “Yeah, and he’ll make me clean the gears with vinegar and a toothbrush again.”
“That’s right,” Mrs. Welton said, standing, her voice lifting back into something lighter. “So. Let’s not let that happen.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5E</Title>
            <Text>The familiar bustle of Edenfield University felt hollow to Eddie as he navigated its pathways. Gone was his usual easy smile, replaced by a grim determination etched on his face. In his right hand, a wad of flyers emblazoned with the chilling words &quot;Missing Person&quot; served as a constant reminder of their plight. Madeleine's smiling face, captured in the accompanying photo, only amplified the weight that settled on his heart with each step.
Eddie wasn't alone in his mission. Will, his presence a silent pillar of support, walked beside him. The once vibrant campus, teeming with student life, now seemed muted, the usual chatter replaced by hushed whispers that followed them like worried shadows. Every curious glance that lingered on their grim expressions fueled Eddie's urgency.
With each poster he slapped onto a surface - a telephone pole, a wall, a bulletin board - a flicker of hope ignited, only to be extinguished by the harsh reality of the situation. His hands trembled slightly as he secured another one, the stark contrast between Madeleine's beaming smile and the stark words above it a constant punch to the gut.
Their journey continued, a silent promise hanging heavy in the air. They would plaster Madeleine's face on every surface, their determination a testament to their unwavering friendship. As they moved from building to building.

-o-

Eddie and Will sank onto a weathered bench outside the library, their postering marathon taking its toll. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, painting the campus in a warm, melancholic glow. A cool breeze rustled through the nearby trees, carrying the faint scent of freshly cut grass and offering a momentary respite from the emotional turmoil churning within them. Each clutched a condensation-slicked beverage, the chilled liquid a small comfort against the burning worry in their hearts.
Eddie stared down at his drink, his brow furrowed in a mixture of self-reproach and despair. &quot;I should have known,&quot; he muttered, his voice heavy with regret. &quot;My own friend... part of the Black Hand. How could I have been so blind?&quot;
Will reached out, nudging him on his arm. &quot;It's not your fault, mate,&quot; He said softly. &quot;The bastard were good at hiding his true nature. No one could have expected this. Not even me.&quot;
Eddie shook his head, unconvinced. &quot;But I should have seen it. I was seeing him for months, for crying out loud! There were signs, little things that just didn't sit right. I ignored them. And now Madeleine...&quot; 
&quot;Ed, listen to me man.&quot; He said firmly. &quot;You can't blame yourself for this. You ain’t mind readers. Nobody expects you to see through people, especially when they're so deeply woven.&quot;
A heavy silence descended upon them, broken only by the distant sounds of students hurrying to their evening classes. Finally, after a long moment, Will spoke again, her voice softer now, laced with a hint of curiosity.
&quot;You cared a lot about her, didn't you, Ed?&quot; He asked, a knowing smile playing on her lips.
Eddie met his gaze, a flicker of surprise crossing his features. He hesitated for a moment, then a small, genuine smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he admitted sheepishly. &quot;More than I ever admitted… I guess.&quot;
His smile broadened, tinged with a bittersweet fondness. &quot;She’s a weird dragon girl I give you that,&quot; he chuckled, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek. &quot;But you know what? She was... Interesting, And yeah,&quot; he continued, his voice firm now, a newfound determination replacing the self-pity, &quot;she helped me out. She’s a good friend.”
Will returned his smile, his own eyes shining with fierce determination. “Then we’ll find her for sure.”
As Eddie and Will sat onto a bench outside the library, the weight of their shared sorrow momentarily lifted by the simple act of companionship
”Ed!” Ashley shouted from the distant lawn, her voice is distant and he looked so small from across the lawn,
As she closes the distance Ashley's footsteps echo against the pavement as she gets closer between them. Her arrival is unexpected but welcome, a ray of light piercing through the darkness of uncertainty.
Reaching them, Ashley stopped, her chest heaving with exertion. Her clothes were rumpled, Her black cloak hanging askew on her shoulder, a testament to his frantic dash across campus. &quot;Eddie, Will,&quot; she gasped, her voice thick with breathless anticipation. &quot;I think... I think I found something.&quot;
Eddie's posture straightened, his solemn expression morphing into one of keen interest. &quot;What's going on, Ashley?&quot; he pressed, a spark of hope igniting in his own eyes.
Ashley took a moment to catch her breath, gratefully accepting the drink Will offered and sat next to her on the stairs. &quot;I spoke with my advocacy group,&quot; she explained, downing a large gulp of the cool liquid. &quot;I thnk I know how can we find Madeleine.&quot;
“What do you mean?” Eddie asked, “What did you find?”
&quot;Maybe there's another way, Eddie,&quot; she said, her gaze fixed intently on him. &quot;What if we gather people who've also lost loved ones to the Black Hand? People who understand the pain we're going through, the desperation. People who would fight for a chance to get their loved ones back, just like us.&quot;
Eddie's eyes widened in realization. &quot;That could work,&quot; he breathed, a flicker of hope rekindled in his gaze.
&quot;Think about it,&quot; Ashley continued, her voice gaining strength. &quot;There must be others who have put up missing person posters around campus other than us, people with contact information. We could reach out to them, offer them a chance to join forces. It wouldn't be an army of trained soldiers, but an army driven by a common purpose – to bring down the Black Hand and find the people they love.&quot;
Will considered her words, a slow smile spreading across his face. &quot;A bit risky, but it might just be our best shot,&quot; he conceded.
A triumphant grin lit up Ashley's face. &quot;And you know what, Eddie?&quot; she said, her voice brimming with newfound confidence. &quot;I knew you for a fact that if you had a plan, then we're sure as heck gonna get Madeleine back.&quot;
Eddie chuckled. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he agreed, a nervous chuckle escaping his lips. &quot;We'll try.&quot;
Will straightened his shoulders, his earlier weariness replaced by a surge of renewed energy. &quot;Alright then,&quot; he declared, his voice ringing with conviction. &quot;Let's do it. We'll gather our own army.&quot;
Ashley, her grin widening, clapped Will on the back. &quot;That's the spirit, Will! Come on!&quot; she exclaimed, his excitement bubbling over.
Together, they stood united on the weathered bench, a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching darkness. The path ahead wouldn't be easy, but with a newfound purpose and a shared sense of purpose, they were ready to face whatever challenges awaited them. They would find Madeleine. They would dismantle the Black Hand. And they would do it together.

            <Title>Chapter 30 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The cold morning air bit at their skin, the mist curling around their feet as they stood on the harbor’s wooden planks. The sea stretched beyond, an endless gray expanse, the silhouettes of ships barely visible through the thick fog.
The low, resonant blast of the steamship’s horn broke through the morning mist. Deep and mournful. It blasts like a slumbering giant stirring awake. Eddie followed Catherine and everyone towards the harbour. Catherine is leaving today. The planks beneath his boots creaking faintly with the tide’s rhythm. The steamship loomed ahead, its dark silhouette emerging through the haze as smoke curled lazily from its towering funnel. The steam hiss and ropes clatter against the dock mingled with the distant cries of gulls overhead. 
Catherine adjusted the strap of her bag, shifting the weight of her luggage—now considerably heavier thanks to the codex she had yet to tell Mr. and Mrs. Welton about.
Mrs. Welton let out a deep sigh, arms crossed over her coat. “Honestly, Catherine, I don’t know what you were thinking.”
Catherine, unfazed, gave her a lopsided grin. “You’re going to have to be more specific, Ally. I think about a lot of things.”
“Oh, don’t be cheeky with me!” Mrs. Welton huffed. “Taking my children and Markus into that—whatever it was—Illusory Forest. I thought you were taking them to see some old ruins, not traipsing into actual danger!”
Catherine winced, rubbing the back of her neck. “I mean… in my defense, I never said it was just ruins.”
“You never said it wasn’t!”
“Look, they’re all fine, aren’t they? Bit of bruises, maybe some close calls, but we made it out in one piece.”
Mrs. Welton narrowed her eyes. “You and Eddie came back looking like you lost a fight with a brick wall.”
“Well,” Catherine shrugged, “The wall hit first.”
Torrie, standing beside Eddie, giggled. Markus, on the other hand, wisely kept his mouth shut, looking as though he wanted to stay out of any and all scolding.
Mrs. Welton exhaled sharply, but her expression softened. “You’re lucky you’re leaving, Catherine. Otherwise, I’d have you here scrubbing cauldrons for one hundred years as penance.”
Catherine gasped, placing a hand over her chest in mock offense. “You wound me, Alyssa.”
The ship’s horn bellowed in the distance, signaling final boarding.
The air grew a little heavier, the weight of parting settling in.

-o-

Eddie puts his hands on his pocket. His jacket provides warmth, although very little, grounding him. Around him, the dock bustled with quiet energy. Dockhands shouted to one another as they secured the ship. Travellers called out farewells to loved ones, and crates thudded against wood as loaded into the cargo hold. 
As they reached the bustling harbor, the salty sea breeze ruffled Eddie’s hair while Catherine approached the ticket booth, ticket in hand. Behind her loomed a magnificent ship destined for Edenfield, its sails billowing in the wind like a giant, proud creature. Eddie gazed up in awe, imagining himself aboard such a vessel, a prospect that seemed closer than ever if he passed his entrance exam.
The ship’s horn echoed across the misty harbor, a low, resounding call that sent a shiver through the wooden planks beneath their feet. The cold morning air was thick with salt and silence as Catherine turned to face each of them in turn, her usual grin softened by something more tender.
Mrs. Welton—Alyssa was the first. Catherine stepped forward, adjusting the strap of her bag, and met the older woman’s gaze.
“Alyssa,” she said, with rare sincerity, “thank you.”
Mrs. Welton sighed, shaking her head. “Don’t make me worry so much next time.” Then, her voice softened. “You stay safe, alright? And if you ever pass through Weshaven, our home will always welcome you.”
Catherine swallowed, her usual wit failing her for a moment. Then she smirked. “That’s very sweet of you, Alyssa… but don’t work yourself too hard, yeah? You’re not exactly young anymore.”
Mrs. Welton scoffed, smacking Catherine lightly on the arm. “Oh, shut up. I’m seventy-two, not dead.”
Catherine laughed. “Still. Try not to keel over before I visit next, alright?”
Next was Mr. Welton—Robert. Their dynamic had always been different—a student and his old mentor. Catherine studied the man before her, the apothecary’s steady hands, the slight wrinkles of experience marking his face.
“I have to say, Robert,” she said, crossing her arms, “I’m proud of you.”
Mr. Welton raised a brow. “For what?”
“For this.” Catherine gestured vaguely behind him, as if the whole of Weshaven and its quiet little apothecary were wrapped into a single point. “You took what I taught you and made it something more. You built something that lasts.”
A ghost of a smile touched Robert’s lips. “I had a good teacher.”
Catherine grinned. “Damn right, you did.”
Then came Markus. She turned to him with an appraising look, her sharp eyes scanning him like she had just seen him in a new light.
“You’re braver than you think, Markus,” she said simply. “And I mean that.”
Markus blinked in surprise. “Oh. Uh, thanks?”
Catherine chuckled. “You’re going to go places.”
Markus rubbed the back of his neck, unsure of how to respond, but the words stuck with him.
Then, Torrie. The youngest of the group, standing small in the mist, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. Her lips wobbled, but she bit them, determined not to cry.
Catherine crouched slightly to meet her eyes. “Hey,” she said gently.
Torrie sniffled. “I’ll miss you.”
Catherine ruffled her hair, grinning. “I’ll miss you too, little firecracker. But you’ll be fine. You’ve got a whole adventure ahead of you.”
Torrie nodded quickly, blinking away tears.
And then, she turned to Eddie.
“I guess this is where I’m off,” Catherine said, a playful glint in her eye as she turned to face him. “I’ll see you in a decade or so, Edward..”
“You should visit more often,” Eddie replied, a note of longing in his voice. “Torrie really enjoyed your company, you know?”
“Maybe she did,” Catherine replied, her smile fading slightly. “But I have my own matters to attend to. I don’t have much time to relax and visit family.” She paused, her expression shifting to one of quiet reflection. “In fact, why don’t you visit me instead? If you go through and accepted in your entrance exam, you’ll be boarding this exact same ship toward Edenfield. Our paths might cross again someday.”
“Yeah, indeed,” Eddie said, his smile returning as hope sparked within him. “Take care of yourself.”
With a flourish, Catherine stepped onto the dock, her red overcoat dancing dramatically in the sea wind, creating a striking silhouette against the backdrop of the ship. Eddie stood rooted in place, watching as the ship began to pull away, his aunt’s elven ears and tall figure becoming a fading outline against the horizon.
As the ship sailed further into the distance, Eddie turned on his heel, determination surging through him. He made his way back toward the train station, the rhythm of the waves echoing in his mind.
If I go in the entrance exam, If I got accepted, I’ll be boarding that exact same ship.
No, he thought fiercely, I will go to the entrance exam. 
I will board that ship towards Edenfield.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stirred awake. Blinking against the soft sunlight that streamed through the stained-glass panels above. Gone were the dark woods and the weight of exhaustion. Instead, he found himself in a spacious, vibrant ward he didn’t recognise. The sunlight cast warm red, blue, and green hues across the room. It refracts off the intricate stained-glass windows. 

Rows of clean beds stretched out before him. Each of them is separated by shimmering silk curtains. The curtains caught the sunlight, creating a soft glow. The air was thick with an unsettling peace—too muted for comfort. Faint murmurs of incantations and the soft hum of magic filled the air. Healers, clad in flowing robes that ripple like water, moved gracefully from bed to bed. Their hands glowed as they worked. Their whispers of healing spells were gentle, but to Eddie, they stirred an unease deep inside him. 

His body felt heavy like he was sinking into the plush mattress beneath him. He glanced down at his chest. Bandages wrapped tightly around his chest. He could smell the faint, herbal scent of salves beneath the cloth. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose hospital robe. The memory of the Deep Glaive, Catherine, and the Nightingale Fox flickered in his mind. He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the fight. 

The air seemed charged, but it wasn’t the comforting hum of everyday magic. This was a more profound, more potent force—a place of magic meant to heal, but not the kind Eddie was used to. He didn’t trust it. He glanced around warily, trying to shake off the lingering fog from his blackout. Where was he? And what had these healers done to him while he was unconscious? 

Eddie looked around. He turned his head and noticed a small cupcake on the side table beside his bed. Beside it, a familiar little box rested, its lid slightly ajar. His heart lifted a little at the sight, recognising the playful touch. Two folded notes lay beside the cupcake, each written in distinct, familiar handwriting. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 12 V2</Title>
            <Text>The wooden creak and clacking of horse hoofs filled the journey after Eddie, Torrie, Markus and Catherine boarded the carriage that agreed to take them to Gunther’s Farm, that is the northernmost point the carriage is willing to take them.
Scents of hay and the faint earthy breeze drifting through the open sides of the carriage. Eddie sat quietly, his gaze fixed on the passing fields, The rifle sat leaning on his shoulder. Catherine, ever the scholar, kept stealing glances at the weapon. Finally, her curiosity got the better of her. 
Catherine then reaches her hand to touch one of the engravings.
But as usual, Eddie swatter her hands away.
“Come on, Edward.” Catherine sighed, “Can’t I get just a little touch of it?”
“No, Catherine.” Eddie reminded, “Dad said so.”
“Humph,” Catherine said in mock pout, “Have it your way then.”
Markus and Torrie laughed at the exchange, but Catherine is far from over, she continued,
&quot;But I've been meaning to ask about that flintlock of yours. It's not exactly what you see every day, especially for someone helping out at the apothecary.&quot; 
&quot;It's more of a hand-me-down, I guess,&quot; he sighed, &quot;Back when Weshaven was still full of Streamwyrms, Dad taught my brother Alfred how to use it. Alfred would go into the shore with the others and scare off anything too close to the Apothecary. Sometimes, he'd even shoot them if they were too bold.&quot; 
“Streamwyrms? What’s that?” Torrie asked,
“It’s those fishes coming out of the shores every August, remember? Sharp teeth, four legs, you were almost bitten by one last summer.”
“Oh those!” Torrie said, “But they are so cute, why did Alfred shoot them?”
“No they aren’t cute, Torrie, they’re pest!” Eddie hissed
Catherine tilted her head, her gaze flicking back to the rifle. &quot;And now? I assume there aren't any Streamwyrms around anymore.&quot; 
&quot;Not really,&quot; Eddie replied. &quot;They still comes out of the shores every August, since Alfred’s not around, I takes his place, but honestly Markus was much more better shot than me, so I haven't had to use this thing in ages. Honestly, it's just been collecting dust.&quot; 
&quot;So why bring it now?&quot; Catherine pressed, a note of curiosity creeping into her tone. 
“Eh,” Eddie shrugged. &quot;Because it's cool.&quot; 
“You just said that Robert asked you to take it.” Catherine said
“But it’s still cool nonetheless.”
“Since it’s oh so cool,” Catherine said theatrically, “You would let me touch them.”
“No!”

-o-
The carriage came to a slow, creaking halt in front of a farmstead, a modest property framed by sprawling fields and a weathered wooden fence. The farmhouse stood stoically against the horizon, its roof patched in places and its walls bearing the marks of years spent braving the elements. A few chickens scattered at the sound of the wheels stopping, clucking indignantly as the group prepared to step down.
The driver gave the reins a gentle flick. “Here we are. Gunther’s Farm. Northernmost point, just like I said.”
Eddie was the first to hop off, his boots crunching against the dirt path as he turned to help Torrie down. She leaped with an exaggerated flourish, as if pretending she were dismounting a noble steed. Markus followed, stretching his arms and squinting at the farm with mild curiosity. Catherine climbed down last, brushing her red coat off with an air of elegance—until the driver called out.
“Right, miss. That’ll be two silver for the lot of you.”
Catherine froze mid-motion, her hand lingering in her pocket as she turned to the driver with a sheepish smile. “Ah… I think…”
The driver looked more unamused.
“I… seem to have misplaced my coin satchel…” Catherine said, her voice uncharacteristically hesitant. She glanced back at the group. “Eddie, darling,” she said, flashing an overly sweet smile. “Be a dear and lend me a bit, would you?”
Eddie looked at Catherine, seemingly taken aback by her uncharastically sweet and regal tone.
“What.” Eddie said
“I misplaced my coin purse.”
“You spent all your coins didn’t you—“
“I said I misplaced it. Happens to the best of us, you know.” 

Eddie frowned and reluctantly dug into his pouch, fishing out two silver coins and handing them to the driver, who nodded in thanks and clicked his tongue to set the horses moving again.
As the carriage rolled away, Eddie turned to Catherine with a raised brow. “You’re a master alchemist, and you don’t have two silver to your name?”
“Exactly,” Catherine said, “Also I’m not just a Master Alchemist, Edward. I’m a Travelling Master Alchemist, and that is why I accepted that gig!.”
“I sometimes wonder how my younger self could even idolise you.”

            <Notes>Who wants what? Why can’t they have it?

Catherine wants to get the Artefact of the Groville ruins

What will they do to get it?

By going to the illusory forest

Who Cares? What happen if they don’t get it?

Catherine cares, because if she didn’t get it, the Merchants won’t pay her, and she won’t be able to pay her ticket back to Edenfield.

What is the good news?

The road is mostly safe because of the Travellers Road

What is the bad news?

The Dragon still lurks

            <Title>Chapter 13 V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie, Torrie, Markus and Catherine continued their journey northward. Sea of tall green grass sways rhythmically as a gentle breeze carried the scent of sea from the shore. Their shadows stretched long and lean under the waning sunlight. The land ahead gradually sloped upward, and as they crested a small hill, the forest of Deep Glaive came into view.
At first glance, it seemed like just a newly planted tree farm. A scattered cluster of saplings, small bushes, and a few modestly sized trees lined the edge. 
Markus stopped and glanced around his surroundings.
&quot;This is it, ma’am?&quot; he asked, glancing at Catherine. &quot;The infamous Deep Glaive… Doesn’t seem so... deep. Looks more like a glorified garden.&quot;
&quot;That’s because you’re standing on the shallow end,&quot; Catherine replied.
&quot;Shallow end? What’s that supposed to mean?&quot; Markus asked back
&quot;The Deep Glaive isn’t an ordinary forest.” Catherine said, turning toward him, gesturing to the trees ahead. “It’s Illusory in nature, in a way. It mimics the ocean. The closer you stay to the edges, the smaller everything seems. But as you go deeper...&quot; She trailed off, her gaze drifting to the horizon.
“What… happens as we go deeper?&quot; Markus frowned.
&quot;The trees grow larger. The creatures more dangerous. The forest doesn’t just grow—it transforms,&quot; Catherine explained, her tone steady but laced with a hint of caution. &quot;It’s why they call it the Deep Glaive. You won’t understand the depth of it until you’re in the deep end.&quot;
&quot;Great…” Markus sighed, “That’s... comforting to hear.&quot;
“Don’t worry, Markus.” Eddie said, patting his friend on the back, “I’m sure we’ll figure things out.”
“If things go bad…” Eddie continued, “We have a certain Elf to sue.”
“Not funny, Edward.” Catherine said.
The group pressed onward, stepping into the forest’s threshold. As they ventured deeper into the forest, the world around them grew quieter. Their footsteps and the distant calls of seabirds were the sounds they could hear. 
The path they had been following gave way to a darker earth. The green swaying grasses disappear beneath layers of dark earth. The group began approaching the middle of the Deep Glaive. The sun was now just a sliver on the horizon, casting the last rays of daylight through the trees. As they drew nearer, the forest ahead seemed almost unremarkable—a large cluster of trees, their branches swaying gently in the evening breeze. But as they crossed the threshold into the forest, the air seemed to shift. 
It became cooler, denser, and more damp. The small, trees and saplings they saw before had passed, now the trees are taller, bigger and thicker. Their trunks twists, and their canopies stretched higher into the sky that began to get covered more and more. The underbrush, once sparse, now teemed with strange, luminescent flora, casting an otherworldly glow on the path ahead.
Eddie glanced at Markus, who was inspecting one of the emissive flowers clinging to a nearby trunk. 
&quot;Do you feel something?&quot; Eddie asked, his voice hushed.
&quot;Yeah…&quot; Markus replied, brushing his fingers across the moss. &quot;The air here is denser… it’s like swimming.&quot;
“That’s one weird way to put it…” Eddie said, “But I agree with you.”
Torrie trailed behind them. She looked up, craning her neck to take in the towering trees. 
The barks of the trees spiraled skyward, their leaves forming an interwoven canopy so thick it blocked out the remnants of the sun light. Shadows danced across her freckled face, and her voice piped up, soft but curious. 
&quot;Is it night already?&quot; Torrie asked, looking around.
&quot;Not quite,&quot; Catherine said, who is in the front most of the group. Her apple-red hair shimmered faintly, catching the luminescence of the forest flora. 
&quot;The deeper we go, the larger the forest grows, remember?” Catherine continued, “The Deep Glaive is not just a place, but a world within itself. Like the ocean, it swells with depth. The trees grow taller because we’re swimming deeper.&quot;
&quot;So…” Torrie said as she looked around her, “Is it like we’re walking into... another layer of reality?&quot;
&quot;You can say it like that,&quot; Catherine said, stepping forward again. &quot;The Deep Glaive is an ancient place, shaped by elven spells older than any of us. Even myself. It doesn’t follow the rules of the outside world.&quot;
“Older than you, huh?” Eddie interjected, “This thing must be pre-historic.”
Markus chuckled softly as he joined Catherine, tapping the flask on his belt. &quot;And yet, here we are, bringing mundane supplies into a place like this. It’s humbling, isn’t it?&quot;
As they ventured further, the luminescent plants grew brighter, painting the towering trees in hues of blue and green. The hum grew louder, joined by faint rustlings in the dense underbrush. Shadows flickered at the edges of their vision, always just appearing in his peripheral.
&quot;Are we in the center of the forest yet?&quot; Torrie broke the silence.
&quot;Not quite,&quot; Catherine said, gesturing toward the dense wall of trees ahead. &quot;But we will be at The Gates in a few moment.&quot;
&quot;The Gates?&quot; Torrie echoed.
&quot;The Gates to the forest’s center.” Catherine explained, “If you know where to look—and what to do—you can open them. And lucky for you… I just knew where to look and what to do.&quot;
&quot;That is great Catherine but...” Eddie said as he adjusted the strap of his satchel and the rifle on his back, “How exactly do we ‘open’ them?&quot;
&quot;Follow me,&quot; Catherine said, Leading the way forward.

            <Title>Chapter 9</Title>
            <Text>The breeze continues to blow despite his raging thought. Eddie let out a long sigh, the mist of his breath flutters in the cold evening air as he did so. He walked down the uneven cobblestones of the harbour road. The faint murmur of waves lapping against the pier faded behind him, leaving just the smooth cadence of his feet on the sidewalk. Above, the moon stood high, throwing a weak reflection on Weshaven's damp roads. 
Catherine is already nowhere to be gound, in her usual manner. One minute she was at his side, her words pierced something within him he hadn't felt in years, giving him the existential crisis of a lifetime; the next, she was gone, as if nothing had just happened.
Eddie walked, stuffing his hands into his coat pockets, his breath formed a mist everything he sighed. Catherine's words remained in his memory, playing over and over like a broken record.
What happened to you? 
Eddie still didn't want to acknowledge how deeply the question had pierced him. He remembered her face, how uncharacteristically serious it looked. How seriously dejected it looked, and how within all of that, how concerned it looked.
As he moved through the streets, the distant noises of the port gave way to the faint echoes of excited conversation and laughing. Eddie stopped as he rounded a corner. 
On the town square of Mariner’s Ranch stood a little, old carriage with brightly fading paint on its sides that depicted legendary heroes and mythological animals. A banner with the words &quot;Vandruff’s Travelling Tales&quot; in gold calligraphy was draped over its front; the wording faintly reflected the light from a nearby street lamps. 
Eddie stood still. He had grown up loving evenings like these, when storytellers from different lands would bring their tales to this little hamlet called Weshaven. Knights would fight monsters and tricksters outwitted monarchs.
He remembered back when he was a kid, pushing his way to the front row, with all eyes fixed on the little stage. Back then he still believed in knights defeating the dragons, Back then he still believed in happy endings. Back then, the world beyond the stage was irrelevant for a few mere seconds as he watched these tales unfold.
 However, it was years ago, when he was someone different, someone who could lose himself in heroic and adventurous stories without thinking twice. 
You just need to be you.
The words continues to repeat in his minds, their simplicity belying the weight they contained. Now, what does that even mean? Who was &quot;him&quot; ? The Eddie she recalled? Before everything went wrong, was he the Eddie he was? 
“Thank you! Dear audience!” Announced the Puppet Master, “The next tale, is The Dragon of Groville!”
Eddie was startled out of his reverie by the children's quiet laughter. To the joy of the audience, one of the puppets—a cunning fox, apparently—had taken the knight's sword and was bouncing about the stage. Despite his advanced age, the puppet master's motions were vibrant as he laughed with them. 
Eddie remembered how he was used to be one of those children, laughing and having the time of his life.
He remembered what he told Catherine a while before, how he wasn’t that kid anymore. How he had grown, how he had lost his passion.
Well, let’s see whether that little Eddie was still there somewhere, Eddie thought to himself.
Before he could second-guess himself, Eddie walked up to the booth. 
The ticket booth near the carriage had the words &quot;Admission: 2 Coppers&quot; written on it. He dug into his pocket, his fingers brushing against a few coins. 
It was ridiculous, a somewhat inebriated, unkempt man purchasing a ticket to a puppet show. But the thought of sitting in the warm glow of the lanterns, surrounded by stories, felt like a tether to a simpler time, back when he was still a kid, back when that kid was still alive. 
The vendor handed him a small red ticket in exchange for the coins. Eddie muttered a quick thanks before slipping into the small gathering. 
The children’s laughter drowned him out as he settled at the back, their chatter a vibrant wall of sound. His dark coat and weathered boots made him stand out against the cheerful patchwork of colourful scarves and jackets the children wore. 
Over the little stage, which was embellished with painted stars, trees, and a bright moon, the lanterns created a lovely, flickering light. A wiry old guy with a sparkle in his eye, the puppeteer emerged and opened the play with a theatrical flourish. 
“Now! Onto the next tale! Gather thee close, good folk,” the puppeteer intoned, his voice deep and inviting, “And hearken thee to a tale of old—a tale of valour, cunning, and the strength of noble hearts. ‘Tis the story of Groville, a village fair, and the fearsome foe known as the Nightingale Dragon!” 
Eddie leaned back. As the stage came alive with colourful puppets, he couldn’t help but feel the nostalgia seeping in. 
The puppeteer brought out the Groville puppet, a cheerful little village bustling with tiny puppet villagers: “Behold, a day most fair and bounteous!” 
The puppeteer introduced the puppet of The Alchemist next, a regal figure robed in Red. “Stand ye strong, good folk!” the old man declared in a commanding voice, the puppet raising its glowing staff. “Together shall we face this darkness, and ne’er shall we let it consume our light!” 
Eddie’s smile faded as the story unfolded. The Alchemist couldn’t fight the Nightingale Fox alone; she needed the help of others—a cunning Witch and a valiant Bard. The puppets joined forces, their combined strengths weaving a glowing barrier around the village.
The battle was fierce, the air heavy with the Fox’s fiery wrath and the trio’s resolve. Intently, Eddie watched, the children’s eager sounds receding. 
“Thou shalt harm no more, vile beast!” The Alchemist cried. “By this bond of light, shadow, and song, I banish thee to the deep forest, where none may find thee!” 
The Fox puppet was drawn into the shadowy forest, its flames extinguished. The village erupted in cheers as the puppeteer guided the tiny villagers into a jubilant dance. 
“And so, my friends,” the puppeteer said, his voice solemn now, “remember this tale well. True strength is not in power or might, but in courage, wisdom, and the bonds we share. Let thy hearts be brave, thy spirits steadfast, and thy light unyielding.” 
As the puppets took a bow and the curtain closed, the children’s enthusiastic clapping and laughter filled the air. Eddie sat unmoving, the storyteller’s words echoing in his head. True strength is in the bonds we share. 
The children cheered, their applause echoing in the night as the old puppet master took a bow, his smile as warm as the lantern light. Eddie clapped too, though his hands moved slowly, the sound almost drowned out by the surrounding kids. 
Back then, he’d believed in happy endings.
The children leaned forward, their wide eyes reflecting the warm glow of the lanterns. Eddie stayed where he was, his head bowed slightly.
Courage, Wisdom, and Bonds.
The words twisting in his chest. Catherine’s voice echoed in his mind, her words overlapping with the puppet master’s. What happened to you? You just need to be you.
But who was he now? A stranger sitting among children, trying to grasp at a piece of his past that no longer fit. He could laugh at the absurdity of it all if it didn’t hurt so much.
As the crowd began to disperse, Eddie lingered in his seat, watching the children scamper off with their parents, their laughter filling the air.
Eddie stood and brushed the dust from his coat. The streets felt quieter now, the cold breeze of the night settling in again. 
He shoved his hands into his pockets, The breeze continues to blow despite his raging thought. Eddie let out a long sigh, the mist of his breath flutters in the cold evening air as he did so. He walked down the uneven cobblestones of the harbour road. His footsteps echoing as he made his way back to the apothecary.

Eddie attending his first class, and in that first Alchemy class, he already have to buy five different books, all of which are expensive and he couldn’t buy even with his scholarship allowance from Sage, he wanted to borrow from his friends, but Eddie hadn’t made any friends in Alchemy

Eddie had complained to Will, but Will is also stuck, Ashley too. and they had also need to buy books. Will always have a way to stay In his friend’s place to study, or the library, Ashley work part time jobs to save money for her books. Eddie, however has no friends nor has he got any time left to take part time jobs,

Eddie eventually kidnapped by a mysterious individual, they said that they had scouted Eddie from afar, they said they are from a secret organisation, after some comedic moments, they revealed themself as The Book Pirates, and they can help Eddie out, in return, they want Eddie to help them in acquiring books. For every book he acquire from their list, he can have one book from their copies. They count it from the page number

Eddie’s involvement in The Book Pirates, organisation of poorer students who believed that the right of knowledge should spread to all men, and book should be free, and therefore they either borrowed of stole books and copied them in their self-made copying machines

Bad guys close in: 

As the rumours spread, people starts to get suspicious, Ashley in particular wanted to know the root cause of this chimaera plot, asked Madeleine whether she knows something about it

Madeleine was angered when she learnt about that the Chimaera Rumors are true, Madeleine is a huge advocate of animals and most importantly Mythical Creatures, and knowing that they still cut them up alive and stitch them together doesn’t sit right with her, and she wanted to investigate the truth behind the Chimaeras.

            <Text>The cobblestones beneath their feet gradually gave way to packed dirt. Catherine's staff's rhythmic clicking softened on the more forgiving ground. Earthy scents of tilled soil and hay replaced the fish markets and harbour smells of salt and brine. Weathered barns with peeling paint stood amidst sprawling fields, and the occasional farmhouse, smoke curling lazily from its chimneys, dotted the horizon.
Eddie walked, the rifle strapped across his back, swaying slightly with his steps. Catherine, ever the scholar, kept stealing glances at the weapon. Finally, her curiosity got the better of her.
&quot;Eddie,&quot; she began, her tone casual but probing, &quot;I've been meaning to ask about that flintlock of yours. It's not exactly what you see every day, especially for someone working at an apothecary.&quot;
Eddie sighed lightly as though he had anticipated the question. &quot;It's more of a hand-me-down, I guess,&quot; he said, adjusting the strap on his shoulder. &quot;Back when Weshaven was still full of wolves and wild animals, Dad taught my brother Alfred how to use it. Alfred would go into the woods and scare off anything too close to the farms. Sometimes, he'd even shoot them if they were too bold.&quot;
Torrie, who had been eavesdropping, piped up with wide-eyed enthusiasm. &quot;Wait, like actual wolves? Did Alfred ever fight one off?&quot;
Eddie chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;No, it never got that dramatic. Most of the time, the sound of the shot was enough to send them running.&quot;
&quot;Boo,&quot; Torrie pouted, twirling her wand idly. &quot;I thought we were finally hearing a good action story.&quot;
Catherine tilted her head, her gaze flicking back to the rifle. &quot;And now? I assume there aren't any wolves around anymore.&quot;
&quot;Not really,&quot; Eddie replied. &quot;There's a Hunting Guild that takes care of stuff like that. They meet at the Swordfish Pub. They keep the area safe, so I haven't had to use this thing in ages. Honestly, it's just been collecting dust.&quot;
&quot;So why bring it now?&quot; Catherine pressed, a note of curiosity creeping into her tone.
Eddie shrugged, a small, sheepish smile forming. &quot;Because it's cool.&quot;
Catherine couldn't hold back her laughter this time. Her composed facade broke for a moment. Eddie smirked, shaking his head at Torrie's antics.
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he said, his voice edged with mock exasperation. &quot;Let's just hope none of you are begging me for help when something shows up.&quot;
Markus clapped Eddie on the back, his grin widening. &quot;If something does, I'll ask the bard in Swordfish to make a song about you. 'Eddie Welton and the Rusty Rifle.' Has a nice ring, doesn't it?&quot;
The group's laughter echoed across the dirt road. The distant lowing of cows and the rustling of leaves in the breeze filled the air. However, the tension of the morning still lingered in Eddie's mind. He couldn't help but feel a flicker of warmth amidst the camaraderie.
-o-
As they ventured into the gathering dusk, the world around them grew quieter. Their footsteps and the distant calls of seabirds were the sounds they could hear. The path ahead was long, and the mysteries of the Deep Glaive awaited.
The path they had been following gave way to a darker earth. The cobblestones disappear beneath layers of fallen leaves. Catherine's party is approaching the edge of the Deep Glaive. The sun was now just a sliver on the horizon, casting the last rays of daylight through the trees. As they drew nearer, the forest ahead seemed almost unremarkable—a small cluster of trees, their branches swaying gently in the evening breeze.
But as they crossed the threshold into the forest, the air seemed to shift. It became cooler, denser, and more vibrant. The small, unassuming trees began to grow taller. Their trunks thickened, and their canopies stretched higher into the sky. The underbrush, once sparse, now teemed with strange, luminescent flora, casting an otherworldly glow on the path ahead.
Catherine was the first to react, her eyes widening in astonishment as she took in the sight before her. &quot;Look at it... It's more incredible than I imagined.&quot; Awe filled her voice, each word a reverent whisper. She stepped forward, her fingers lightly grazing the bark of a nearby tree, which seemed to pulse gently beneath her touch. &quot;I've read about the Deep Glaive in countless texts, but seeing it in person... It's like stepping into another world.&quot;
Torrie, who had been trailing behind her, was equally mesmerised. Her gaze darted from one glowing plant to the next, and her hands were itching to gather samples. &quot;It's like the trees are alive... I mean, really alive,&quot; she murmured, her voice tinged with the wonder of a child seeing magic for the first time. She turned to Catherine, her eyes sparkling. Catherine, can we collect some of these? Just imagine the experiments we could conduct!&quot;
Catherine chuckled softly, her earlier playful demeanour returning as she nodded. &quot;Yes, but let's not be too hasty, Torrie. People know the Deep Glaive for its beauty, but also its dangers. We must tread carefully.&quot;
Markus, who had been lingering at the back, stepped forward. Quiet reverence replaced his usually cheerful expression. He glanced around, his eyes wide with both fear and fascination. &quot;I didn't expect it to be so... vast. It's like the forest goes on forever.&quot; He let out a shaky breath, rubbing the back of his neck as he tried to steady his nerves.
Eddie stood apart from the others. He watched their reactions with a sense of detachment. He had read about the Deep Glaive in his academy days and studied its mysteries. His younger self would have been giddy with excitement. He would be eager to explore every inch of this magical place. But now, as he looked around at the towering trees and the glowing plants, he felt a dull sense of indifference.
It's just a forest, he thought to himself. Trees, plants, maybe a few magical creatures—nothing special.
He knew the theory behind the forest's strange properties. Its size was an illusion, and it seemed to stretch endlessly for those who ventured inside. But knowing the how and why stripped away the wonder. He saw what others saw as extraordinary as simply the result of magical phenomena he had once been so passionate about, now reduced to nothing more than trivial facts in his mind.
Catherine turned to him, her eyes still wide with excitement. &quot;Eddie, isn't this just amazing? I remember how you used to talk about places like this when you were a child. You were always so eager to see them for yourself.&quot;
Eddie forced a smile, nodding politely. &quot;It's impressive, I suppose.&quot;
Catherine blinked, surprised by his lack of enthusiasm. She studied him momentarily as if trying to reconcile the man before her with the boy she remembered. &quot;Still, there's something magical about being here in person, don't you think?&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eddie shrugged, his expression neutral. &quot;I think so.&quot;
Catherine, undeterred by Eddie's indifference, smiled warmly at the group. &quot;Alright, let's not waste any more time. We've got work to do, and the Deep Glaive won't wait for us. Stay close, and remember—this forest may be beautiful, but it's also unpredictable.&quot;
As they ventured deeper into the forest. Catherine and Torrie continued to marvel at their surroundings. Markus followed closely, his nerves slowly easing as he became more accustomed to the strange sights around him.
Eddie walked a few steps behind, his rifle still slung across his back, his gaze focused ahead. He knew there were wonders in the Deep Glaive that would have once thrilled him beyond measure. But now, they were just another reminder of the life he had left behind and the magic he no longer cared to understand. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 2 V2</Title>
            <Text>The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by the second floor’s oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 

-o-

Beyond the attic door, the room lay in comfortable chaos.
Dim morning light filtered through the thick curtains, spilling in slivers across the wooden floor in long golden beams. Dust floated lazily in the shafts of sunlight, twinkling like tiny stars suspended midair—silent witnesses to the stillness of the space.
Clothes were strewn across the room in a manner that suggested intention, though none could discern it. A crumpled hoodie draped over the back of a chair like a flag at half-mast. Socks lounged beneath the radiator like they had retired there. A faded pair of jeans curled beneath the edge of the bed, only half-visible in the shadows.
The walls still wore old posters from Eddie’s younger days—peeling corners, sun-bleached edges. One of them, a diagram of the periodic table, sagged on a single thumbtack like it had long since given up trying to inspire anyone.
Books were stacked on every available surface—beside the bed, by the window, across the desk. Their cracked spines told stories of long hours and frayed patience. School textbooks sat beside more peculiar reads: Advanced Chemical Interactions, Molecules of the Mind, Living With Schizophrenia: A Guide for Young Adults, and The ADHD Brain and You. A few had notes scribbled in the margins, messy thoughts that began with certainty and trailed off mid-sentence.
And slumped over it all, as if weighed down by the very air, was the room’s lone occupant.
Eddie’s maroon diamond-patterned sweater hung loose over his narrow shoulders, its sleeves pushed up to his elbows. His brown hair, in desperate need of a comb, fell haphazardly over his forehead. He was hunched at his desk, arms folded into a makeshift pillow, the curve of his back almost apologetic. His breath moved gently through parted lips, steady and quiet, the only sign of life in the attic retreat.
His laptop lay open before him, screen dimmed, still glowing faintly in the dust-light. Around it were drafts of scholarship applications, their wording clumsy with uncertainty. A few rejection emails sat crumpled nearby—folded too many times, like they might eventually disappear if bent enough. One fresh letter remained unsent, cursor blinking on an unfinished sentence: “Though I may not meet the usual criteria, I believe I…”
It blinked again. Waiting.
And Eddie slept on, caught in that strange space between exhaustion and escape, unaware of the morning pressing gently against the glass.
The knocking at the door continued. A soft, measured rhythm, persistent against the wood.
Still, he did not stir. Succumbing to his sleep and the sounds from distant lands.

-o-


Mrs. Welton knocked again—more resolutely this time, as if the sound itself could unravel the silence that enveloped the room.
“Eddie?” she called once more, Still, no answer.
She let out a sigh. “Of course,” she murmured to herself, “I knew it’d come to this.”
A brief glance over her shoulder. Then another down the staircase. She listened for footsteps—Torrie’s light tread. but the house remained still, the kind of quiet that lent itself to secrets.
Just to be sure, she descended a single step, peering down into the hallway. No one. She turned back, her movements measured and discreet.
Slipping a hand into the folds of her skirt, her fingers found the smooth curve of polished wood. The piece of wood was warm to the touch, as if it had been waiting for her. 
With a flick of her wrist, it slid free into her palm—a slender rod of dark oak, its surface carved with intricate, interlocking patterns that shimmered faintly in the gloom.
Mrs. Welton glanced once more over her shoulder.
She raised the wand toward the old door. Its lock, long mundane to any outsider, shimmered faintly with worn runes when the tip of her wand hovered near. With a practiced flick and a silent invocation, a gentle click echoed in the stillness. The runes pulsed faintly, then faded like dew retreating into the morning shadows.
She exhaled quietly, tucked the wand back into her pocket, and placed her hand on the door handle. No hesitation now—just the fluid grace of someone who had done this before.
With a soft turn, she opened the door as though nothing had happened.
And stepped inside.
The room was full of clutter.
Mrs. Welton’s gaze swept over the battlefield of clothes, scattered papers, and forgotten mugs. Her eyebrows lifted slightly as she took in the disarray.
“Of course,” she muttered under her breath, stepping carefully over a crumpled tunic on the floor. “A storm couldn’t have done a better job.”
She pressed her lips together, her eyes locking on the slouched figure at the desk. Eddie lay folded over it, unmoving save for the slow, steady rise and fall of his breathing. One earphone dangled from his ear, leaking the faint, fuzzy crackle of some melancholic rock song—an old track warped by overuse and low volume. The laptop before him glowed dully, flickering over a mess of open tabs and document files.
She took a cautious step forward.
Then another.
Each step was measured—careful not to crunch loose paper or bump the old wooden chair leaning precariously nearby. Her eyes flicked from the scattered textbooks to the fading posters, to the cracked spine of a self-help manual barely holding together with tape.
Closer.
She inched around the bedpost. A sock clung to the side of her shoe. She kicked it off with quiet precision.
Closer.
Eddie muttered something unintelligible in his sleep, shifting slightly. Mrs. Welton froze mid-step, heart thudding. Her hand hovered just above his slumped shoulder.
A beat passed.
Then, without warning—
“Edward Welton!”
Her voice cracked like a whip across the attic. Sharp, commanding, but undercut with the unmistakable warmth of exasperated affection.
Eddie jolted awake so violently that his chair tipped backward in an instant.
His arms flailed, knocking aside a stack of notes. The earphone ripped from his ear with a sharp crackle of static—only for the rock music to burst full-volume from his laptop speakers.
“GAAH—!”
Books, letters, and rejection slips erupted into the air, cascading like parade confetti. One slapped him in the face. Another spiraled like a leaf into a coffee-stained sock.
His foot caught something—possibly a textbook, possibly his own sense of dignity—and the chair’s back legs gave way completely. Eddie went down with a theatrical, graceless thud, hitting the floor hard enough to rattle the desk.
The music kept playing.
From somewhere on the ground, he groaned.
“…morning, Mum.”
Mrs. Welton stood tall over the wreckage of her son, arms crossed, hands perched sternly on her hips. The look she gave him could’ve curdled fresh milk.
“You agreed weeks ago to accompany Torrie on her first day of school,” she snapped. “I’m not letting her get lost on the way while you spend all morning oversleeping!”
Eddie groaned as he sat up, his maroon sweater sliding off one shoulder, his hair sticking up in several absurd directions. He rubbed his head, blinking blearily like someone dragged out of a dream. “Mom... Could you at least knock first?” he grumbled, voice still hoarse from sleep.
Then, a beat passed. His eyes narrowed. “Wait.” He glanced at the door. “I locked my room. How the hell did you get in?”
“First thing, language,” Mrs. Welton retorted, brows raised.
“Second thing, I did knock,” she added with a huff, pointing pointedly at the now-open door like it betrayed him. “But you were too busy listening to—” she waved a hand toward the tangled mess of earphones and charging cables, the laptop still blaring jagged electric guitar riffs under a screeching vocal line, “—whatever that is.”
Eddie rolled his eyes, reaching up to his keyboard. With a single tap, the chaos cut to silence.
“It’s rock, Mum,” he muttered, as if that alone granted him cultural immunity. “There’s this new band. Their songs are pretty neat—”
“Like I care about that, Edward!” she interrupted sharply, eyes narrowing. “Now get up, before your sister’s late for her first day in secondary school!”

Eddie groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. &quot;Secondary school?&quot; he muttered, his voice still thick with sleep. &quot;Torrie’s in secondary school now?&quot;
Mrs. Welton pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;She is. Did you forget that too?&quot;
&quot;Look, Mum,&quot; Eddie pushed himself up, wincing as he untangled his legs from a mess of books and crumpled clothes. &quot;It’s difficult to keep track of things when I need to send away letters and doing test every two days.&quot; He stretched, his back popping as he tried to shake off the last bits of sleep. &quot;Can I clean up a bit before we go?&quot;
Mrs. Welton bent down with a sigh, picking up the books and papers that had scattered across the floor. Unlike Eddie, who left things in precarious heaps, she stacked them neatly, smoothing out crumpled pages before placing them back onto his desk.
&quot;You should at least try to keep things organized,&quot; she scolded, adjusting a pile of chemistry notes. &quot;Honestly, Edward, I don’t know how you can work like this.&quot;
&quot;I do work like this,&quot; Eddie shot back as he pulled a fresh shirt from a chair—though it was debatable how fresh it actually was. He gave it a quick sniff before pulling it on. &quot;I’ve been busy applying to universities you know? Oxford, Cambridge, Saint Andrews. It’s not like I’m just lounging about.&quot;
Mrs. Welton, still tidying with a kind of surgical disdain, hesitated as she adjusted a stack of papers. “Have you… given any thought to that other university I mentioned a few months ago?” she asked, her tone deliberately casual.
Eddie frowned. “You’ve mentioned loads of places, Mum. That one in Manchester the Bakers recommended. Then Durham because Mrs. Withers’ son went there. And something about a marine biology course even though I hate boats.” He paused. “Which one now?”
“Edenfield University,” she said, like it should have been obvious. “The one where your Aunt Catherine teaches.”
Eddie turned to face her slowly. “Edenfield?”
“Yes.”
A pause.
Eddie squinted at her like he’d misheard. “That’s not real.”
Mrs. Welton gave him a confused look. “What do you mean, not real?”
“I mean,” Eddie said, brushing a hand through his hair, “I looked. I looked everywhere. Edenfield University doesn’t exist. There’s no website, no rankings, no Wikipedia page, no contact details—nothing. I even tried looking up Aunt Catherine, and surprise—no record of her.” His voice rose slightly, more incredulous than angry. “You keep saying you studied there. But how can a university that doesn’t exist have alumni? Or staff?”
Mrs. Welton said nothing for a moment. She was still, like someone trying to recall a dream she was sure she had. Then she gave a tight, almost dismissive shake of the head.
“Just because it’s not on the internet doesn’t mean it isn’t real,” she said quietly. “Not everything worth knowing is searchable, Edward.”
That only deepened his confusion. “Mum. It’s 2025. Everything has some kind of digital footprint. At least one mention. But Edenfield? It’s like it’s been scrubbed out of existence.”
Mrs. Welton met his gaze, her expression unreadable now. “All I’m saying is… maybe you’re not looking in the right place.”
She reached into her cardigan pocket, producing a small hairbrush. Without asking, she began taming the wild thatch of hair on his head, tutting as she did so.
“Mum,” he whined, ducking away, “I’m eighteen, not eight.”
“Then start acting like it,” she said, planting the brush on his desk. “Five minutes. Downstairs. Or I’m taking Torrie by myself.”
With that, she swept from the room, leaving the door open and her son standing amid the wreckage of his morning, scratching his head.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 17 OLD</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Torrie settled down at the side of the Traveller’s Path as the night deepened around them. The glowing Eden Flowers cast a gentle, golden light over the path, creating a serene atmosphere amidst the dense darkness of the Deep Glaive. Eddie sat on the edge of the path, his gaze fixed on the flickering lights of the Eden Flowers. On the other hand, Torrie focused on a more delicate task. She deftly wove Eden Flowers into a crown, her small fingers moving with practised ease.
Eddie glanced at her, a hint of curiosity in his voice. “So, Torrie, how do you feel about seeing Catherine again?”
Torrie looked up from her flower crown, her expression of thoughtful satisfaction. “I’m happy. Not every day you meet someone with so much knowledge and experience. Aunt Catherine has travelled far and studied so much. Being able to learn from her is fascinating.”
“Yeah,” Eddie flashed a faint smile “it’s... good to see her again.”
Torrie’s smile widened slightly but didn’t reach her eyes as much as before. “And what about you? How do you feel about meeting her again?”
Eddie shrugged, his tone neutral. “It’s alright.”
Torrie’s smile faltered, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Eddie’s face. “Just that? Nothing else fascinates you about her return?”
The shift in Torrie’s tone was subtle but unmistakable. The casualness of the conversation began to dissipate, replaced by an undercurrent of tension. Eddie’s smile faded, and he looked away, his expression suddenly distant.
“It’s just... seeing her again is... cool… She’s awesome.” Eddie replied, his voice lacking its earlier warmth. He glanced at Torrie, whose previously bright demeanour had now shifted to something more serious.
Torrie’s eyes searched his face, her gaze intense. “Are you telling me that’s all there is to it? You don’t feel anything else about her returning after all this time?”
Eddie shifted uncomfortably. “It’s not like that. I just... I don’t know. She’s still the same person she was before.”
Torrie’s smile had vanished entirely, replaced by a frown of concern and confusion. “Eddie, I thought you’d be more... interested. You used to look up to her so much. Doesn’t it bother you that she seems different now?”
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the side, avoiding her piercing gaze. “Maybe. I don’t know.”
The air between them grew thicker, with unspoken emotions. Torrie’s frustration and Eddie’s indifference created a palpable tension. Torrie’s fingers paused mid-motion with the flower crown, her face a mask of frustration and hurt.
The Eden Flowers glowed softly. Their light cast long shadows that danced across their faces. The once-comforting glow now seemed to highlight the distance growing between them.
Torrie finally broke the silence, her voice quiet but firm. “If you’re not interested in seeing what’s different, then...” Her voice ceded down
 “why are you even here?”

            <Title>Chapter 4E</Title>
            <Text>The room was quiet, save for the soft rustling of the bed sheets as Catherine shifted in her sleep. She was sprawled across Eddie’s bottom bunk, her bright red coat tucked haphazardly under her, and her head nestled against the pillow as if she belonged there. The hum of the dormitory outside didn’t faze her, despite the oddity of the situation—an Elf, the Master Alchemist, and most importantly, Eddie’s aunt, napping in their cramped dorm room.
Ashley stood in the doorway, staring at Catherine with her arms crossed, blinking in disbelief. “Really?” she said, her voice laced with a mixture of amusement and frustration.
Will, who was leaning against the opposite wall, let out a low whistle. “Did she really just want a free place to sleep?”
“Yeah,” Eddie sighed, sitting on the edge of his bed, rubbing his face. “That is very Catherine of her.”
Ashley looked at him with a smirk. “You didn’t see that coming?”
“I should’ve,” Eddie muttered. “She’s been around long enough to know how to work people... but I guess this is a new level.”
As the two of them exchanged amused glances, the door to their dorm room creaked open, and in stepped Jake and Jane, two of Eddie’s more curious classmates. They froze mid-step when they saw Catherine still snoring away on the bottom bunk.
“HOLY SHIT, is that an elf? A real elf?” Jane exclaimed, eyes wide with disbelief. She tiptoed closer to get a better look, her mouth hanging open. “You sure her ears aren’t just a costume or something?”
Jake, who was standing behind her, elbowed her. “Dude, that’s definitely an elf. You can’t fake pointy ears like that!”
Before Jane could argue further, Henry, another dorm mate, appeared in the doorway, rolling his eyes. “Oh, for the love of the gods, will you two keep it down?” He crossed his arms and looked at Jake and Jane with an exasperated sigh. “You’re embarrassing yourselves. Go bother someone else.”
Jake and Jane turned around sheepishly, glancing back at Catherine one last time. “You’ve gotta admit, this is wild,” Jake muttered as they backed out of the room.
Henry stepped forward, now clearly intent on a more serious matter. “Anyway, Eddie,” he said, nodding toward the trio, “I need to talk to you, Will, and Ashley. Important stuff. Can we have a word?”
Will gave Henry a curious look. “Sure, what’s up?”
Henry glanced at Catherine briefly before rolling his eyes. “Maybe not in front of the elf.”
Eddie looked over at Catherine, still snoozing peacefully, blissfully unaware of the circus she’d caused. He sighed. “No point in waking her up. She’s not going anywhere.”
Ashley chuckled softly. “It’s funny, isn’t it? The most powerful alchemist in the world, and all she wanted was a nap and a free bed.”
“Well,” Eddie began, his lips curling into a half-smile, “I guess that's Catherine for you. Always knows how to get what she wants, even if it’s just... peace and quiet for a change.”
Will shook his head, the humor of the situation finally sinking in. &quot;She’s definitely a piece of work. What kind of Master Alchemist needs a nap in a college dorm?&quot;
Eddie glanced at his bunkmate, who was still deep in her slumber, a soft snore escaping her. &quot;You really want to know?&quot; He grinned. &quot;The kind who just blew all her money on something completely impractical and now needs a place to crash.&quot;
Ashley’s face lit up in sudden realization, and she laughed. “She’s broke, isn’t she?”
“She’s... incredibly resourceful,” Eddie said, throwing a glance at Catherine as if to make sure she wouldn’t suddenly wake up and punch him for revealing her secret. “But yeah, I guess if you ask Catherine what she wants... it’s probably a bed, food, and a place where she can steal some quiet time without being chased by angry royalty or criminals.”
As Henry and the others looked on, Eddie couldn’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. “I swear, I never saw that one coming. But maybe we can be the ones who make sure she gets her sleep. It’s the least we can do for a family member who’s literally saving our lives.”
And as Catherine continued to sleep, the mystery of her request—a mysterious favor—seemed far less menacing. In that moment, Eddie realized something: Catherine’s true price was something as simple and relatable as a little comfort after an untold number of years spent doing everything but resting.
But that, Eddie thought, was just the way she liked it.

-o-

The dorm’s dining room was dimly lit, a few oil lamps flickering as the storm outside continued to rage. Henry leaned casually against the counter in the small kitchen nook, his arms crossed, his face a mix of curiosity and concern. Across from him, Eddie, Will, and Ashley shifted uncomfortably in their seats, their expressions grim. Eddie’s clothes were still damp, the occasional drip hitting the floor beneath him.
“So,” Henry began, his gaze narrowing, “What in the gods’ names is going on? I mean, it’s not every day you see an elf—an elf—crashing in Room 3 like it’s the most normal thing in the world.” His voice carried an edge of disbelief. “I thought they only existed in fairy tales and those old religious books back home. And then there’s Madeleine and Walther. I haven’t seen either of them for months. What’s happened?”
Eddie’s hands gripped the edge of the table, his knuckles white. He opened his mouth to speak but hesitated, his jaw tightening. The words seemed stuck in his throat, and his gaze dropped to the wooden grain of the table.
Sensing Eddie’s discomfort, Ashley stepped in. “Let’s start with the elf,” she said, her tone composed, though the faintest trace of a smirk played on her lips. “Her name’s Catherine. She’s Eddie’s aunt.”
Henry arched an eyebrow, his intrigue deepening. “His… aunt?”
Eddie finally looked up, forcing a weak smile. “Yeah. My mom and Catherine have been close since they were kids. My mom used to call her ‘her sister from another lifetime.’ Catherine’s always been around, visiting from time to time. I guess she liked me, kind of adopted me as her nephew.”
Henry let out a low whistle, shaking his head in amazement. “So you’ve had an elf in your life all this time, and you never thought to mention it? No big deal, huh?”
Will, despite the tension in the room, couldn’t help but crack a smile. “Oh, trust me, it’s just Eddie keeping secrets. Classic him.”
Eddie didn’t respond to the jab, his expression darkening again as the topic shifted back to the present. Henry seemed to notice, his lighthearted demeanor giving way to seriousness. “Okay,” Henry said, stepping closer and leaning his hands on the table. “But Madeleine. Walther. What’s going on with them?”
The question hung in the air, heavy and oppressive. Eddie looked away, his jaw clenching again. The memory of the truck, the rain, and the helplessness he felt as Madeleine disappeared was still too raw.
Ashley placed a steadying hand on Eddie’s shoulder. “He’s not ready to talk about it,” she said softly before turning her attention to Henry. “I’ll fill you in.”
Henry straightened, his attention fully on Ashley.
“As for Madeleine and Walther...” Ashley’s voice trailed off briefly as she glanced at Eddie, who still hadn’t looked up. She took a deep breath, steadying herself before picking up the story. “We were visiting Madeleine. It was supposed to be a normal visit, but... she was taken. Kidnapped. By this group—The Black Hand.”
“The Black Hand?” Henry’s brow furrowed, his lips pressed into a thin line. “And Walther?” he asked.
Ashley hesitated for a moment. “We don’t know. But he’s... involved. Somehow. We’re not sure how deep, but it’s clear he had something to do with Madeleine being taken.”
Henry’s gaze shifted back to Eddie, who finally looked up, his face pale but resolute. “They took her because of me,” Eddie said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. “They want me to come for her.”
Henry’s fists clenched on the table, the veins in his arms tightening as he processed the information. “Damn it. I knew something was off about him lately, but I didn’t think—” He stopped, shaking his head in frustration. “And Madeleine... What’s the plan?”
Eddie looked up, his green eyes burning with determination. “I’m going to get her back.”
The dining room fell into a heavy silence as Henry leaned back against the counter, arms crossed, his expression unreadable. He glanced at Eddie, Will, and Ashley, each of them worn down but resolute in their own ways. For a moment, he seemed lost in thought, his brow furrowing deeply. Then, he spoke, his tone measured.
“You know,” he began, “I’ve been here longer than all of you combined. Four years studying Automaton Engineering, watching how this city works—or, more often, doesn’t. And let me tell you something: the Black Hand isn’t just some gang you can outwit or outfight. They’re a damn institution. Every newspaper, every history book I’ve read about Edenfield, they always come up. They’re a criminal ring older than this city itself. Organized, ruthless, and everywhere.”
The weight of his words pressed down on the room. Eddie clenched his fists, his jaw tight. “I don’t care,” he said quietly but firmly. “If no one else will go after Madeleine, I will. I’ll go with Catherine if it’s just the two of us. No one else has to risk their lives.”
Will and Ashley exchanged a look, their earlier fear still evident in their eyes. But after a moment, Ashley straightened in her chair, her face set with quiet determination. “You’re not the only one who cares about Madeleine, Eddie. If you’re going, I’m going too.”
“Yeah,” Will added, his usual humor absent, replaced by an uncharacteristic seriousness. “You’re not going alone, mate. No way.”
Eddie blinked, their words catching him off guard. For a brief moment, a flicker of gratitude crossed his face, but it was quickly overshadowed by a new worry. “Do you even realize what you’re signing up for? If I get myself killed, that’s one thing. But if something happens to you two...” He trailed off, unable to finish the thought.
Henry, who had been quietly observing, suddenly broke into a small smile. “You’ve got good friends, Eddie. But let me make something clear.” He stepped forward, his presence commanding. “If the three of you are really stupid enough to go after the Black Hand, then the Dorm’s going too. No way I’m letting a bunch of first-years take on a centuries-old assassin ring by themselves.”
Eddie looked up sharply. “Henry, you don’t have to—”
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Henry interrupted, waving a hand dismissively. “But I couldn’t live with myself if I let you all run off into danger without someone who knows what they’re doing. I’ll drive you wherever you need to go. At least let me make sure you don’t die on the way.”
Before Eddie could respond, the sound of footsteps approached the dining room. Jake and Jane, the twin troublemakers of Dorm 7, poked their heads in, their expressions alight with curiosity.
“Oi, what’s all this about?” Jake asked, his curious gaze darting to Eddie, then to Will, and finally settling on Henry. “And what’s this I hear about the elf?”
Jane, leaning against her brother, raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, is she for real? Never seen one outside of books. You sure those ears aren’t fake?”
Henry pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. “Jake, Jane, I swear—”
But the twins weren’t done. “If she’s going,” Jane said, jerking a thumb back toward Room 3, “Then we’re going too.”
Jake nodded enthusiastically. “Can’t let an elf outdo us.”
Eddie groaned, his head falling into his hands. Will chuckled under his breath, while Ashley just rolled her eyes.
Henry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Seriously, you two? What did I say about bothering guests?”
“We didn’t bother her,” Jake protested, grinning. “We just... looked. Quietly.”
“Very quietly,” Jane echoed, her tone mock-innocent.
Henry shot them both a stern glare, though there was a glimmer of amusement in his eyes. “Look, I don’t care if she’s an elf or the fucking mayor. She’s still a guest, and Dorm 7 treats its guests with respect. Got it?”
“But—” Jake started.
“No buts,” Henry interrupted, pointing at the twins. “Show some respect. And keep your gawking to a minimum.”
Jane smirked. “You sound like Dad.”
“Yeah,” Jake added, his grin wide. “All you need now is a pair of reading glasses and—”
Before Jake could finish, Henry took a step toward them, his stern expression melting into playful annoyance. The twins yelped and darted out of the room, their laughter echoing down the hallway.
Henry sighed, shaking his head with a wry smile. “Why did I ever agree to be dorm captain?”
Eddie, despite the tension weighing on him, couldn’t help but crack a small smile. It was a brief reprieve, but one he sorely needed. For a moment, it felt like they were just students again—ordinary kids in an extraordinary world.
“Alright,” Henry said, turning back to them, his tone sobering. “If we’re doing this, we’re doing it right. But no more surprises, yeah?”
Eddie nodded, the determination in his gaze returning. “No more surprises.”
For now, at least, they were in this together. And that made all the difference. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3</Title>
            <Text>As they continued walking through the courtyard. Catherine's expression shifted. A glint of something thoughtful appeared in her eyes. She paused for a moment, looking out at the trees as if she were piecing together a memory. &quot;You know,&quot; she said casually, &quot;I remember when I first arrived in Weshaven. You told me you were off to university—Edenfield, right? Big dreams and all that.&quot; 

Eddie winced, feeling the weight of the lie he'd told her back then. His hands tightened around the ring in his pocket. &quot;I know, I know,&quot; he muttered, frustration creeping into his voice. &quot;I know I shouldn't have lied. I didn't go to any university. I'm not on any sort of scholarship. I'm just a kid expelled from a magic academy and stuck in his father's shop, that's all.&quot; 

Catherine's eyes softened, but there was a firmness in her voice as she spoke. &quot;That's not what I meant, Eddie.&quot; She paused, 

Catherine is stepping closer to him, her tone dropping lower, more serious. &quot;Do you want to pursue that for real?&quot; 

Eddie stopped, his heart skipping a beat. He turned to face her. Expecting some kind of punchline. Catherine always had a way of lightening the mood with a joke, especially when things got too serious. But this time, there was no joke. Her gaze was unwavering, the kind of seriousness he didn't often see from her. 

The silence hung between them, and Eddie was at a loss for words. For a moment, it felt like his entire past, failures, and doubts were standing before him. Laid bare for Catherine to see. He had always been good at deflecting, hiding behind humour or charm, but this was different. She was asking him a question that required more than just an answer—it was a question about his future, his choice to really face what lay ahead. 
Eddie shifted his weight from one foot to the other, a knot forming in his stomach. He opened his mouth, but no words came out. What could he say? That he wanted to be someone more than the disappointment he felt he was? That he could really see himself pursuing magic again after everything?
He let out a long sigh. &quot;I don't know. I haven't exactly given it much thought lately.&quot; He paused, then looked her in the eye.
Catherine stood there, her gaze softer than before. “Hmm, I suppose you’re right.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard. For a moment, he thought he’d misheard her. Catherine… agreeing with him? Not pushing, not nudging, not prodding him with yet another half-hearted motivational speech? His confusion deepened as she turned and began walking again.
“I’m sorry,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but steady. “I suppose these past few weeks I’ve been pushing you too hard. ‘Eddie, why not this, why not that,’” she added with a faint chuckle, shaking her head. “I’ve been so caught up in what I think is best for you that I didn’t stop to think how much it might’ve hurt you.”
Eddie stood rooted to the spot, watching her walk ahead. The words settled over him like a weight—heavy and suffocating. She had finally given up. After all her pushing, nagging, and coaxing, she was done.
And for the first time, the thought of Catherine stopping felt far worse than any of her nagging ever had.
This is it, Eddie thought, his chest tightening. This is how it happens. You stop arguing, you stop trying, and you go back to the apothecary, back to Weshaven, back to—
Back to a mundane life.
She turned and continued walking, her pace unhurried. Eddie trailed behind her, the weight in his chest growing heavier with every step.
“There’s nothing wrong with staying here in Weshaven, I suppose.” Catherine went on, her voice soft, almost wistful. “It’s quaint, beautiful, calm. And being an apothecary here, in the middle of all this… I think there is nothing wrong with it.”
No.
The word struck him like a thunderclap, reverberating through his entire being.
No, There is something wrong with that, in fact, it’s wrong to him.
His feet moved before his mind caught up. He stepped forward, his voice rising before he could second-guess himself.
“That’s what’s wrong for me, Catherine!” Eddie interrupted, his voice breaking as he stopped in his tracks.
She stopped and turned, surprised by the sudden outburst.
“It’s wrong for me to just stay here and pretend this is enough,” he said, his voice trembling. “It’s wrong for me to give up on Alchemy—the one thing I’ve ever been truly passionate about! Do you know what it feels like to love something so much it’s all you think about? I can’t stop seeing the formulas in my head, dreaming about what I could create, what I could become. It’s like a fire inside me, and every day I stay here, it dims just a little more.”
His voice cracked, but he pushed through, the words spilling out as if he’d been holding them back for years.
“I’ve spent so much time lying to everyone—my parents, my friends, you—and pretending I don’t care, but I do. I care so much it hurts. I can’t keep pretending that this… this little life here in Weshaven is what I want. It’s not. It’s never been enough.”
Catherine’s eyes softened, her lips parting as if to speak, but Eddie didn’t let her.
“And you know what’s worst of all?” His voice dropped to a near-whisper. “I’ve been lying to myself. Telling myself I can be happy here, that I can make this work. But I can’t. Because deep down, I know who I am, and I know what I want. I don’t want to be an apothecary. I don’t want to stay in this quiet, deadbeat hamlet, watching the years slip away.”
He looked at her, his expression filled with a mixture of desperation and resolve.
“It’s wrong for me to give up on my dreams, Catherine. It’s wrong for me to not go to Edenfield.”
The courtyard fell silent, save for the faint rustle of leaves in the breeze. Eddie stood there, his chest heaving as if he’d just run a great distance. For the first time in years, he felt the weight on his shoulders lift, replaced by a flicker of hope.
Eddie pressed forward, his steps heavy, his outburst echoing in his own ears. He didn’t look back at Catherine, too embarrassed by the rawness he’d just exposed.
“Sorry for the outburst,” he muttered, trying to sound nonchalant, though his voice wavered. “But I guess it’s all too late now, isn’t it?”
“It is not,” Catherine replied firmly, her voice carrying an undeniable conviction as she quickly caught up to him.
Eddie stopped, turning his head just enough to glance at her. He scoffed bitterly, shoving his hands into his pockets. “The recommendation letter for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship has expired, Catherine,” he said, his tone biting, though the bitterness was clearly aimed at himself. “What should I do? Walk in with an expired recommendation letter from seven years ago and beg for them to take me back?”
Catherine grinned slyly, the corners of her mouth quirking up as she tilted her head. “I don’t know,” she said, her tone playful. “I guess you could make that work.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard by her lightheartedness. “What are you—”
Before he could finish, Catherine reached into the pocket of her medical gown, her movements deliberate yet casual. From it, she withdrew a gleaming brass card, holding it up between two fingers. The metallic surface caught the sunlight, casting a faint shimmer.
Eddie’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the object. He stepped closer, his curiosity overriding his frustration. The brass card bore Catherine’s name etched in elegant script, alongside an intricate alchemical symbol: a circle intertwined with a rectangle and a triangle.
“Tell them I sent you,” Catherine said, her voice steady, almost daring him to argue.
Eddie froze, staring at the card, the weight of her words sinking in. “Catherine… what is this?”
“It’s my recommendation,” she explained, her tone softening. “I may not be the head of the Sage’s Institute, but I’ve got enough credibility in Alchemy circles that they’ll have to think twice before dismissing you. An expired recommendation? That’s nothing. Not when they see this.”
His fingers twitched, and he reached out hesitantly, as if the brass card might vanish if he moved too quickly. When he finally took it, he felt the cool, smooth metal against his palm. It was heavier than he expected, carrying not just its physical weight but also the weight of her belief in him.
“You… you’d really do this for me?” Eddie asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Of course,” Catherine said, her expression softening into something more genuine. “I’ve seen what you can do, Eddie. I know how much Alchemy means to you. And if you want this, if you really want to go to Edenfield, then I’ll stand by you. You’re not alone in this.”
Eddie’s throat tightened, and for a moment, he couldn’t find the words. He looked at the card again, then back at Catherine, who gave him an encouraging nod.
“Thank you,” he said finally,
“Don’t thank me yet,” Catherine replied with a smirk. “You’ve still got a long road ahead.”
Eddie held the brass card tightly, a sense of determination reigniting within him. For the first time in years, the dream that felt so distant now seemed just within reach.

            <Title>Story1</Title>
            <Text>&quot;Grandma?…&quot; the girl's voice was small, a half-whisper. &quot;What if... what if I'm not good at it? What if I’m not good at anything?&quot;
Golden late-afternoon light filtered through the car window. Dust danced in the sunbeams, lazy and slow. The girl sat in the back seat, the leather seat worn smooth under her small hands. Beside her, her grandmother smelled of jasmine tea and cloves.
Outside, endless green rice paddies spread as far as the eyes could see. The rhythmic thumping of the tires on the asphalt a steady heartbeat.
&quot;Every soul chooses its path long before it arrives,&quot; Her grandmother said, her voice a gentle, soothing melody. 
&quot;Some paths are smooth,” She continued, “Some are hidden behind shadows. But none are without purpose. You must not doubt yours. Your destiny is great ahead of you.&quot;
“But…” The girl said, “I’m not as smart as father…” her voice lowers, “And I’m not as beautiful as mom… then how can my destiny be great?”
Her grandmother smiled, “You should worry not about other people, sweetie.” She leaned closer and hold her hands tighter, “Your destiny is only yours to take. Not anyone else.”
The girl leaned into her grandmother’s embrace, the familiar scent of jasmine enveloping her. It felt like the safest place in the universe. 
She rested her head on that soft, strong shoulder, the gentle rocking of the car and the steady thump-thump of the tires lulling her into a deep comfort. She closed her eyes, letting sleep take her.
Thump-thump...
The sound began to change.
Thump... hisss...
The rhythm of the tires slowed down. It became a deep, low, resonant frequency. The smell of jasmine and cloves evaporated.
Hiss... clunk...
A coldness seeped into her, a profound, unnatural chill. Where was the warmth I felt earlier? The girl might thought, she felt encased by something smooth, hard, and metallic.
Her eyes snapped open.
There was only white.
A curved, frosted glass panel sat an inch from her face, clouded with a thin layer of ice.
Dim, blue-white light filtered through it. She was on her back, confined, her arms pinned to her sides. A faint, rhythmic beeping echoed in the tight space, synchronized with a slow, pulsing light somewhere beyond her feet. 
She was in a box. A coffin of ice and light.
And she was utterly, terrifyingly alone.
A hiss of depressurizing gas, the frosted glass panel hissed upwards, retracting into the ceiling of the pod with a decisive clunk. 
The sterile, blue-white light of the interior was replaced by a dim, dusty gray, thick with the silence of a tomb. Momentarily, she just lay there, blinking, her breath still misting in the frigid air escaping the pod.
Slowly, stiffly, she sat upright. A cascade of brittle, yellowed wires and suction cups peeled away from her skin, falling onto the padded interior with dry, rustling sounds. She looked around.
She was in a large room. Wires snaked across the floor like dead vines, and overturned tables were strewn with shattered glassware and dark, silent computer monitors. 
It was a laboratory long abandoned.
A place where something had ended a long long time ago.
&quot;Where… am I?&quot; she whispered, her voice raspy, unused.
A strange sensation, a feeling of being blanketed in something heavy and cool. 
She swung her legs over the side of the pod to stand, expecting the familiar touch of hospital gown cotton against her skin.
Instead her legs felt… wrong.
Her legs were not her own. They were crafted from a smooth, milky-white material that looked like porcelain but felt like steel, gleaming faintly in the dim light. 
Intricate golden lines, like circuitry or filigree, traced their way down the impossibly perfect contours of her shins and thighs.
She stepped out of the pod. Her bare feet met the cold, tiled floor with a sharp, resonant clink. The sound echoed in the dead quiet of the lab.
Her heart ran faster, hot and suffocating. This was a suit. It had to be. She thought, Some kind of strange, tight-fitting suit. She brought her hands up to her chest to find a seam, a zipper, anything—and stopped dead.
Her hands, her arms, her torso—they were all the same. White, lustrous porcelain-metal, etched with gold. She saw the delicate, mechanical articulation of her own knuckles, the subtle whir of a tiny servo in her wrist as she turned her hand over.
&quot;No,&quot; she breathed, her voice trembling.
It wasn't a suit.
Frantically, she began to scrub at her own arm, her “fingernails” scraping uselessly against the unyielding, foreign surface. &quot;Get it off,&quot; she whimpered, the words catching in her throat. &quot;Get it off me!&quot;
She clawed at her shoulders, her stomach, her legs, a rising tide of desperation making her movements clumsy and violent. The material didn't give. It didn't even scratch. 
It was her. 
The cold, hard material moving under her frantic touch was connected to her thoughts, her intentions. It was her body.
A strangled sob escaped her lips and her legs gave out. She fell, hard.
CLANG!
The noise of her metallic knees hitting the tiled floor was deafening, a sickening percussion of metal on stone that shot up her new spine. The sound was so profoundly wrong, so inhuman, that it shattered the last of her composure.
She hugs this strange, cold body that wasn't hers. Tears streamed down her face, hot against her human face, dripping onto the impassive white metal of her own chest. The sobs wracked her, A series of shuddering mechanical jolts that shook her entire frame.
&quot;What...&quot; she choked out, her voice breaking. &quot;What happened to me?&quot;
It was then she saw it. On the polished, reflective metal of the floor plating, darkened by grime but still able to cast a warped image, was a reflection. 
A girl with her face—a tear-streaked, terrified face—stared back. But it was a stranger's face. 
The eyes were hers, maybe, but the set of her jaw, the shape of her cheeks, they were unfamiliar. It was like looking at a photograph of someone she was supposed to know but didn't.
Her crying subsided into a hollow, empty silence. She stared at the stranger on the floor, a porcelain doll with her eyes.
&quot;Who… am I?&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 12E V2</Title>
            <Text>The sterile white corridor became a place of silent miracles. From the shimmering, heat-haze curtain of Ashley’s Mirror Veil, ghosts began to emerge. A gaunt, elderly Bapak with haunted eyes stepped out of what looked like thin air, his gaze wide with disbelief. Then a young woman, clutching the arm of her brother, both stumbling on weak legs. Will, a tense shadow by the main lab entrance, would watch the corridor, his face a mask of concentration, before giving a quick, low wave of his hand—Go, now. The freed captives would then move, a silent, ghost-like procession, down the hall leading back to the cacophonous menagerie, their escape masked by the screeching of the captive creatures. Will was the conductor of this impossible orchestra, and Ashley, standing firm with her staff planted, was the magic holding the stage together.
The perspective shifts back to Eddie, who is now on the last three captives, his hope surging.
Inside the holding pen, a powerful, hopeful rhythm had taken hold. The oppressive stench of fear was still there, but now it was mingled with the electric, ozone scent of imminent freedom. Eddie moved to the next cage, his exhaustion forgotten, replaced by a surging, brilliant hope that warmed him from the inside out. We're doing it, he thought, a sense of profound awe washing over him. We're actually doing it.
He no longer needed to look at Madeleine. They were a single unit, moving with an unspoken understanding. As he placed his hand on the next lock, he could hear her soft, steady whisper to the person in the final cage, her voice a balm of reassurance.
The green light of his alchemy felt less like a weapon now and more like a key. Hiss. The lock dissolved into fine grey dust. The cage door creaked open. Madeleine was there instantly, helping a young man to his feet.
&quot;You're okay,&quot; she murmured, giving his arm a firm, steadying squeeze. &quot;Go to my friend at the end of the hall. He'll show you the way. Be quiet, and don't look back.&quot;
The young man looked from Madeleine's tired but fiercely compassionate face to Eddie's, his own eyes filling with tears of disbelief and gratitude. He nodded and shuffled out into the shimmering veil.
Two left.
The holding pen, once a gallery of despair, was now a hall of echoing emptiness. The vast space felt liberating. Eddie allowed himself a small, genuine smile, catching Madeleine's eye as he turned. She returned it, a fleeting, exhausted, but triumphant expression that spoke volumes. They were winning.
He moved to the second-to-last cage. The woman inside was already on her feet, her hands pressed together as if in prayer. The alchemy flowed from him effortlessly now, energized by their success. The final lock dissolved.
One more.
Victory was a breath away. He turned to the last cage, the sense of triumph so close, so tangible, he could almost taste it. One more person to free, and they would have pulled off the impossible.
&quot;Hey! What's the meaning of this!&quot;
The voice was a thunderclap in the sterile quiet. It echoed from the main laboratory corridor, sharp and authoritative. Eddie's smile vanished, his blood running cold. Hope shattered into a million pieces.
He spun around. Professor Gareth Hudson stood at the far end of the room, his face a mask of thunderous disbelief. His polished staff was held tight in one hand, its tip glowing with a faint, dangerous light. Beside him, his two fatigue-jacketed companions snapped into formation, raising military-grade magical staves and aiming them down the hall. Will and Ashley were nowhere to be seen, likely having ducked for cover the moment Hudson appeared.
Without a second thought, Eddie stepped in front of Madeleine, shielding her. &quot;Back off!&quot; he yelled, his voice raw with defiance. He threw his hand forward, and a complex, brilliant green transmutation circle flared to life in the air between them, aimed directly at his professor.
Hudson's companions reacted instantly, their staves shifting to aim squarely at Eddie's chest.
But Hudson himself just stared, his expression looking more confused than angry. &quot;Welton? What in God's name are you doing here? Are you completely mad?&quot;
&quot;I know what you're doing!&quot; Eddie shot back, his voice ringing with righteous fury. &quot;This illegal Chimaera breeding! This whole sick experiment! It ends tonight!&quot;
The accusation struck Hudson like a physical blow. His confusion instantly hardened into a rare, palpable anger. &quot;Chimaeras?&quot; he snarled, taking a threatening step forward. &quot;Do you have any idea of the danger you are in? Of what you have stumbled into? You could have been killed!&quot;
Eddie let out a bitter, incredulous laugh. &quot;Oh, suddenly you care if someone dies? After all the people you've experimented on? After everything you've done to Madeleine?&quot; He gestured wildly at the room around them. &quot;How many have you killed for your precious research?!&quot;
He gathered his energy, the transmutation circle spinning faster, brighter, ready to unleash a wave of corrosive force. But before he could, a hand grabbed his arm. It was Madeleine. Her grip was weak, but astonishingly firm.
&quot;Eddie, stop!&quot;
&quot;Maddie, get back!&quot; he yelled, trying to shake her off, his eyes never leaving Hudson. &quot;I can handle him!&quot;
&quot;No! Eddie, listen to me!&quot; she insisted, pulling on his arm with all her strength. She stumbled in front of him, breaking his line of sight. She put her hands on his chest, forcing him to look down at her, the person he had just risked everything to save. Her eyes were wide, not with fear of Hudson, but with a desperate, pleading urgency. &quot;Please, you have to listen. You've got it wrong.&quot;
&quot;What are you talking about? He's right there!&quot; Eddie fought back, his rage blinding him.
&quot;It wasn't Professor Hudson,&quot; Madeleine said, her voice quiet, but it cut through his fury like a blade of ice. The words hung in the sterile air, heavy and absolute.
The words slammed into Eddie with the force of a physical blow. The brilliant green transmutation circle flickered, sputtered, and died. His arm lowered, feeling impossibly heavy. The entire foundation of his righteous fury, the certainty that had fueled him through the alleys of Hallowmere, crumbled into dust. He stared at Professor Hudson, whose face was no longer just angry, but etched with a deep, familiar weariness—the same grief Eddie had seen the night he'd spoken of his lost daughter. He didn't understand the full story, not even close. But he saw the truth in Madeleine's eyes. And that was enough.
The standoff dissipated, leaving a vacuum of tense, unanswered questions. Hudson’s companions cautiously lowered their staves, their eyes still locked on Eddie.
It was just a moment—a fragile, breathless pause in the heart of the enemy's lair.
The green light of Eddie's transmutation circle sputtered. He stared, utterly lost, from Madeleine's earnest, pleading face to Professor Hudson's. He didn't trust Hudson, not for a second, but his faith in Madeleine was absolute. With a shuddering breath, he let his hand fall to his side, the alchemical light winking out of existence. The standoff, born of his own furious conviction, dissipated into a tense, unspoken truce.
The quiet lasted only a moment.
One of Hudson's companions, a man with a sharp, hawkish face, suddenly swiveled, aiming his staff down a dark, previously unnoticed service corridor to their right.
&quot;Audible, right!&quot; he barked, the phrase sharp and professional.
Instantly, Hudson and his other man snapped their staves in the same direction, their postures shifting from wary to combat-ready. The tension slammed back into the room, but this time, they were all facing the same unseen threat.
Hudson aimed his own polished silver staff into the oppressive darkness of the hallway. &quot;Who goes there?&quot; he commanded, his voice booming with military authority. No answer came back but the faint, unnerving echo of his own words.
The three men stood ready, a silent, disciplined unit preparing for an attack. Hudson turned his head slightly, his eyes locking onto Eddie.
&quot;Welton. Get your friends and get out of here. Now,&quot; he ordered, his voice low and deadly serious. &quot;Let the adults handle this.&quot;
Eddie shook his head, stepping protectively in front of the holding pen door. &quot;We can't. There's one more captive in there. We're not leaving her.&quot;
&quot;Don't be a fool!&quot; Hudson snarled, his focus split between the dark corridor and the stubborn student. &quot;This isn't a classroom exercise! That is an order!&quot;
&quot;I'm not leaving anyone behind!&quot; Eddie shot back. He turned, ready to go back for the final captive.
Before he could take a step, a hand like an iron clamp seized his arm. It was Hudson. &quot;It is not time to play games, Welton!&quot; he growled, his face inches from Eddie's. &quot;This is dangerous territory!&quot;
It was then that a streak of sickly purple light erupted from the dark hallway.
Hudson instinctively let go, shoving Eddie aside as he raised his own staff to fire back a bolt of brilliant, concussive energy. &quot;Reid, cover!&quot; he roared, and the lab exploded into a cacophony of magical blasts and shattering tiles.
The firefight was the only opening Eddie needed. He scrambled back, grabbing Madeleine's hand. &quot;Come on!&quot;
He pulled her towards the relative safety of the holding pen doorway, but the retreat was a gauntlet. A sickly purple curse sizzled past Madeleine's head, striking the wall and making the damp brick hiss. A moment later, a concussive blast from one of Hudson's men shattered the doorframe, sending splinters and plaster flying. Eddie tackled Madeleine, pulling her down as a fireball erupted where they had just been standing.
They scrambled through the doorway and back into the dim, foul-smelling room. The battle raged behind them, a chaotic symphony of explosions and shouted commands.
They rushed to the last cage, located right next to the door. It was part of Will's contingency plan, meticulously thought out in the seconds they had: 'the last ones closest to the exit, in case time runs out.'
The last captive, a boy no older than fifteen, was curled in the back of the cage, shaking uncontrollably. As Madeleine fumbled with the simple metal latch, the boy didn't move. He looked past her, his eyes wide with a terror that had nothing to do with the firefight outside.
&quot;No! No, please!&quot; he cried, pointing with a trembling finger deeper into the holding pen. &quot;He's back there! In the dark!&quot;
&quot;It's alright, we're here to help you,&quot; Madeleine said soothingly, trying to coax him out. But the boy just shook his head frantically, pressing himself further into the corner. &quot;Don't make me go that way! He's there!&quot;
The boy's genuine panic made Eddie's blood run cold. He turned, his eyes piercing the gloom at the far end of the long, narrow room. It looked empty, just shadows and rows of vacant cages.
A brilliant streak of thunder ripped through the darkness, cracking the air with a deafening roar. Eddie instinctively shoved Madeleine and the boy's cage aside as the lightning bolt struck the floor where he'd been standing, leaving a starburst of blackened, smoking tile. Another followed instantly.
Dodging back, Eddie slammed his palm against the bars of an empty iron cage beside him. A transmutation circle flared, not with the green of corrosion, but with the bright, sharp light of formation. 
The iron bars groaned, twisted, and fused together under his command. In seconds, they had warped into the form of a massive, metallic serpent. With a final push of will, Eddie sent it lunging down the dark corridor, an alchemical attack dog seeking its prey.
There was a choked cry of surprise from the shadows, the clatter of a staff hitting the concrete floor, and the heavy, grinding crash of the iron serpent slamming into its target. The figure was thrown from the darkness into a patch of dim light, their hood falling back from the force of the impact.
Eddie's breath caught in his throat. His fury, his fear, everything froze into a single, horrifying point of clarity.
It was Walther Schroder.
His calm, academic face was twisted into a mask of pure fury, a trickle of blood running from his temple where the serpent had struck him. They stared at each other for a long, silent moment, the chaos of the battle outside fading into a distant hum. The friend who had helped him study. The ally who had seen the sketch. The traitor.
A cold, dangerous calm settled over Eddie. He didn't take his eyes off Walther.
&quot;Madeleine,&quot; he said, his voice flat and hard as steel. &quot;Take the boy. Get to Will and Ashley.&quot;
&quot;Eddie-&quot; Madeleine started to object, her eyes darting between him and Walther.
&quot;Go! I got this!&quot; he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument.
She saw the look on his face, the promise of a fight that was now deeply, irrevocably personal. There was no time. Nodding once, her face a mask of terror and trust, she wrenched open the cage door and pulled the last captive out, half-carrying him toward the chaotic light of the main lab.
The door swung shut, leaving Eddie and Walther alone in the grim gallery of empty cages.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 13E</Title>
            <Text>The perpetual twilight of Archaea's Undercity cast an eerie glow on the cobblestone streets, the swirling fog mingling with the gaslight's sickly luminescence. Huddled in a shadowy alcove, Eddie and his companions resembled a group of cornered animals, their faces illuminated by flickering shadows and etched with worry. Eddie tightened the straps of his bandolier, his mind a whirlwind of battle plans and desperate contingencies.
Will, his ever-optimistic roommate from Bard's College, strummed his guitar absentmindedly, the soft melody battling with the distant murmur of the Undercity. An amplifier strapped to his back hummed to life, its presence a jarring juxtaposition to their clandestine mission. Christine, the snobbish conjuration student hailing from a line of distinguished mages, stood aloof, her disdainful expression masking a steely determination. Geralt, her stoic companion, scanned their surroundings with a practiced eye, his hand hovering near his weapon, ever vigilant.
Across from them, Henry, the taciturn upperclassman from the Automaton Engineering Faculty, tinkered with a small, whirring device. His face, usually an unreadable mask, held a hint of nervous energy as he meticulously adjusted wires and dials. The silence, thick with tension, was broken only by the faint hum of Will's amplifier and the occasional sigh escaping from Christine's tightly pursed lips. They waited, a ragtag team united by a common purpose, for the return of their scouts – Jake and Jane, the street-smart twins from Bard's College.
Christine's voice, laced with thinly veiled panic, shattered the fragile calm. &quot;Where are they?&quot; she hissed, her words echoing in the damp confines of the alcove. &quot;We're sitting ducks here!&quot;
Will, ever the mediator, shot back a sharp reply. &quot;They'll be back, Christine,&quot; he snapped, his voice laced with a frustration that mirrored their collective unease. &quot;Just be patient!&quot;
A collective sigh of relief rippled through the group as the twins materialized from the swirling fog. Their identical grins, a stark contrast to the somber mood moments ago, were a beacon of hope in the oppressive twilight.
&quot;We found it!&quot; Jane declared, her short hair mussed but her eyes sparkling with excitement. &quot;The Black Hand's Fortress is hidden beneath the old cathedral, just like the rumors said.&quot;
Jake took over, his voice serious. &quot;They use a network of enchanted crystal holograms for communication. If we can disrupt them, it'll cause chaos inside. Henry, think you can handle that?&quot;
A rare spark of enthusiasm ignited in Henry's eyes. &quot;No problem,&quot; he replied, his voice firm. &quot;I just need to get close enough to plant these disruptors.&quot; He gestured towards the device he'd been tinkering with – a complex brass contraption shimmering with intricate gears and crystals.
Eddie's mind raced, a strategic plan taking shape. &quot;Alright, listen up,&quot; he announced, his voice cutting through the tension. &quot;Henry, you'll take care of the disruptors. Christine and Geralt, use your conjurations to provide cover fire. Will and I will use the confusion to infiltrate the fortress and locate our friends. Jake and Jane, you'll be our guides through the tunnels.&quot;
Christine, though still sporting a disdainful sniff, offered a curt nod. &quot;Fine,&quot; she conceded. &quot;But if this all goes south, Welton, the blame falls squarely on your shoulders.&quot;
Eddie, unfazed by her jab, kept his focus on the mission. &quot;Everyone ready?&quot; he asked, his gaze sweeping across the group.
A chorus of determined affirmations echoed in the cavernous alcove. With a deep breath, Eddie took the lead, venturing back into the fog-laden streets of the Undercity. The shadows seemed to press closer now, a tangible manifestation of the dangers that lurked ahead. But the students, their anxieties momentarily quelled by a shared purpose, moved with newfound resolve. The fate of their friends, and perhaps the future of Archaea itself, rested on their shoulders. They were a ragtag team, brought together by circumstance, but tonight, they would fight as one.
As they neared the imposing silhouette of the old cathedral, a cold dread settled in Eddie's gut. The gothic spires pierced the murky sky, their jagged points like accusing fingers. Long, inky shadows stretched across the cobblestones, mimicking the bars of a prison. The air crackled with a tension that made Eddie's hair stand on end. Faint whispers of chanting, carried on a damp breeze, sent shivers down his spine.
Jake and Jane, their usual bravado tempered by the oppressive atmosphere, led the group through a labyrinthine alley. The narrow passage twisted and turned like a serpent's coil, seemingly designed to disorient and mislead. Yet, the twins navigated it with practiced ease, their familiarity with the Undercity a beacon in the suffocating darkness. Finally, they reached a hidden entrance – a small, unassuming door tucked away behind a crumbling statue of a long-forgotten elven sage.
Henry, ever the tinkerer, stepped forward. His hands, surprisingly steady despite the weight of the mission, carefully affixed the disruptors to the shimmering crystals embedded in the walls. A faint hum resonated through the air as the devices whirred to life, their intricate mechanisms pulsing faintly in rhythm with the distant chanting.
&quot;There,&quot; Henry whispered, a hint of satisfaction in his voice as he stepped back. &quot;Give it a moment for the magic to disrupt their communication network.&quot;
The oppressive darkness of the Black Hand's Fortress was pierced only by the flickering glow of strategically placed torches, their orange flames casting grotesque shadows that danced on the rough stone walls. The distant clamor – a cacophony of shouts, confusion, and the telltale clang of metal on metal – was a testament to Henry's successful sabotage of the communication network. Eddie and Will crouched low against the cold, damp stone, their breaths misting in the frigid air. Anticipation coiled tight in Eddie's gut, a cold serpent squeezing ever tighter. They were waiting for the signal, the green light that Christine and Geralt would cast to signify their success in creating a magical diversion.
Across the corridor, Christine stood tall and proud, her silhouette stark against the flickering torches. Her usual disdainful expression was replaced by a fierce concentration, her eyes blazing with arcane energy. In her hands, her staff, a conduit for her magic, pulsed with a soft inner light. Geralt, ever the silent warrior, stood beside her, mirroring her movements with a practiced precision. His stoic demeanor, however, could not entirely mask the power that crackled around him.
&quot;Ready, Geralt?&quot; Christine murmured, her voice barely a whisper over the low hum of their combined magic.
Geralt inclined his head ever so slightly, his gaze fixed intently on the space before them. &quot;Whenever you are,&quot; he replied in a voice as steady as stone.
Christine took a deep breath, and with a flick of her wrist, began to weave a complex spell. Her hands moved in a mesmerizing dance, her fingers tracing intricate patterns in the air. A soft, ethereal glow emanated from her staff, expanding outwards and shimmering like a delicate veil of light. Geralt echoed her movements, his own magic adding layers of complexity and raw power to the burgeoning illusion.
Eddie watched, mesmerized, as the veil of light grew, its luminescence cascading over them like a silken curtain. The air shimmered and distorted, the harsh lines of reality blurring into a dreamlike haze. Christine and Geralt's combined conjuration was a masterpiece of illusion, bending light and shadow to their will.
&quot;Now,&quot; Christine said softly, her voice strained but resolute. &quot;Move quickly and stay close to the veil. It will mask your presence, but it won't make you invisible. Think of yourselves as… chameleons blending into the background. As long as no one gets a good look at you, you'll be alright. But be warned, any sudden movements or breaks in concentration on our part could shatter the illusion.&quot;
Eddie nodded curtly, his heart hammering a frantic tattoo against his ribs. He stole a glance at Will, who now bore an uncanny resemblance to one of the Black Hand cultists, complete with their dark robes and shadowed face. Will flashed him a quick, reassuring grin before stepping forward, his form seamlessly melding into the shimmering veil. The world around Eddie blurred and shifted, the solid walls of the corridor dissolving into a swirling mist. With a deep breath and a silent prayer, Eddie followed suit, his own form morphing and twisting until he too became indistinguishable from the phantoms that surrounded him. They were cloaked in borrowed shadows, phantoms flitting through a hostile world, their only hope resting on the fragile magic that separated them from detection and potential disaster.
Eddie straightened, a flicker of hope warming his chest. &quot;Alright, Will, that's our cue. Let's move. Stay close and be ready for anything.&quot;
With a silent nod, Will fell into step beside him. As they slipped through the doorway and into the bowels of the fortress, the frigid air tightened its grip, and the shadows seemed to solidify, clinging to the uneven stone walls like malevolent spirits. The flickering torchlight cast grotesque shapes that danced on the rough-hewn surfaces, adding to the oppressive atmosphere. Eddie's heart hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs, but he forced himself to breathe deeply, to quiet the storm of emotions churning within him. The fate of their friends, and perhaps the future of Archaea itself, rested on their shoulders. There was no room for panic, only focus and unwavering determination.
They crept forward, their movements as silent as wraiths. The rhythmic thumps of their boots against the cold stone floor were the only sounds that dared to pierce the tense silence. In the distance, a cacophony of shouts, panicked yells, and the clang of metal echoed through the corridors, a symphony of chaos orchestrated by Henry's disruptors. A grim satisfaction tugged at the corner of Eddie's lips. They had the element of surprise, a precious advantage they couldn't afford to squander.
Eddie and Will navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the Black Hand's Fortress with a cautious grace. The shimmering veil of illusion, a testament to Christine and Geralt's magic, draped over them like borrowed cloaks. It rendered them spectral likenesses of the Black Hand cultists, allowing them to blend into the throng of robed figures that patrolled the halls. Yet, their movements remained measured, every step a silent question mark. A misplaced hand, a flicker of doubt in their posture – any anomaly could shatter the illusion and expose them as imposters.
The fortress was a suffocating labyrinth, its dimly lit passages twisting and turning like the innards of a monstrous beast. The air hung heavy with the cloying scent of incense, punctuated by the distant, rhythmic echo of chanted prayers. Flickering torches cast grotesque shadows that danced on the damp stone walls, adding to the unsettling ambiance. Eddie, his heart a frantic drum solo in his chest, led the way. His gaze darted nervously from one shadowed alcove to the next, searching for any sign of their captive friends or the telltale bars of a prison cell.
&quot;Stay close,&quot; he murmured to Will, his voice barely a whisper swallowed by the oppressive silence. &quot;We need to find the jail before they...&quot; His voice trailed off, the unspoken fear hanging heavy in the stale air.
Will, his usual carefree demeanor replaced by a steely resolve, offered a curt nod. Gone was the wisecracking bard; in his place stood a determined companion, his eyes reflecting the flickering torchlight with an unwavering focus. They crept along the uneven stone floor, each step a carefully calculated whisper against the cold stone. The illusion offered a fragile cloak of anonymity, but they couldn't afford complacency. Any sudden movement, any deviation from the practiced movements of a true cultist, could draw unwanted attention and shatter the carefully constructed facade. Their mission’s success, and perhaps the safety of their friends, hinged on their ability to remain unseen, unheard, and unsuspected.
Their hearts hammered a frantic tattoo against their ribs as Eddie and Will rounded a blind corner, nearly colliding with a group of cloaked figures. Adrenaline surged through Eddie, the tip of his tongue going dry. But he remembered Christine's words, forcing himself to remain calm, to trust in the shimmering veil of illusion that separated them from detection.
Thankfully, the cultists barely gave them a second glance. Their eyes, glazed with fanatic zeal, seemed focused on some unseen purpose, their minds consumed by the dark rituals they were about to perform. Eddie and Will, their movements mirroring those of the passing figures, melted into the throng, a pair of imposters mimicking the cadence and posture of true believers. The tension was a palpable entity, clinging to them like a shroud as they navigated the sea of black robes, each shared breath a silent prayer for anonymity.
Finally, a side passage offered a narrow window of opportunity. With a silent nod, Eddie and Will peeled away from the group, slipping into the inky darkness of the offshoot corridor like phantoms disappearing into thin air.
&quot;That was a close call,&quot; Eddie murmured, wiping a sheen of sweat from his brow despite the pervasive chill. The encounter had left him shaken, a stark reminder of the dangers that lurked around every corner in this oppressive fortress.
Will, his face etched with a mixture of relief and nervous energy, spoke up, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;I have an idea, Eddie. It's risky, but it might be the best shot we have at finding our friends.&quot;
Eddie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. The plan they had formulated beforehand seemed risky enough, but he was intrigued by what Will had in mind. &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; he asked, his voice laced with a hint of apprehension.
Will took a deep breath, his eyes gleaming with a newfound determination. &quot;I'm going to talk to one of them,&quot; he said, gesturing towards the direction of the receding cultists. &quot;Maybe I can glean some information about where they're keeping the captives.&quot;
Eddie's eyes widened in alarm. Engaging with the enemy directly went against every instinct screaming for caution. Yet, the urgency of their mission, the fear for their friends trapped somewhere within these cold stone walls, gnawed at him. He knew time wasn't on their side.
After a moment of deliberation, Eddie sighed, a reluctant acceptance settling on his features. &quot;Alright, Will,&quot; he conceded, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Just be careful. Don't do anything reckless.&quot;
Will offered a curt nod, his jaw set with grim determination. Adjusting the folds of his borrowed robes to better resemble a true cultist, he approached a lone figure heading in their direction. The cultist, a gaunt man with hollow eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of a thousand shadowed prayers, looked up with suspicion as Will drew near.
&quot;Brother,&quot; Will greeted him, his voice forced into a tone of camaraderie. &quot;I've been away on a mission and just returned. Can you tell me what's happening tonight?&quot;
The cultist scrutinized Will for a long moment, his face an unreadable mask. But perhaps the illusion, or perhaps the practiced sincerity in Will's voice, seemed to dispel his initial suspicion.
&quot;We have a sacrifice at midnight,&quot; the cultist finally spoke, his voice a low, guttural rasp. &quot;The blood of the innocent will ensure the success of our assassins,&quot; he continued, a hint of reverence coloring his tone. &quot;Lord Raven himself will lead the ceremony.&quot;
Will forced a smile, the gesture strained and unnatural. Despite the churning unease in his stomach, he pressed on. &quot;I-I've heard of Lord Raven's prowess,&quot; he stammered. &quot;Truly, we are blessed. But I need to know where the sacrifices are being held. I have... business with them before the ritual.&quot;
The cultist's gaze narrowed once more, suspicion flickering like a malevolent flame in his shadowed eyes. Eddie, his own breath catching in his throat, tensed, his hand instinctively gripping the hilt of the dagger strapped to his thigh. He was ready to intervene at a moment's notice, the fragile façade of their illusion hanging in the balance.
After what felt like an eternity, the cultist grunted, a single, curt acknowledgement. He gestured vaguely down the corridor. &quot;Take the left passage at the next fork,&quot; he rasped. &quot;You'll find a stairway leading down to the lower cells. That's where they keep the sacrifices.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, brother,&quot; Will said, offering a respectful bow. Relief washed over him, a temporary reprieve from the suffocating tension. He turned and rejoined Eddie, who released a shaky breath he hadn't realized he was holding.
&quot;Let's go,&quot; Will whispered, his voice urgent. With a newfound sense of purpose, they followed the cultist’s directions. The corridor seemed to stretch on forever, every shadow a potential threat.
The flickering torchlight cast long, grotesque shadows as Eddie and Will reached the fork in the passage. A heavy silence hung in the air, broken only by the soft echo of their own footsteps. With a shared glance, they turned left, the darkness of the passage ahead seeming to swallow them whole.
The stairway materialized before them, a black maw leading down into the unknown. A cold tendril of dread snaked down Eddie's spine as they descended, the air growing colder with each step. The damp smell of mildew and despair clung to the stale air, a suffocating weight pressing down on them.
At the bottom, they emerged into a narrow, dimly lit hallway. The oppressive silence was shattered by the faint, muffled cries of pain and the clank of chains scraping against cold, hard stone. A shiver ran down Eddie's spine, a primal fear clawing at the edges of his composure. This was it – the heart of the Black Hand's cruelty.
&quot;This must be it,&quot; Eddie whispered, his voice barely audible over the hammering of his heart. &quot;We need to find Ashley and Dominic, and fast.&quot;
With a newfound urgency, they began their search, moving cautiously down the hallway. Heavy wooden doors lined either side, each one a potential cage holding their friends captive. Through the small, barred windows, they glimpsed huddled figures, some slumped against the wall, defeated, others clinging to a shred of defiance. The sight fueled a fire of anger and determination in Eddie's gut. They wouldn't leave anyone behind.
Suddenly, Will's hand shot out, gripping Eddie's arm and halting their progress. &quot;Over here,&quot; he whispered urgently, his voice barely a rasp. His gaze darted towards a door at the far end of the hall. Relief washed over Eddie as he followed Will's line of sight. Through the grime-coated window, he saw two faces etched into his memory – Ashley, her fiery spirit undimmed even in captivity, and Dominic, his bravado masking a flicker of fear in his eyes.
&quot;There they are,&quot; Eddie murmured, his voice thick with emotion. He wasted no time, rushing towards the door. With trembling hands, he fumbled with the lock, the metallic clicks echoing deafeningly in the silent hallway. Finally, the lock yielded with a satisfying snap.
Eddie threw the door open, revealing Ashley and Dominic huddled together in the cramped cell. Ashley looked up, her eyes blazing with a fierce defiance that sent a jolt through Eddie.
&quot;About time you showed up,&quot; she said, her voice surprisingly strong considering the ordeal they had endured. A ghost of a smile played on her lips, a spark of hope igniting in her gaze. &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;
Eddie's heart hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs, a drumbeat echoing the pounding of his adrenaline. He watched, his breath catching in his throat, as the freed captives slipped one by one through the shimmering veil of illusion. Their forms dissolved into the surrounding shadows, becoming phantoms cloaked in borrowed darkness. Every successful escape sent a tremor of relief through him, a fragile counterpoint to the ever-present tension. But with each freed prisoner, the weight of responsibility grew heavier. One wrong move, one flicker of doubt, and their meticulously crafted plan could unravel, plunging them all back into the darkness.
&quot;Go,&quot; he rasped to the next captive, a young woman whose eyes mirrored the terror that had undoubtedly gripped them all. Her hands shook like leaves in a storm as she tentatively reached out, her fingers brushing against the swirling mist. &quot;Stay close to the wall,&quot; he urged, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;Will's waiting for you near the exit. Just keep moving, and don't look back.&quot;
The young woman offered a shaky nod, her lips pressed into a thin line. Then, with a deep breath that seemed to carry the weight of her captivity, she stepped forward, her form dissolving into the shimmering veil. Eddie watched her disappear, a silent prayer forming on his lips. Each successful escape chipped away at the Black Hand's hold, a testament to their courage and the power of Christine and Geralt's magic.
Yet, the celebration was short-lived. Beside him, Ashley stood resolute, her posture unwavering despite the ordeal she had clearly endured. Her fiery spirit, though strained, still burned bright, a stark contrast to the despair that clung to the other captives.
&quot;Ashley,&quot; Eddie began, his voice laced with concern. &quot;You need to get out of here. This is no place for you. We'll handle the rest, get everyone else free, and then come back for you.&quot;
Ashley met his gaze, her eyes filled with a steely determination that mirrored his own. &quot;No way, Eddie,&quot; she countered, her voice surprisingly strong. &quot;We're in this together. I'm not leaving anyone behind, not until the last person is free.&quot;
Eddie knew he wouldn't win this argument. Ashley's stubborn streak was as legendary as her bravery, and right now, both were on full display. He swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat, a grudging respect welling up within him. With a silent nod, he accepted her decision. Together, they stood shoulder-to-shoulder, a united front against the darkness, as the next captive, a man with fear etched on his face, approached the shimmering gateway to freedom.

            <Title>Chapter 3.5E</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Madeleine walked deeper into the Sanctuary, the mood began to shift. Near the front, sunlight still touched the fences and grassy paths, where Sanctuary members were leading tours for wide-eyed elementary-aged students in matching cloaks. A small group clustered near a gentle, antlered beast with scales like polished stone, giggling as it bowed to let them pet its snout.
Farther along, two caretakers were gently helping an older couple onto the back of a large, feathery creature. It had the wide, watchful eyes of an owl, a powerful bear-like body covered in dappled down, and tucked at its sides—massive, elegant wings folded like cloaks. The creature gave a low, soothing hoot as it crouched to let the riders on, its claws curling into the grass with surprising care.
It moved with the softness of snowfall, each step deliberate, like it was trying not to startle the breeze.
Madeleine nudged him. “Not a nightmare after all, hm?”
“Yeah, I guess so.” Eddie said, but his eyes stayed on the retreating wings. “But I didn’t think Professor Hudson for the type to volunteer here,” he said abruptly. “That man acts like he’d sanitize his hands after petting a puppy or something.”
“He’s head of the Sanctuary’s research program. Has been for years.” Her voice was measured, the way she explained things to spooked animals—gentle but firm. 
“His connections at the university and the Alchemy Ingredients Warehouse keep our supplies stocked.” She continued, “Without him, half the creatures here wouldn’t get their specialized tonics in time.”
Eddie snorted. “Yeah, but does he actually like them? Or are they just… I don’t know, test subjects for him?”
She laughed, “I took his Botanical Alchemy course this year. He’s… meticulous. But people aren’t just one thing, Edward.” A pause, her gaze drifting toward the Back Range. “The man who lectures on ‘precision over passion’ also hand-feeds sugar cubes to the hippogriffs when he thinks no one’s looking.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “You’re telling me that man has a hidden side we don’t know?”
“I’m telling you,” she said, turning to lead him down the path, “That no one is as it seems.”
As they walked deeper into the sanctuary, the cheerful sounds began to fade, replaced by the hush of thickening woods. The trees here grew denser, the canopy forming a living roof that swallowed the sun. The air turned cooler, stiller, and more humid. Eddie noticed the path narrowing as vines and moss crept along the edges, and the sound of their footfalls became muffled on the leafy ground.
Madeleine glanced back at him. “This is part of the containment,” she said. “The trees are grown close on purpose—enchanted and cultivated this way. Nothing with wings can take off easily in here.”
Eddie blinked. “As in… this forest is acting as its cage?”
“A forest as a safety net,” Madeleine corrected gently. “A soft one. The creatures don’t feel trapped, but it keeps everyone safe. Including the creatures.”
They finally stepped into the Back Range, marked by a simple wooden arch wrapped in glowing vines. The shadows here were thick, and the only light came from hanging lanterns and fruits that glowed softly like moonlight—violet, blue, and faintly golden.
Many of the enclosures were hidden by dark fabrics or veils of moss. Muffled growls and low, thudding breaths rumbled from behind them, unseen but deeply felt. One enclosure bore claw marks on the bark of the trees surrounding it, but no sign of the creature inside.
Madeleine’s expression grew somber. “These ones are all recovering,” she said softly. “Most of them were pulled from military use. Trained, abused, pushed past their limits. They weren’t made for war—but they were used like weapons.”
Eddie looked around, his gaze flicking from veil to lantern to the faint glow of eyes peering through a curtain of vines. “So they’re injured?”
“Body and spirit,” she said. “Some are still too aggressive to be handled. Others…” She paused. “Others just need someone to sit near them and remind them they’re not tools.”
The silence that followed was heavier than before. Around them, the woods seemed to watch.
And as they moved forward, Eddie began to see more of the creatures—strange, otherworldly, and awe-inspiring. A towering quadruped with armor-like plates over its shoulders huffed in its sleep. A translucent, almost ghostly winged cat with double pupils crept along the high branches. A half-curled serpent with burning red eyes followed them with its gaze from behind a thick enchanted net.
Eddie gripped his crutch tighter. “Remind me again why we’re walking towards the terrifying creatures?”
Madeleine smirked. “Because you need to see one of them.”
She led Eddie off the path, up a wooden ramp that creaked under their feet, toward one of the enclosed indoor glass sanctuaries tucked between the thick roots of the forest. The structure was built into the trees, its windows fogged and dark, blending into the woodland like a secret hidden in plain sight.
Inside, the light dimmed. The sanctuary enclosure was cloaked in heavy shadow, its interior a terrain of sand, rock, and thick branches stacked like ribs. The plaque on the glass read in precise lettering:

South Alamirian Tiger – Panthera AlamarisFemale. Estimated Age: 7. Confiscated from illegal exotic circus. High reactivity. Do not tap on enclosure.
Eddie shifted his weight onto his crutch and looked around. “Right. So… what exactly am I supposed to see?”
“Keep your voice down,” Madeleine murmured, already crouching near a sack on the side. She reached inside and pulled out a thick slab of meat wrapped in brown cloth. With practiced hands, she unraveled it and picked up a feeding stick—a long rod with a clamp at the end—and gently stabbed the meat.
Eddie was about to ask another question when he heard it.
A low, reverberating growl rolled through the enclosure like a slow thunder. He stiffened.
Madeleine didn’t flinch. She simply walked forward and held the rod out, her voice suddenly soft and coaxing. “Here, girl,” she said, like she was trying to tempt a housecat out from under a couch.
A blur of motion. Something large and lean lunged from the shadows—and in a blink, the meat was gone. Snatched mid-air with a sickening crunch. The rod quivered slightly in Madeleine’s hand.
Then it stepped into view.
Eddie’s breath caught in his throat.
The creature was tall—taller than any normal big cat he’d ever seen. Its body was thin, almost gaunt, but taut with power. A desert-colored coat stretched over sharp muscles, broken only by black stripes like brushstrokes. Its eyes glowed amber in the gloom, wild and intelligent. It prowled low, its massive paws silent against the rock, its tail twitching.
But it wasn’t the size that struck Eddie dumb.
It was the familiarity.
He knew this shape. The lean torso. The long arms. The face—feral but almost knowing.
This was it.
It was the same silhouette that had lunged at him through the firelight back on campus. Except… not quite. This one was unmistakably an animal. Its movements were feline, graceful, natural. Not like the twisted, upright thing that had ambushed him.
Madeleine, still holding the rod, glanced at Eddie and smiled gently. “She’s a South Alamirian Tiger,” she said, her voice tinged with affection. “Hails from the furthest end of the Alamirian Dunes. Not many left in the wild. This one was taken from a traveling circus in the Northern Markets. Starved, overworked, shackled since she was a cub. She barely knew how to use her claws when they brought her in.”
Her eyes sparkled now—pride, defiance, maybe even joy—as she spoke. “She’s the only one we have in the Sanctuary. Took months before she would even let us stand this close. Now she eats from the stick. One day I’m hoping she’ll come right to my hand.”
Eddie didn’t answer right away. He was still watching the tiger, who now licked the blood off her paw with slow, deliberate motions.
Madeleine’s grip tightened on the feeding rod. “Is this what attacked you?”
Eddie shook his head. “No. Not exactly.”
“But it’s close?” Her voice was taut, like a wire about to snap.
“Same claws. Same eyes. Same way it moves—” Eddie’s hands flexed at his sides, as if trying to sculpt the memory out of the air. “But the thing that came at me stood upright. Two legs, like a person. Except…” He shuddered. “It wasn’t pretending to be human. It was like… something had forced it into the shape of one.”
Madeleine went very still. Then, with deliberate slowness, she set the rod down and pulled a small notebook from her pocket. The pages fluttered as she flipped to a blank sheet, her pencil already moving. “Show me,” she said, her tone calm but edged. “Start with the silhouette.”
Eddie leaned in. “Taller than me. Thin, but not starved—wiry.” He watched her sketch the rough outline: a hunched spine, elongated limbs. “Shoulders more… here,” he corrected, tapping the page. Madeleine adjusted the lines without a word.
“The face?” she prompted.
“Feline. But the jaw was wrong—broader.” His finger slashed across the sketch.
Madeleine’s pencil froze. A drop of sweat slid down her temple. “Did it have hands?”
“Not—not quite. The fingers were fused halfway. Like it got stuck mid-change.”
Her pencil snapped. She didn’t seem to notice. The sketch was taking shape now: a grotesque fusion of tiger and man, its posture twisted as if its bones had been broken and reset wrong.
Eddie’s stomach turned. “Yeah. That’s the one.”
Madeleine stared at the drawing, her breath shallow. Around them, the Sanctuary’s usual chorus of chirps and growls had gone eerily quiet, as if the creatures themselves were listening.
“That’s…” she started, then stopped, her jaw clenched. “That’s terrifying.”
Eddie stayed quiet.
“I know.”
“It’s not just that one of them were loose in Edenfield,” she went on, voice low, nearly a whisper. “It’s that I don’t want to imagine what they stitched together to make something like that.”
Eddie swallowed. The silence stretched. Only the soft, wet sound of the tiger chewing filled the air, methodical and primal.
Madeleine finally looked back at him, eyes more focused now. “We need to do something about this.”
Eddie nodded. “We should meet up with the others. At the Library. Midnight as usual.”
Madeleine blinked. Then, slowly, a small smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. She stepped forward and tapped him gently on the arm. “Next week,” she said softly. “You need to rest first.”
Eddie exhaled. He hadn't realized how tightly he’d been gripping his crutch. “Yeah… okay. Next week.”
Madeleine nodded, her expression softening. “I know someone who might be able to help,” she said quietly. “They’ve got connections with the district government—real ones, not just student council nonsense. I can let them know about our next meeting.”
Eddie looked up at her, curious. “You trust them?”
“I do,” she said, firm but calm. “They’ll be glad to help. Especially if something this dangerous is walking around Edenfield.”
Eddie nodded slowly. The silence returned, filled only by the soft crunching of the tiger eating its meal behind the glass. The weight of what they’d just discussed still lingered, but something in Madeleine’s certainty settled him a little.
Outside, the leaves rustled in the thick trees above. The tiger, finished with her meal, settled back into the shadows, vanishing like a ghost into the enclosure’s far corner.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 31 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by her son's room's oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 
Concerned but curious, she turned the handle and opened the door. The familiar scent of Eddie’s room—salt from the sea breeze. The faint aroma of old parchment and a hint of potion ingredients—welcomed her.
But something was different. The made bed, usually a tangled mess of blankets and pillows, was a change. The covers were pulled tight. Pillows fluffed and positioned just so as if someone had taken care to leave it in perfect order. Once cluttered with scattered papers, half-opened books, and potion vials, his desk was now arranged in neat stacks. Someone had carefully piled the old, dusty alchemical texts—a level of care unseen for years.
Her eyes moved to the window. It was open, letting the golden morning light pour in, warmly bathing the room. The soft murmur of the sea drifted in, accompanied by the cry of gulls. 
Eddie was gone, but not in the way he used to disappear into himself. This time, something had changed.
A soft smile tugged at the corners of her lips. Her heart swelled with quiet joy as she realised what had happened. Eddie had finally woken up—not just from sleep, but from the fog of despair that had weighed him down for seven years. He had tidied his room, made his bed, and left purposefully. The message, crystal clear, was silent. He was ready to move forward and re-engage with the world outside.
She stood there for a few moments longer, taking it in, feeling pride swell in her chest. Eddie, her boy, was finding his way again.
On the wall of his room, there is a new calendar, this one is clean, with no mark.
There is a circle on it.
5th of January, 1928.
It was today.
With a soft sigh of contentment. She shut the door behind her, allowing the room to be quiet. She turned and made her way downstairs, a little lighter on her feet, a little more at peace, knowing her son was beginning a new chapter.
She had a day to get on with—the apothecary to tend to, potions to brew, customers to assist—but everything seemed just a little brighter now. Eddie had woken up from his long slumber, and that was all she needed to know.

            <Title>Chapter 1E</Title>
            <Text>The night bus trundled along the cobblestone streets of Edenfield, its wheels clattering softly in the stillness of the evening. The soft hum of magic resonating through its mechanisms gave the ride a smoothness that belied its outwardly rustic appearance. Inside, the lanterns cast a gentle, flickering light, illuminating the small interior where a handful of passengers sat quietly, lost in their thoughts or conversations.
Eddie and Ashley sat side by side near the middle of the bus, the wooden seat creaking softly beneath them as they swayed gently with the vehicle’s movement. The handlebars above their heads swung slightly, following the rhythm of the bus’s journey. Will, sprawled across the seat behind them, snored lightly, his head tilted back against the window. Every so often, his lips would part in an unintelligible mumble, and Ashley couldn’t help but smirk as she glanced back at him.
“Still out like a light,” she murmured, her tone amused.
Eddie chuckled softly, his gaze fixed on the view outside. The bus had just crossed the bridge that separated the southern and northern districts of Edenfield. The transformation was striking—the low, suburban charm of the university's vicinity gave way to towering stone edifices adorned with intricate carvings. Streetlamps glowed brighter here, casting the grand buildings in a warm amber light, their shadows stretching elegantly across the polished stone streets.
“It’s different here,” Eddie said quietly, his voice filled with a mix of curiosity and awe.
Ashley followed his gaze, nodding. “Yeah. The northern district is something else. You can feel the history here, can’t you? The closer you get to the palace, the grander everything becomes.”
Eddie leaned forward slightly, his green eyes reflecting the golden light of the passing streetlamps. The buildings were more imposing here, each one telling its own story with ornate gargoyles perched on ledges and massive windows framed by columns. It was easy to imagine the kings of old walking these streets, their retinues trailing behind them.
“Do you think the Mayor actually lives in the palace?” Eddie asked, breaking the silence.
Ashley shrugged, resting her chin on her hand. “Probably. I mean, if you were in charge of the city and had a palace at your disposal, wouldn’t you want to live there? Seems like a waste if they didn’t.” She glanced at Eddie, a sly smile tugging at her lips. “Not that we’ll ever find out. People like us don’t exactly get invitations to the Mayor’s office.”
Eddie laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah, I think we’re more ‘southern district tavern’ types than ‘northern district palace’ types.”
The bus slowed as it passed by a small plaza where a fountain gurgled softly in the moonlight, its waters shimmering like liquid silver. Beyond it, a tall spire rose into the sky, the clock at its peak illuminated against the night. Eddie’s gaze lingered on the fountain for a moment before shifting to the rain-slick streets outside. The quiet patter of rain against the bus windows matched the rhythm of his thoughts, pulling him inward.
His mind wandered to Madeleine. During the final preparations for their exams, she had seemed distant, her usual warmth replaced by something quieter, heavier. He thought of the moment in the infirmary, when Walther had said to her, “You were right.” The words played over and over in his mind. Right about what? And why had that simple phrase seemed to cut Madeleine so deeply? Whatever it was, it had driven a wedge between them—her smiles became fewer, her words more guarded. And then, just like that, she had started avoiding him altogether.
Eddie sighed softly, his green eyes clouded with uncertainty. He wondered if their visit tonight would even make a difference, or if Madeleine would simply push him further away.
“Eddie,” Ashley’s voice pulled him back, gentle yet firm. She was watching him, her head tilted slightly, her expression no longer playful but thoughtful. “You’ve got that look again. The one where you’re thinking too much.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow, trying to deflect. “Thinking isn’t a bad thing, you know.”
“No, but you overthink,” Ashley said, though her teasing edge was softer this time. “What were you thinking this time, Eddie? The finals are over—there’s nothing to overthink about.”
For a moment, he hesitated, unsure if he wanted to voice the thoughts swirling in his head. But the words spilled out anyway. “Madeleine,” he said quietly. “She’s been...distant. During the finals prep, she barely spoke to me. I keep thinking about that day in the infirmary—what Walther said to her. ‘You were right.’ What did that mean? Why did it upset her so much?”
Ashley didn’t reply immediately. She turned her gaze to the rain-speckled window, her reflection distorted by the water streaking down the glass. When she looked back at him, her smile was somber, her tone serious. “Eddie,” she said softly, “You like her, don’t you?”
The rain outside intensified, the rhythmic patter a low hum that filled the silence between them. The bus trudged along through the slick streets, its warm lantern light contrasting with the cold, wet world outside. Ashley’s question hung in the air, and Eddie felt the weight of it pressing down on him. There was no teasing in her voice, no attempt to lighten the mood. She was serious, and it demanded a serious answer.
Eddie looked away, his jade-green eyes fixed on the rain-blurred view of the northern district. The spires of Edenfield Palace were just visible through the haze, a distant silhouette against the stormy sky. “Yeah,” he admitted at last, his voice steady but quiet. “I think so.”
Ashley didn’t respond right away. She simply nodded, her gaze softening as she looked at him. The bus continued its steady trek through the rain, the passengers lulled into a contemplative silence by the dim light and the persistent rhythm of the journey. Eddie didn’t know what to expect from Madeleine when they saw her tonight—or if she would even want to see them. But for now, he let the silence stretch, a quiet acknowledgment of his own feelings.
Eddie couldn’t help but smile, leaning back against the seat. He let the conversation drift as the bus continued its journey, the sights of the northern district passing by like scenes from a storybook. The thought of Madeleine and their impromptu visit loomed in his mind, a mix of nervousness and excitement bubbling beneath the surface.
Behind them, Will let out a particularly loud snore, startling a couple of passengers seated nearby. Ashley stifled a laugh, shaking her head. “He’s going to regret this in the morning.”
Eddie glanced back at his friend, a small, fond smile playing on his lips. “Yeah, but that’s a problem for tomorrow.”
The bus turned a corner, and up ahead, the glow of the northern district’s central square came into view. The spires of Edenfield Palace loomed in the distance, their majestic silhouettes cutting against the starry sky. The sense of anticipation grew stronger as the bus continued onward, carrying them closer to their destination and, perhaps, a memorable conclusion to an already extraordinary day.

-o-

The rain was relentless, turning the cobblestone streets into glistening ribbons that reflected the warm glow of the streetlamps. Eddie clutched his small pocket journal tightly, shielding it from the rain as he squinted at the hastily scrawled address. Drops of water streaked down his forehead, but he didn’t seem to notice.
“This way,” he called, pointing to a side street flanked by tall, elegant stone buildings. “I think.”
Ashley laughed as she darted from one awning to the next, her cloak swishing behind her. “You think? Eddie, you’ve been staring at that thing for ten minutes.”
“It’s not an exact science, all right?” Eddie shot back, grinning despite himself. The rain was cold, but their shared adventure added a warmth to the night that kept them moving.
Will, trailing behind and holding his coat over his head, finally caught up, his boots splashing through shallow puddles. “I’m just saying,” he said, his voice tinged with mock exasperation, “if Henry’s memory is as hazy as the hangover I’m getting over, we’re going to be wandering around here all night.”
“Oh, come on, Will,” Ashley teased, spinning briefly in the rain as if to emphasize her point. “You don’t get to complain when you’re not the one navigating.”
Eddie smirked, flipping his wet journal closed and tucking it back into his coat pocket. “Besides, it’s not every day you get to explore the northern district. Even in the rain.”
Ashley gasped dramatically, stretching her arms out as she stepped into the middle of the street. “The grandeur! The elegance! The—ugh, the puddles.” She looked down, realizing she’d splashed straight into a particularly deep one, soaking her boots.
Will chuckled, his earlier grumbling forgotten as he looked around. “All right, I’ll admit it’s not bad. Kind of a change from the cozy university vibe. But are we close? Please tell me we’re close.”
Eddie opened his journal again, stepping beneath a narrow overhang to read. The paper was slightly damp, the ink smudged, but still legible. “Henry said it’s an apartment complex... there!” He pointed to a tall building with ivy climbing its weathered stone facade. “Number 14, third floor.”
Ashley and Will exchanged glances, then grinned mischievously at Eddie. “Last one there’s paying for dessert!” Ashley shouted, taking off toward the building.
“Hey!” Eddie protested, breaking into a jog to keep up.
Will groaned but followed, muttering, “Why do I always get dragged into these things?”
They weaved through the rain-soaked street, splashing through puddles and laughing as their cloaks billowed behind them. Despite the chill and the wet, the moment was filled with a sense of camaraderie and carefree joy—like they were defying the storm itself. By the time they reached the stoop of Madeleine’s apartment, all three were soaked but breathless with laughter.
Eddie leaned against the doorframe, catching his breath. “Well,” he said between chuckles, “at least we found it. And nobody twisted an ankle.”
Ashley wrung out the edge of her cloak, her eyes sparkling with mirth. “I don’t know what’s better—finding Madeleine’s place or watching you try to keep up.”
Will flopped dramatically against the wall, panting. “I’m calling it now. I’m never running in the rain again.”
The three of them shared another laugh before Eddie stepped forward, his hand poised to knock on the heavy wooden door. The sound echoed faintly in the rain-drenched silence, and for a brief moment, the lightheartedness of their search gave way to anticipation.
-o-
The exterior of Madeleine's apartment building loomed before them, a testament to the elegance of the northern district. Its stone facade was intricately carved with floral and geometric patterns, each detail lending the building an air of quiet grandeur. Tall windows lined the front, their frames painted a deep emerald green that gleamed faintly even in the rain. A brass plaque near the door bore the name of the residence in flowing script: Alderstone Heights.
Eddie, Will, and Ashley exchanged glances before stepping inside. The warmth of the lobby enveloped them, a stark contrast to the chill outside. The interior was just as magnificent as the exterior—polished marble floors, a sweeping staircase with a wrought-iron banister, and a crystal chandelier casting soft light across the space. Behind a mahogany desk at the far end of the lobby sat a sharply dressed receptionist, an older man with graying hair and a meticulous demeanor.
As the trio approached, the receptionist looked up from a ledger, his brow arching slightly in curiosity. “Good evening,” he greeted, his voice even and polite. “May I help you?”
“We’re looking for someone,” Eddie said, stepping forward. “Madeleine Daedallia.”
The receptionist straightened slightly, his gaze sweeping over the trio. “And who might you be?” he asked. “If you don’t mind, I’ll need to know how you’re acquainted with Miss Daedallia.”
“We’re her friends,” Ashley chimed in with a smile. “From Edenfield University.”
The receptionist’s expression softened slightly at the mention of the university. “Ah, students, then.” He reached for a small notepad. “I’ll need your names, just for the record.”
Eddie quickly obliged. “I’m Eddie Welton, and this is William Chester,” He trailed off as Will raised a hand in greeting. “And Ashley Mayfair.”
The receptionist jotted their names down before looking up again, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. “Do you, by chance, know someone by the name of Walther?”
Will’s eyebrows shot up. “Yeah, I do,” he said. “He’s our friend too. We were dorm mates.”
The receptionist chuckled, setting his pen down. “Well, it seems like quite the university celebration tonight. Mr. Walther was here earlier, also asking to see Miss Daedallia. He mentioned he was a friend from the university as well.” There was a hint of nostalgia in his tone as he added, “Ah, youth. It takes me back to my own days of camaraderie and last-minute visits.”
Eddie, Will, and Ashley exchanged glances, their expressions ranging from surprise to unease. Eddie managed a polite smile. “Thanks for letting us know. Can you tell us which floor and room she’s in?”
The receptionist nodded, flipping through a ledger before providing the details. “Third floor, apartment 17. If you take the lift, it’ll be on your left as you exit.”
The three of them thanked him before heading toward the lift, their footsteps echoing faintly in the grand lobby.
As the lift doors closed behind them, Ashley was the first to speak. “Is it just me, or is it a little strange that Walther’s here too?” Her voice was quiet, tinged with suspicion.
Eddie nodded. “It is. Madeleine’s been distant lately, and Walther... he doesn’t strike me as the type to just drop by unannounced.”
Will leaned casually against the wall, his arms crossed. “You’re both reading too much into this. Walther and Madeleine are classmates, right? They could be working on a group project. Finals week and all that.”
Ashley folded her arms, unconvinced. “Still, it feels off. Something about the way Madeleine’s been acting…”
Before she could finish, Will smirked and nudged Eddie with his elbow. “Or maybe Eddie’s just jealous. You worried Walther’s got more to do with Madeleine than a group project?”
Eddie groaned, punching Will’s arm lightly. “Knock it off, Will.”
“Ow!” Will clutched his arm dramatically. “Abuse! I’m filing a complaint with the university!”
Ashley chuckled at their antics, the tension in the air dissipating slightly. “All right, children,” she teased. “Let’s stay focused. We’re here to thank Madeleine, not start a soap opera.”
Eddie, Will, and Ashley stood before the ornate elevator, its polished brass doors gleaming under the lobby’s soft lighting. The panel beside it bore a series of numbered buttons and a small speaker grille. All three stared at it like it was some sort of magical artifact.
“Do I press it?” Eddie asked, his finger hovering over the buttons. “What are these numbers for?”
“Maybe... the floor numbers?” Will guessed, squinting at the panel. “But there’s way too many for just floors. Look, there’s a speaker here too. Do you think it talks back?”
Ashley, who was equally baffled but determined not to show it, tilted her head. “It’s probably some fancy city thing. Let’s not mess with it until we know what we’re doing.”
As if summoned by fate, a butler passed by, his white gloves pristine and his steps measured. Ashley flagged him down. “Excuse me! Could you help us? We’ve, uh... never used one of these before.”
The butler paused, looking at the trio with mild amusement. “Ah, of course. You must not be from the northern district.”
“We’re from the southern side,” Will said, scratching the back of his head. “Elevators aren’t really... a thing there.”
The butler offered a patient smile. “This is a secured elevator system. To use it, you’ll need to input both the floor number and the apartment number of the person you’re visiting. The occupant will then answer through the intercom and allow you access if they’re expecting you.”
Ashley’s eyes widened. “That’s... really secure.”
“It is,” the butler agreed. “Most residences here prioritize safety. Would you like me to assist you?”
“No, no! We can handle it,” Ashley said quickly, giving him a grateful nod. “Thanks for explaining.”
The butler tipped his head politely and walked away, leaving the three to puzzle it out.
Eddie pulled out his notebook and read aloud. “Okay, third floor, apartment 17.”
Will squinted at the buttons. “So we press... three, then one, then seven?”
“Probably,” Ashley said, though she didn’t sound entirely confident. “Try it.”
Eddie pressed the buttons cautiously. The speaker crackled to life, startling all three of them.
“Hello?” came a muffled, feminine voice.
“Oh! Uh, hi!” Eddie stammered, leaning toward the intercom as if it were a person. “It’s Eddie! From the university. We’re here with Will and Ashley.”
There was a pause before the voice responded, slightly more clearly. “Eddie? What are you doing here?”
Eddie glanced at Will and Ashley, unsure what to say. Ashley nudged him and whispered, “Tell her we came to thank her.”
“Right!” Eddie cleared his throat. “We just wanted to, uh, thank you for all your help during finals.”
Another pause. “...Give me a moment.”
The intercom clicked off, and the elevator doors opened with a soft chime. The three of them stepped inside, the plush interior of the elevator feeling almost regal. The walls were lined with polished wood, and a small chandelier hung overhead.
“Whoa,” Will said, running his hand along the railing. “This is fancier than the whole dorm building.”
“Look at this carpet,” Ashley added, nudging Eddie. “I think this thing’s more comfortable than our beds.”
Eddie chuckled, pressing the button for the third floor. “No wonder Madeleine’s so composed all the time. Living here, how could you not be?”
Will leaned against the wall, smirking. “Fancy place, fancy people. You sure you don’t feel a little out of place, Eddie?”
Eddie shot him a mock glare. “Says the guy drooling over the elevator.”
Ashley laughed, shaking her head. “I can’t believe we needed instructions to use an elevator. They’re probably laughing at us down there.”
“Let them laugh,” Will declared, grinning. “This thing’s magic. We’ll figure it out eventually.”
As the elevator ascended, its soft hum providing a backdrop to their conversation, Ashley held up a neatly wrapped basket brimming with pastries. “So, what do you think? These are Madeleine’s favorites. She’s going to love them.”
Will snorted, crossing his arms and nodding toward his bag. “Pastries? Come on, Ash. That’s like saying, ‘Hey, I didn’t know what to get you, so here’s food.’ I, on the other hand, got her something practical.” He pulled out a small, carefully packed set of sculpting tools. “She’s into alchemical sculpting, right? These are top-notch tools. Way more meaningful than a snack.”
Ashley narrowed her eyes, planting her hands on her hips. “A snack? These are artisanal pastries! Handpicked by yours truly. You can’t sculpt your way to happiness, but you can eat your way there.”
Eddie chuckled from the corner, holding up his gift—a tin of Eden Flower Tea. “You’re both wrong. Madeleine always gets this tea at the cafeteria. It’s comforting and familiar. She’ll appreciate it more than tools she might already have or pastries she could buy herself.”
Will rolled his eyes. “Tea? Really, Eddie? You’re going to give her café tea? That’s what people drink when they’re stressed, not what they celebrate with. You’ve got to think bigger!”
Ashley chimed in, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Yeah, Eddie. Tea’s sweet and all, but it’s not exactly memorable. You’re giving her homework vibes, like, ‘Here’s some tea for those late-night study sessions.’ At least my pastries have personality!”
“Personality?” Eddie shot back, raising an eyebrow. “You’re literally bribing her taste buds. And Will, your tools are practical, sure, but you’re basically saying, ‘Here, get back to work.’ My tea is thoughtful.”
Will grinned mischievously. “Okay, Mr. Thoughtful. What’s she going to think when you hand her a beverage? ‘Oh wow, Eddie knows I get tired easily?’ Great message.”
Ashley burst out laughing. “Oh, stop it! You both sound ridiculous. The pastries are clearly the winner here. They’re personal and delicious.”
Eddie shook his head, though he was smiling. “You’re both impossible. Maybe we should’ve pooled our money and gotten her something together.”
Will scoffed. “Nah, this is better. Three gifts are better than one. It’s like a competition—she’ll decide who knows her best.”
Ashley snorted. “As if this is a contest. We all know I’m winning this.”
“Dream on,” Will replied, leaning back against the elevator wall with a smirk. “She’s going to love my tools. They’re useful and thoughtful. Yours are just carbs.”
“And tea is just leaves,” Ashley quipped, shooting Eddie a playful grin.
Eddie sighed dramatically. “Why do I even bother? You two are hopeless.”
The elevator dinged, signaling their arrival at the third floor. As the doors slid open, they stepped out, still bickering over whose gift would win Madeleine’s heart. Despite their banter, there was a shared warmth between them, their playful argument only deepening their bond.

            <Title>Chapter 17 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Torrie settled down at the side of the Traveller’s Path as the night deepened around them. The glowing Eden Flowers cast a gentle, golden light over the path, creating a serene atmosphere amidst the dense darkness of the Deep Glaive. Eddie sat on the edge of the path, his gaze fixed on the flickering lights of the Eden Flowers. On the other hand, Torrie focused on a more delicate task. She deftly wove Eden Flowers into a crown, her small fingers moving with practised ease.
Eddie glanced at her, a hint of curiosity in his voice. “So, Torrie, how do you feel about seeing Catherine again?”
Torrie looked up from her flower crown, her expression of thoughtful satisfaction. “I’m happy. Not every day you meet someone with so much knowledge and experience. Aunt Catherine has travelled far and studied so much. Being able to learn from her is fascinating.”
“Yeah,” Eddie flashed a faint smile “it’s... good to see her again.”
Torrie’s smile widened slightly but didn’t reach her eyes as much as before. “And what about you? How do you feel about meeting her again?”
Eddie shrugged, his tone neutral. “It’s alright.”
Torrie’s smile faltered, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Eddie’s face. “Just that? Nothing else fascinates you about her return?”
The shift in Torrie’s tone was subtle but unmistakable. The casualness of the conversation began to dissipate, replaced by an undercurrent of tension. Eddie’s smile faded, and he looked away, his expression suddenly distant.
“It’s just... seeing her again is... cool… She’s awesome.” Eddie replied, his voice lacking its earlier warmth. He glanced at Torrie, whose previously bright demeanour had now shifted to something more serious.
Torrie’s eyes searched his face, her gaze intense. “Are you telling me that’s all there is to it? You don’t feel anything else about her returning after all this time?”
Eddie shifted uncomfortably. “It’s not like that. I just... I don’t know. She’s still the same person she was before.”
Torrie’s smile had vanished entirely, replaced by a frown of concern and confusion. “Eddie, I thought you’d be more... interested. You used to look up to her so much. Doesn’t it bother you that she seems different now?”
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the side, avoiding her piercing gaze. “Maybe. I don’t know.”
The air between them grew thicker, with unspoken emotions. Torrie’s frustration and Eddie’s indifference created a palpable tension. Torrie’s fingers paused mid-motion with the flower crown, her face a mask of frustration and hurt.
The Eden Flowers glowed softly. Their light cast long shadows that danced across their faces. The once-comforting glow now seemed to highlight the distance growing between them.
Torrie finally broke the silence, her voice quiet but firm. “If you’re not interested in seeing what’s different, then...” Her voice ceded down
 “why are you even here?”

-o-

The moonlight pierced through the dense canopy of the Deep Glaive, casting jagged patterns across the forest floor. Twisted vines and ancient trees loomed like sentinels, their gnarled forms seeming almost alive in the shifting light. The forest was oppressively silent, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant, haunting call of some unseen creature. 

Markus walked behind Catherine, his grip tight on Eddie’s flintlock rifle. The weapon was raised, its polished barrel glinting faintly in the pale light. Every whisper of movement sent his heart racing, his eyes darting toward every shadow. At the slightest rustle of a bush, the rifle twitched in his hands, his finger hovering dangerously close to the trigger. 

Catherine could hear the weapon rattling and flinging around, her staff resting lightly in her grip. Her expression was calm but sharp. She noticed Markus’s shoulders hunched, his steps jerky and uncertain, and the tension in his grip on the rifle. The unease was palpable, and the oppressive atmosphere was clearly getting to him. 

“Markus,” she said softly, breaking the silence with an even tone, “you’re holding that thing like we’re about to be ambushed by an army of bandits.” 

Markus shot her a glance, his voice tense. “Feels like we might be. This place... it’s not normal. I feel like something’s watching us.” He turned sharply at another rustling sound, aiming the rifle toward the underbrush. It was just a gust of wind stirring the leaves. 

Catherine stopped for a moment, letting her staff tap the ground lightly. “You’re going to give yourself a heart attack before we even find the Artefact.” She smiled, trying to inject a bit of levity. “Besides, I don’t think Eddie would appreciate you wasting all his precious gunpowder on small critters.” 

Markus lowered the rifle but kept it ready. “Easy for you to joke, ma’am! You’ve got magic if something happens. I’ve got only this—and it’s not exactly comforting.” He gave the rifle a wary look as if it might betray him at any moment. 

She stepped closer, her voice quiet but steady. “We’ll be fine. I’ve been through worse, believe me. And I promise you won’t be facing it alone if anything comes at us.” 

Markus glanced at her, the tension in his jaw easing slightly. “Alright,” he muttered. “But I’m still keeping this thing ready.” 

They continued deeper into the forest. The oppressive silence seemed to press in even closer, the darkness growing thicker. Catherine kept her senses sharp, but she made a mental note to keep talking—it seemed to keep Markus from completely unravelling. 

“You know,” she began, her tone conversational, “I used to visit Eddie’s home a lot when he was younger. We’d go adventuring in old ruins, exploring caves and abandoned barns. I thought I was pretty brave back then. But this? An illusory forest with who-knows-what lurking around? A first for me.” 

Markus glanced at her, his face pale. “Really? That must have been something.” 

Catherine nodded with a reminiscent smile. “It was. Eddie used to love going off-trail, never sticking to the safe paths. He was always adventurous, seeking new experiences, no matter the danger. We’d found ourselves in trouble countless times, but Eddie always seemed to enjoy the thrill of it. His older brother Alfred and I often had to help him out of those scrapes.” 

Markus swallowed hard, his nerves evident. “Eddie... he seems different now. He doesn’t seem like the same person.” 

Catherine’s smile faded slightly as she looked at Markus. “Different? How so?” 

Markus took a deep breath, his voice trembling slightly. “Well, there’s a reason for that. Back at the academy, a kid named Davies heavily bullied me. I wasn’t as adept at magic as the others, so I was an easy target. Eddie was always my friend because he didn’t quite fit in. He’d spend time with me instead of those other guys.” 

Markus paused, his eyes reflecting the dim light. “One day, when Davies was particularly brutal, Eddie was there. He was impulsive, as he always was, and he challenged Davies to a duel. None of us knew how it would end. Davies didn’t take Eddie seriously, but during the duel, Eddie accidentally scarred Davies’ face. It was a mess, and Eddie got expelled from the academy.” 

Catherine’s expression shifted from curiosity to shock and sympathy. “I had no idea. Eddie never spoke about it in detail. I’ve always wondered why he seemed so distant.” 

Markus nodded, his gaze dropping. “It was a turning point for him. He became cold and withdrawn after that. It’s like he lost something important to him.” 

Catherine sighed, her heart heavy with the weight of newfound understanding. “I wish I had known. I might have been able to help him see past it and rekindle his love for magic. I hope that’s still possible.” </Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 5</Title>
            <Text>The darkly lit apothecary was filled with the smell of herbs and oils. Eddie pushed the broom over the hardwood floor, the quiet, rhythmic swish reverberating in the motionless store, a lonely sound in a still universe. The shopfront was bathed in lantern light and a candle's subtle dance on the counter as daylight faded.
Markus had left a while ago, and Lydia had bid her goodbyes hours earlier. Now, it was just Eddie, enveloped in a space that oscillated between a warm embrace and a suffocating silence.
He pushed the broom casually, not noticing the dust and crumbs on the floor. He contemplated the pub conversation. Markus's comments hit hard, unfolding slowly like a dream in the night. 
Eddie never considered it that way. Each syllable of Markus's remarks stabbed deeper and had an unanticipated weight in his thinking. Envy? Disappointment? Markus had always been there, able to laugh off Eddie's mistakes with a grin and a joke. But this? This seemed unlike him.
Since that encounter, Markus's frustrated and vulnerable tone continued to loop in his brain over and over like a broken record. Eddie never realised the impact of his decisions and mistakes on others, leaving traces he never considered. His mind kept thinking about it. Had Markus always been that resentful towards him? Watching him miss opportunities Markus could only dream of?
Eddie came to understand that it was never solely about magic. But of Possibility. Achievement. The sort of future that seemed perpetually out of reach for Markus. And Eddie had allowed it all to slip through his fingers, oblivious to the pain it might inflict on those nearest to him.
He glanced up at the shelves, curious. Dried herbs, tinctures, and little vials line the walls like troops waiting for a command. Everything had unfolded as a result of his father’s influence—his father’s enterprise, his father’s aspirations.
His father.
Eddie wiped his fingers on his face to erase the shadowy feeling. Mr. Welton was always a dreamer. He lived with serene conviction, never questioning his decisions and constantly encouraging him to fulfil his full potential. 
Eddie momentarily rested on the broom, wondering whether it was the bird metaphor should’ve meant. This morning, the Blue Songbird flew. However, his look conveyed an underlying emotion as he watched the bird fly into the sky.
It was as if his father had been waiting for Eddie to notice it, to see it as more than just a simple act of freeing a beloved bird. Perhaps it was a sign. A nudge, as Markus had put it. But what was Eddie supposed to do with it?
He shifted his gaze to the counter. The waning candlelight danced softly upon the grain of the wood. It stretches its elongated shadows across the gleaming surface of the wood. The apothecary was a small, tranquil refuge, yet it had transformed into a prison of his own design, its walls closing in around him.
Eddie saw a shadow as he swept the final shopfront window corner. Under the flickering gas light outside, everything seems odd. Looking up, his breath stopped in his chest
A hooded figure stared at the apothecary in the faint light of the gas lamp. Eddie tightened his grasp on the broom handle and slowed. Their stance was too steady and purposeful.
For a moment, Eddie attempted to ignore his sense of unease. It was late. Maybe a late-night wanderer? Is someone going home? Maybe they were fatigued and lost in thought.
He focused back on the sweeping, but the unease didn’t let up. There was something about the way the figure stood. The way their presence seemed to linger a little too long. Eddie’s eyes flickered back to the shadow beneath the lamplight.
The figure hadn’t moved.
Eddie’s pulse quickened, but he tried to push the feeling away. “Come on, get a grip, god damn it.” he muttered under his breath. He had enough to worry about—his father, the shop, Markus’s comment towards him, his own restless thoughts. But still, the figure remained. Silent and unmoving, casting a long shadow on the cobbled street.
Then, without warning, the figure began to move.
Slowly. Methodically. Each stride towards the shop was deliberate and calculated. Eddie's gut wrenched, heart accelerated. The figure vanished. it approached him directly.
Slowly. Methodically. Each stride towards the shop was deliberate and calculated. Eddie's gut wrenched, heart accelerated. 
Eddie realised the figure was a woman as it approached. Her dark cloak with a deep hood hid her face. He was mainly impressed by her crimson coat below. Red cloth peeping out from black, like a bloodstain in the night.
Stable, quiet footfall emanated from the lady. Her speed never slowed as she approached.
He told himself it was nothing. Just a passerby, maybe someone with a message or inquiry. But the way she moved, the cold air around her, it wasn’t normal. It felt... ominous.
The lady was now at the shop's doorway, a few feet away. Her black cloak flaps in the wind.
The lady raised her brass mahogany staff and tapped it gently against the front glass door. The sound echoed through the quiet shop, deliberate and unhurried—each tap as methodical as her approach.
Eddie hesitated, the broom still in his hand, his body tense, but he forced himself to breathe, to act normal. 
“I’m sorry,” Eddie finally said, his voice polite, though his unease tugged at his words. “We’re closed. We don’t serve customers at this hour.”
The Lady in Red Coat was unfazed. She remained motionless. Her eyes were fixated on Eddie through the glass, the night's shadows hiding her face. But not her frightening glint emerald eyes. Her chin rose slightly. She smiled, as if his reaction delighted her.
“How about an old friend?” she replied.
Her voice was smooth. It laces with an easy familiarity that sent a shiver down Eddie’s spine.
Eddie's heart jumped. An old friend? The words were cryptic. Who the hell is she? Someone from his past? A forgotten friend? Eddie doesn't recognise the figure.
A dozen names and faces sprang to his mind, but none suited the intriguing lady before him. The question made him choke on his breath. Does he know her?
Eddie froze. Her coldness lingered between them as she stared at him. He opened his mouth to speak. He wanted to remind her that it was late and he couldn't serve anybody. His instincts kept him back. Her words had an intangible pull that compelled him to allow her in and embrace it.
A sigh escaped his lips, the resistance fading like a fog lifting. “One more order it is,” He muttered to himself.
He turned the lights back on, lighting the apothecary softly. As he lifted the latch and pulled open the door, the storefront echoed its unlocking.
The Lady in Red Coat entered quietly. The hardwood floor creaked when her boots clicked. She studied the room with her glance without speaking. 
Eddie returned to the reception table. Leaning on the counter, he folded his hands and watched her. She exuded calm authority, like she knew something he didn't. 
Her black, silky cloak trailed after her like a shadow, its edges moving with a subtle charm. Eddie could now see her red coat—bright and brilliant against the dark, flowing softly over her legs and hinting at her exquisite figure—under the cloak. 
Her fingers brushed over a glass jar filled with shimmering blue powder. She touches lightly, testing its weight. She held a few fragile vials of rare tinctures and resins. Eddie noticed her deliberate, slow movements. She seemed in control. Eddie was uneasy about a skilled hand examining the potions and elixirs.
As she stopped by a shelf of dried sage and cinnamon sticks, her eyes flicked toward Eddie for the first time, meeting his gaze directly.
“You run quite an establishment here, Mr Welton,” she said, her voice soft, deep and yet cutting through the silence like a blade.
Eddie swallowed hard, reflexively standing himself, seeing the contrast between her grace and his slouching. The chamber seemed heavy as she approached, the apothecary's soft hum quieting. Her footsteps resonated like a pulse, infusing the air with an inexplicable energy that made it electric.
He stammered, his usual cheer faltering under her gaze. “How can I—”
But before he could finish, she raised a gloved hand, and the gracefulness of her movements struck him. “I have come seeking a matter of great significance,” she remarked elegantly.
“What... what are you looking for?” Eddie managed to ask, his heart racing as a mix of curiosity and apprehension bubbled within him.
The Lady in Red Coat approached, her eyes shining. “I am on a quest for that which is truly remarkable, a treasure that dances just beyond the reach of the mundane..” Her eyes scanned the shelves, examining the various vials and jars. “And I hold a firm belief that it may dwell within your very grasp.”
Her grin expanded, expressing enjoyment, but her eyes remained intense. “It appears I have stumbled upon the perfect place. Robert Welton is indeed a figure of some renown, yet my curiosity extends beyond merely his talents.” She approached, her demeanour changing gently as if she were surrounding a valuable information.
Eddie swallowed hard, feeling the tension in the air tighten like a drawn bowstring. “I—I don’t understand. What is it that you need?” he stammered, trying to keep his composure. The thought of secrets swirling in the depths of her cloaked figure made him uneasy. He could hear the distant sound of waves crashing against the shore, a reminder of the normalcy that felt like a world away.
“Perhaps you will soon,” she replied cryptically. The corners of her lips curled into a smile that sent another chill racing through him. “I find myself in possession of a venture that yearns for the deft hand of a master, and I am convinced that the Alchemist residing within these very walls possesses the skill I seek.”
The tension hung thick in the air as the Lady in the Red Coat continued to observe Eddie, a knowing glint in her eye that made him feel even more on edge. A slow smirk played on her lips as if she was savouring a delicious secret that only she could fully comprehend.
“I would like to place an order,” she proclaimed, her voice flowing with a measured grace. “I seek the fabled Elixir of the illustrious Philosopher’s Stone.”
Eddie’s heart sank at the mention of the fabled elixir. “There’s no such thing as the Elixir of the Philosopher’s Stone.” he stammered, his mind racing to process what she was asking. Even the existence of the Philosopher’s Stone was a long-standing myth, its origins shrouded in ambiguity and legend. “I’m sorry, but we don’t have it,” he said, trying to keep his tone polite but firm.
The Lady drew nearer, her gaze sharpening with a flicker of intrigue, as curiosity stirred within her heart. “Pray tell, what grants you such unwavering confidence in its nonexistence?”
“Because it’s just a myth,” Eddie replied, his voice trembling as uncertainty gnawed at him. “It’s never been proven to exist in any real form.”
“Is that indeed the case?” She pressed forth, her smile broadening.
Eddie nodded, feeling the heat rise to his cheeks. He wished he could stand taller, and appear more confident, but her presence felt overwhelming.
Then, without a flicker of gaze averted, the Lady drew nearer still. “Pray, Dost thou know who I verily am?”
Eddie froze, caught off guard by her question. He glanced at the intricate embroidery of her cloak, the vibrant red of her coat, the glimmer of her golden buttons, and the staff she held, which seemed to pulse with an aura of authority. As he took in the details, he felt a shiver run down his spine.
At that moment, everything clicked into place, the pieces of the puzzle coming together in a whirlwind of realisation. “You’re a Master Alchemist.”
As the tension in the air thickened, The Lady in Red Coat reached up and slowly lowered her hood. The dim light of the apothecary illuminated her features. It reveals a familiar face that makes Eddie’s heart skip a beat. Her short, bright red hair framed her face perfectly. Glinting like polished copper in the warm light. High cheekbones accentuated her fair skin, and her striking emerald green eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint.
“Catherine?” he exclaimed, his voice a mix of disbelief and confusion.
Her elvish ears peeked out from beneath her hair. It adds an ethereal quality to her already captivating appearance. She wore a mischievous smile. One that transformed the atmosphere from ominous to delightfully playful. “Surprise!” she said, her tone shifting. “Did you really think I was an assassin? Perchance just a very dramatic alchemist?”
Eddie blinked in realisation, laughter bubbling up despite the earlier tension. “I swear, every alchemist I’ve met has to act mysterious, shrouded in allegory and cryptic hints, I’m fucking done.”
Catherine chuckled, her eyes sparkling with humour. “It’s part of the job description, you know. How else shall we sustain the air of mystery that beckons us forth?”
Before he could respond, she stepped forward and enveloped him in a warm hug. “Look at you! You’ve grown so big! The last time I saw you, you were half this size!”
Eddie couldn’t help but laugh, the tension evaporating like mist in the morning sun. “I’m still the same old me, just a bit taller.”
“How unkind of thee to let slip the memory of your beloved aunt!” she teased, giving him a mock pout as she stepped back to assess him with a playful glint in her eyes.
As Catherine stepped back from the embrace, still chuckling at Eddie’s playful jab, the door to the apothecary swung open once more. In bounded Torrie, Eddie’s little sister, her curls bouncing with every step and her face alight with excitement.
“Catherine!” Torrie exclaimed, her voice full of delight as she practically launched herself into a hug.
“Well, well, if it isn’t my favourite niece!” Catherine announced with exaggerated flair, her light blue eyes twinkling with mischief. With a flourish, she spun Torrie around in a grand gesture before gently placing her back on the ground, tousling Torrie’s hair.
“You won’t believe it! I spotted Aunt Catherine’s carriage while I was heading home from Aella Academy!” Torrie jumped in, her excitement practically bubbling over. “So I caught a lift! Catherine totally said I could!”
“Torrie!” Eddie let out an exasperated groan, pinching the bridge of his nose. “You really shouldn’t—”
“And I totally did!” Torrie wrapped things up with a victorious grin. “Catherine even told me what to get for snacks later!” She made a face at Eddie, sticking her tongue out before sprinting towards the back room, her laughter echoing in the air behind her. “I’ll stash them in the kitchen!”
Catherine let out a laugh, her head shaking in disbelief. “She’s got more energy than a fire-breathing dragon on a rampage.”
Just as Eddie was about to respond, the door swung open once more, unveiling Mr. and Mrs. Welton.
Mrs. Welton’s eyes sparkled with delight at the sight of Catherine. “Catherine!” she called out, her voice filled with warmth and affection as she rushed forward to wrap her in a loving embrace.
Mrs. Welton stepped back, “You appear to have hardly aged a day, just as ever.” It’s utterly infuriating.
“That’s exactly why you hold the title of my favourite younger sister,” Catherine replied, her smile full of mischief. “I daresay you carry your seventy years with a grace that surpasses anyone I have ever encountered.”
Mrs. Welton rolled her eyes good-naturedly. “Flattery will get you nowhere, Cathy.”
“Oh, it always brought me treats when we were young,” Catherine replied with a playful tone.
As the two women shared their laughter, Mr. Welton drew near to Catherine, a grin spreading across his face. “Ah, Catherine! Still as keen as ever, I see.”
“And yet, here you are, still on your feet.” Catherine smiled, “It seems that alchemy is working its magic on your joints, Robert.” Catherine remarked with a playful lift of her eyebrow.
Mr. Welton chuckled. “Or maybe I’m just that stubborn.”
“Oh, do not be so humble. You were truly one of my most unforgettable apprentices,” Catherine remarked, a playful glint in her eye. “I recall the time you mishandled that levitation potion, almost sending the cauldron soaring through the ceiling.” She crossed her arms and fixed him with a pointed gaze, yet the corners of her mouth betrayed her with the hint of a smile. “And don’t think for a moment that I’m unaware you did it intentionally to catch Alyssa’s attention.”
Mr. Welton feigned innocence, shrugging his shoulders in mock surrender. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Oh, please.” Catherine rolled her eyes. “You orchestrated the explosion with such precision that she would come rushing to our aid. And do you know who had to clean up the mess afterward? Me!”
Mrs. Welton chuckled softly, her hand delicately covering her mouth. “Hold on, is that the reason the cauldron found itself lodged halfway into the ceiling?” I had always believed it to be merely one of his typical, awkward instances.”
“I had to make sure she noticed me somehow,” Mr. Welton admitted with a sheepish grin. “And it worked, didn’t it, Alyssa?” He glanced at Mrs. Welton, his expression softening.
“It did,” she confessed, a gentle smile gracing her lips. “Yet, you felt it necessary to explode the brewing room to capture my notice.”
Catherine let out a huff, though it was more amused than irritated. “You used me as your unwitting accomplice in your courtship shenanigans. The nerve!” She shook her head dramatically. “I should’ve charged you extra for those lessons.”
“And yet,” Mr. Welton said, his grin widening, “you still wrote me a glowing recommendation to the guild after I finished.”
Catherine waved a dismissive hand, though a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. “Only because I felt sorry for Alyssa. I figured she deserved a husband who could at least brew a half-decent potion without destroying half the brewing room.”
The playful banter between them drew laughter from Mrs. Welton, who nudged Catherine lightly. “Admit it, you’re proud of him. He turned out alright in the end.”
“Proud?” Catherine exclaimed with feigned outrage. “I felt a wave of relief wash over me at the thought of not having to contend with him once he had graduated. You cannot fathom the countless moments I wished to transform him into a fish and set him free in the vast ocean.”
The room filled with lighthearted laughter, the bonds of friendship and family weaving together like the strands of a well-crafted spell. For Eddie, watching them interact felt like a reminder of the strength that came from those connections—something he didn’t often realize he needed.
At that moment, the apothecary felt alive with magic—not just the kind bottled on shelves, but the kind that lingered in shared memories and warm embraces.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 21 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie pushed forward, the golden glow of the Eden Flowers fading behind him as he crossed into the dark embrace of the Illusory Forest. His breath came fast, his pulse hammering in his ears. The rifle weighed heavy in his hands, but he barely noticed. He had no time to think—only to run.
The forest closed around him, thick with gnarled roots and twisting branches that reached for him like grasping fingers. Overgrown bushes snagged at his coat, thorns scraping against his skin, but he didn’t stop. Every rustling leaf, every whisper of movement sent a fresh jolt of fear through his spine.
Catherine was in here. Somewhere.
The Nightingale Dragon was in here.
A branch snapped behind him. Eddie spun, rifle raised, heart hammering against his ribs. Nothing. Just the shadows shifting, the wind curling through the trees. He swallowed hard, forcing himself to keep moving.
Then—movement to his right.
Eddie whirled, pulling the hammer of his flintlock back with a sharp click, aiming into the darkness.
Something was there.
A shape, barely visible through the gloom, shifting between the trees. Then, it stepped forward into the faint sliver of moonlight.
It’s an owl. At least, it looked like one. White-feathered, round-faced, black eyes reflecting the dim light. Eddie exhaled sharply, lowering the rifle slightly.
Then the owl turned its head. Further than it should have. Tilting it in an unnatural, unsettling way.
Eddie’s grip tightened on the rifle. The creature blinked at him, and only then did he see its body in full—a pair of powerful, feathered forelimbs pressing into the earth, another set of taloned hind legs shifting beneath its weight. It wasn’t perched on a branch. It was standing.
It was the size of a horse.
Eddie stood frozen, his pulse thundering in his ears. A shudder crawled down his spine, but he forced himself to refocus. The fear clawing at his chest wouldn’t help Catherine. He had to keep moving.
Then, where the owl-beast had stood, he saw it.
A white column, fractured and ancient, standing among the tangled roots. A ruin, half-buried in time.
He was close.
Steeling himself, Eddie pressed on, deeper into the dark.
His breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The rifle felt heavier in his hands now, the weight dragging at his arms, but he didn’t slow. The ruins had to mean something—he was getting close.
Then, through the shifting shadows of the forest, he saw it. Another column. Stark white, fractured by time, rising from the tangle of roots.
He ran past it, his boots crunching over fallen leaves.
Another column.
Eddie’s brow furrowed. His mind struggled to place it. Had there been two? Had he miscounted?
He kept moving, branches clawing at his sleeves, the whisper of unseen creatures brushing past his ears. His pace quickened, his pulse hammering as the trees thinned for a brief moment—
And another column loomed ahead.
Eddie’s stomach twisted. He was sure now. The jagged break along its top, the way the roots coiled around its base—
It was the same column.
He sucked in a breath, pushing forward despite the tight knot of unease forming in his chest. Maybe if he just kept moving. Maybe if he ran faster—
Another column.
Eddie’s steps faltered. His hands clenched into fists. The realization crawled under his skin like ice.
“Damn it!” The word ripped from his throat as he hurled the rifle to the ground, the impact kicking up dirt and dead leaves. His vision blurred with frustration, his pulse a roar in his ears. He dropped to his knees, fingers curling into fists as he punched the earth. Once. Twice.
The ground beneath him did not yield. The forest did not shift. The column still stood.
His chest heaved as he gritted his teeth, hands trembling against the damp soil. His breath came ragged, his thoughts spiraling.
He was alone.
And if he didn’t find a way out soon—
So will Catherine.
Eddie curled in on himself, his breath slowing as the weight of frustration settled over him. His fingers pressed into the damp earth, cold and unyielding beneath his touch. He had no plan. No way forward. No way out.
Then, something caught his eye—a glint of silver against his chest. It was his ring.
It still hung from its chain, resting against his collarbone. A simple thing, jade set in silver, smooth and worn from years of absentminded touch. He reached up and unhooked the chain, pulling the ring free. It felt heavier than he remembered.
How long had he carried this? 
He turned it over in his palm, the jade catching the faintest traces of light that slipped through the trees. He had always known it was more than just an heirloom. It was a conduit—a stable and powerful one, more reliable than any wand or staff he had ever held. He had used it before. Back in the academy.
His lips parted slightly at the thought, a memory unfurling like a page turning in his mind. He could see himself hunched over workbenches, vials bubbling, chalk scratched across slate. The endless nights spent refining formulas, the competitions that drove him forward, testing himself against others in his pursuit of alchemy.
One of those competitions had taken him to Edenfield.
He had left Weshaven for the first time, stepping into a city far grander, far more modern than his home. Weshaven was small, familiar, a town of fishermen and merchants. But Edenfield—Edenfield was different. Towers rising against the sky, the weight of history pressing down upon its streets, magic humming in every stone.
He had stood there, a boy from a port town in the corner of the world, he promised himself— one day.
One day, he would get out of Weshaven. One day, he would make it to Edenfield. Not as a visitor. Not as an outsider. But as a student of its oldest academy.
A dry, bitter laugh escaped his lips.
What a stupid, naive dream.
He looked down at the ring again, still resting in his palm. The same as it had always been. The same size, the same weight.
Slowly, almost hesitantly, he slipped it onto his index finger.
It still fit.
The ring settled against his finger, a snug, familiar weight. Eddie flexed his hand, staring at it for a moment longer.
Then, something flickered in the corner of his eye.
A glow. Faint, but unmistakable.
Eddie stiffened, his breath catching in his throat. He turned his head, searching the darkness. There—just beyond the trees, past the twisted roots and shifting shadows—a golden shimmer pulsed, like the last light of a dying ember.
Without thinking, he reached for his rifle, brushing off the dirt before slinging it back over his shoulder. His boots crunched against the damp earth as he pushed forward, drawn toward the glow.
The forest twisted around him, branches stretching like skeletal fingers, the air thick with the scent of moss and damp leaves. The glow remained steady, leading him forward, past the pale columns that had mocked him only moments before.
And then, he saw it.
A single Eden Flower.
Eddie came to a halt, frowning. The golden petals glowed softly, swaying ever so slightly as if stirred by an unseen breeze. It stood alone, its light delicate yet defiant against the gloom of the Illusory Forest.
What the hell is it doing here?
Eden Flowers never grew alone.
He had seen them in thick clusters, blooming in vibrant patches along the gates of the forest and dotting the Traveller’s Path like fallen stars. They flourished in groups, never isolated. Never like this.
Eddie stared at the glowing flower, his mind racing.
Catherine had gone into the forest with a light.
A golden light.
Just like this one.
The thought struck him with a mix of excitement and doubt. It was stupid. It was ridiculous. But what if—what if Catherine had taken the glow of the Eden Flowers into the Illusory Forest to bypass its effects?
Eddie exhaled sharply. He had no other choice.
Slowly, he extended his hand—the one wearing the ring—and cupped the delicate flower. The golden glow spilled over his fingers, seeping into his skin like liquid light.
Then, something shifted.
The jade on his ring pulsed with a faint luminescence, a deep green glow blooming within the stone. The Eden Flower brightened in response, its golden light intensifying until it was nearly blinding.
Eddie's breath hitched.
Before he could comprehend what was happening, the light detached from the flower, gathering into a swirling, luminous orb in the palm of his hand.
He curled his fingers slightly, watching as the ball of light hovered weightlessly above his skin, pulsing like a steady heartbeat.
Eddie swallowed, turning back toward the looping white pillars. He had no proof this would work. No guarantee.
But it was worth a try.
He stepped forward, the golden light casting long, flickering shadows across the trees. His boots crunched over the earth, his heart hammering in his chest as he braced for the familiar sight—the same damn white column mocking him yet again.
Instead, a white stone sign stood before him.
Eddie stopped, his breath catching. He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the unexpected sight. The sign was carved with an inscription, the letters curling in an elegant, foreign script. He had broken free.
Eddie lifted his gaze, his chest tightening as he took in what lay ahead.
Beyond the sign, a ruin stretched before him—ancient, crumbling, swallowed by time and shadow. The air was thick with dust, and the scent of aged stone filled his lungs.
And then—
A deep, guttural roar split the silence.
The ground trembled. Somewhere within the ruins, stone collapsed in a thunderous crash.
Eddie’s pulse pounded in his ears. He took the rifle that was slinged on his back, and made his way into the ruins.
Catherine might be there.

            <Notes>Eddie’s rescue

Who wants what? Why can’t they have it

Who cares? What if they don’t get it?

Everyone cares, he cares, if he don’t do so, Catherine might be dead


What is the bad news?
Eddie was going on a loop

What is the good news?
Eddie spotted a single glowing Eden Flower, its flickering, he then took his ring, and captured its glow, using the glow to guide him into the ruins

2. Eddie passes a column

3. Eddie passes the column again, he is trapped in a loop

4. Eddie at first gave up, he has been going on forever, as he bow down, panting, he noticed, a slight glimmer of an Eden Flower,

He noticed that earlier, Catherine used the same glow on her staff

5. Eddie taking his ring off his pockets, reluctantly wearing it

            <Title>Chapter 12 V3</Title>
            <Text>The wooden creak and clacking of horse hoofs filled the journey after Eddie, Torrie, Markus and Catherine boarded the carriage that agreed to take them to Gunther’s Farm, that is the northernmost point the carriage is willing to take them.
Scents of hay and the faint earthy breeze drifting through the open sides of the carriage. Eddie sat quietly, his gaze fixed on the passing fields, The rifle sat leaning on his shoulder. Catherine, ever the scholar, kept stealing glances at the weapon. Finally, her curiosity got the better of her. 
Catherine then reaches her hand to touch one of the engravings.
But as usual, Eddie swatter her hands away.
“Come on, Edward.” Catherine sighed, “Can’t I get just a little touch of it?”
“No, Catherine.” Eddie reminded, “Dad said so.”
“Humph,” Catherine said in mock pout, “Have it your way then.”
Markus and Torrie laughed at the exchange, but Catherine is far from over, she continued,
&quot;But I've been meaning to ask about that flintlock of yours. It's not exactly what you see every day, especially for someone helping out at the apothecary.&quot; 
&quot;It's more of a hand-me-down, I guess,&quot; he sighed, &quot;Back when Weshaven was still full of Streamwyrms, Dad taught my brother Alfred how to use it. Alfred would go into the shore with the others and scare off anything too close to the Apothecary. Sometimes, he'd even shoot them if they were too bold.&quot; 
“Streamwyrms? What’s that?” Torrie asked,
“It’s those fishes coming out of the shores every August, remember? Sharp teeth, four legs, you were almost bitten by one last summer.”
“Oh those!” Torrie said, “But they are so cute, why did Alfred shoot them?”
“No they aren’t cute, Torrie, they’re pest!” Eddie hissed
Catherine tilted her head, her gaze flicking back to the rifle. &quot;And now? I assume there aren't any Streamwyrms around anymore.&quot; 
&quot;Not really,&quot; Eddie replied. &quot;They still comes out of the shores every August, since Alfred’s not around, I takes his place, but honestly Markus was much more better shot than me, so I haven't had to use this thing in ages. Honestly, it's just been collecting dust.&quot; 
&quot;So why bring it now?&quot; Catherine pressed, a note of curiosity creeping into her tone. 
“Eh,” Eddie shrugged. &quot;Because it's cool.&quot; 
“You just said that Robert asked you to take it.” Catherine said
“But it’s still cool nonetheless.”
“Since it’s oh so cool,” Catherine said theatrically, “You would let me touch them.”
“No!”

-o-

The carriage came to a slow, creaking halt in front of a farmstead, a modest property framed by sprawling fields and a weathered wooden fence. The farmhouse stood stoically against the horizon, its roof patched in places and its walls bearing the marks of years spent braving the elements. A few chickens scattered at the sound of the wheels stopping, clucking indignantly as the group prepared to step down.
The driver gave the reins a gentle flick. “Here we are. Gunther’s Farm. Northernmost point, just like I said.”
Eddie was the first to hop off, his boots crunching against the dirt path as he turned to help Torrie down. She leaped with an exaggerated flourish, as if pretending she were dismounting a noble steed. Markus followed, stretching his arms and squinting at the farm with mild curiosity. Catherine climbed down last, brushing her red coat off with an air of elegance—until the driver called out.
“Right, miss. That’ll be two silver for the lot of you.”
Catherine froze mid-motion, her hand lingering in her pocket as she turned to the driver with a sheepish smile. “Ah… I think…”
The driver looked more unamused.
“I… seem to have misplaced my coin satchel…” Catherine said, her voice uncharacteristically hesitant. She glanced back at the group. “Eddie, darling,” she said, flashing an overly sweet smile. “Be a dear and lend me a bit, would you?”
Eddie looked at Catherine, seemingly taken aback by her uncharastically sweet and regal tone.
“What.” Eddie said
“I misplaced my coin purse.”
“You spent all your coins didn’t you—“
“I said I misplaced it. Happens to the best of us, you know.” 
Eddie reluctantly dug into his pouch, fishing out two silver coins and handing them to the driver, who nodded in thanks and clicked his tongue to set the horses moving again.
As the carriage rolled away, Eddie turned to Catherine. “You’re a master alchemist, and you don’t have two silver to your name?”
“Exactly,” Catherine said, “Also I’m not just a Master Alchemist, Edward. I’m a Travelling Master Alchemist, and that is why I accepted that gig!.”
“I sometimes wonder how my younger self could even idolise you.“

            <Title>Chapter 9E</Title>
            <Text>&quot;Come on,&quot; Eddie snapped, his pace unwavering as he navigated the fractured pavement. &quot;Every minute we waste here is another minute she's with him.&quot; His eyes, sharp and restless, scanned the peeling shop signs, dismissing everything that wasn't their target.
&quot;Maybe if you slowed down for two seconds, you'd see that bloke with the knife tattoo sizing up your jacket,&quot; Ashley retorted, She kept her staff held tight against her side, a constant, worried presence. &quot;This place is dodgy as, Eddie. We can't just go charging in.&quot;
&quot;We don't have time for a scenic tour, Ash,&quot; he shot back, not breaking stride. &quot;Victoria's lead is the only thing we've got. We need to move.&quot;
&quot;And what good are we to Madeleine if we get jumped in an alley because you're too busy playing the hero to look where you're going?&quot;
&quot;Alright, alright, break it up, you two,&quot; Will cut in, stepping smoothly between them. His voice was a calm, mediating force. &quot;He's not sizing you up, Eddie. He's the lookout for that illegal potions den.&quot; Will gestured with his chin towards a cellar door shrouded in shadow. &quot;And Ash is right, you're walking like a target. Relax your shoulders.&quot;
Eddie shot him an irritated look, but subconsciously did as he was told.
&quot;Look,&quot; Will continued, his American accent casual but his eyes missing nothing. &quot;I get it. You're both right. We need to be fast, and we need to be smart. Lucky for you guys, I'm fluent in both.&quot; He gave them a half-smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. &quot;I know this turf. Food's cheap, information's cheaper if you know who to ask. Just follow my lead and try not to look like you're about to start a fight.&quot;
&quot;I'm not looking for a fight,&quot; Eddie muttered, his focus already back on the street ahead. &quot;Just answers.&quot;
&quot;Cool. Then let's find some,&quot; Will said, pointing them toward a narrower street choked with shadows. &quot;Victoria's file mentioned 'The Gilded Menagerie,' right? Super pretentious name. Sounds exactly like the kind of place a psycho would set up. Down this way, Blackwood Alley. It's quieter.&quot;
Eddie didn’t hesitate, following Will into the gloom of the alleyway without a backward glance. Ashley took a deep breath and plunged in after them, keeping close. The alley was a world unto itself. Stalls fashioned from scrap wood and tarps were crammed into every available nook, their proprietors watching with hooded, assessing eyes. The air was thick with the smells of strange spices, alchemical reagents, and unwashed bodies.
Will was in his element. He approached a woman mending a net woven from glowing, silvery thread. &quot;Evenin', Mara,&quot; he said with an easy nod. &quot;Slow night?&quot;
The woman grunted, not looking up from her work. &quot;Always is when the Wardens are sniffing around.&quot;
&quot;Tell me about it. Say, you ever hear of a place called 'The Gilded Menagerie'?&quot;
Her fingers stilled for a fraction of a second. &quot;Never.&quot; The word was flat and final.
&quot;Right on. Stay safe,&quot; Will said, already moving on. He didn't press. He led Eddie and Ashley past a stall selling what looked suspiciously like dragon's teeth, and stopped near a kid leaning against a wall, trying to light a damp cigarette with a sputtering fire-rune drawn on his thumbnail.
&quot;Yo,&quot; Will said. The kid looked up, wary. Will subtly held up a small coin between his thumb and forefinger. &quot;Gilded Menagerie. Pet shop. You know it?&quot;
The kid's eyes flickered to the coin, then down the alley. He gave a jerky nod toward the far end. &quot;Keep going. 'Til you hit the dead end with the wall mural of the kraken. It's the only door with a brass handle.&quot; He snatched the coin from Will's fingers and immediately turned his attention back to his cigarette, the conversation already over.
They followed his direction, the alley narrowing even further until it opened into a small, dead-end courtyard. A massive, faded mural of a kraken strangling a ship covered the entire back wall, its single painted eye seeming to watch them with ancient malevolence. And there, tucked away in the corner, was a single, unassuming storefront.
&quot;There it is,&quot; Eddie breathed, pulling Will and Ashley behind a stack of damp, discarded pallets across the narrow, cobbled alley. The air, thick with the smell of coal smoke and wet brick, had a distinct chill that had nothing to do with the weather.
From their hiding spot, &quot;The Gilded Menagerie&quot; looked even more pathetic. The paint, once probably a cheerful yellow, had peeled and flaked away to reveal the dark, soot-stained brick beneath.
&quot;Gilded? Looks more like rusted,&quot; Ashley whispered, her voice tight. &quot;This whole setup is seriously dodgy.&quot;
&quot;That's the point,&quot; Will murmured, his analytical gaze taking in the peeling paint and grimy windows. &quot;It looks forgotten. Old news. Best way to get people to ignore you is to look like you're not worth looking at.&quot;
Eddie's knuckles were white where he gripped the splintery wood of the pallet. &quot;I don't care what it looks like. Victoria's intel was solid. Madeleine's in there, we know it.&quot;
&quot;Okay, but we're not just kicking the door down,&quot; Ashley insisted, putting a hand on his arm. &quot;We need to see what we're walking into.&quot;
Nodding, Eddie took the lead. The three of them detached from the stack of pallets, melting into the deep shadows cast by the tall, narrow buildings. They used the slow passage of a man pushing a cart of scrap metal as moving cover before pressing themselves flat against the cold, damp brick beside the shop's large front window.
Heart pounding, Eddie cautiously peered through a clean patch on the glass.
The inside was just as gloomy as the exterior, filled with stacked cages and the low hum of an overworked air filter. A nervous-looking young man stood behind a counter, nodding deferentially. But it was the person he was talking to that made Eddie's blood run cold.
It can't be.
But it was. Professor Gareth Hudson stood there, his posture as rigid and commanding as ever. And he wasn't alone. As Eddie's shocked gaze widened, he took in the two figures flanking him. They were built like brick walls, their faces hard, impassive stone. Dressed in practical boots and plain blue fatigue jackets, they weren't just muscle; they looked like handlers. Soldiers. Their eyes were cold and constantly moving.
Eddie stumbled back from the window, his breath catching in a choked gasp. He collided with Ashley, who grabbed his arm to steady him.
&quot;Eddie, what is it? What did you see?&quot; she whispered urgently.
He stared at her, his eyes wide with a terror that went beyond simple fear. His suspicion had been a theory, an idea. This was real. This was a man he knew, a man who graded his papers, standing twenty feet away with what looked like a death squad.
&quot;Bloody hell,&quot; he finally managed to rasp, his voice tight with disbelief. &quot;It's him. Hudson. He's in there. He's right there.&quot;
The weight he put on those words sent a chill through both Will and Ashley. This wasn't the grim satisfaction of a hunch paying off; this was the shock of finding the devil himself waiting for you at the front door.
Will pulled him further into the shadows, his expression grim. &quot;Okay. Okay. New plan. Right now.&quot; He glanced at Ashley, who looked pale but resolute. &quot;Front door is out. No way. We're not fighting that.&quot;
His gaze flicked down the narrow, trash-strewn ginnel between the pet shop and the pub next door. &quot;There has to be a back way. A delivery entrance. Every shop in these alleys has one.&quot;
They circled the building, hugging the shadows where the damp brick met the slick, cobbled ground. The alley behind the pet shop was even more claustrophobic than the street out front—a narrow channel hemmed in by high walls, overflowing metal bins, and the sour smell of wet trash. A single, caged bulb cast a weak, yellow light over a heavy-set steel door. The back entrance.
Just as they took cover behind a large, dented dumpster, the steel door creaked open. A young, harried-looking employee stumbled out, dragging a heavy black rubbish bag. He didn't look around, his only goal to heave the bag into a bin before quickly retreating inside. The door swung shut with a heavy, final thud, the lock clicking into place with unnerving loudness in the quiet alley.
&quot;That's our chance,&quot; Eddie whispered, his voice taut. &quot;He won't be back for a while. Let's go.&quot;
The trio darted from behind the dumpster, their footsteps unnaturally loud on the wet ground. Eddie reached the door first, his focus absolute. &quot;Okay, stand back. I'll corrode the lock mechanism. Standard steel shouldn't take more than a few seconds.&quot;
He placed his hand over the lock, a faint green transmutation circle glowing to life around his knuckles. The air hummed as he focused, preparing to disintegrate the metal at a molecular level. But the moment his energy touched the lock, a sharp blue glyph flared to life on the steel's surface, repelling the green light with a fizzing crackle. Eddie yanked his hand back as if burned.
&quot;Damn it!&quot; he swore, cradling his stinging fingers. &quot;It's enchanted. Reinforced alloy. My alchemy can't get a purchase.&quot;
&quot;Then let me,&quot; Ashley said, stepping forward. There was no panic in her voice, only grim resolve. &quot;Some locks need a key. Others just need a better question.&quot;
She held her staff, the smooth, dark wood familiar in her hands. The silver crystal at its tip began to emit a soft, pulsing light. Closing her eyes for a second, she whispered something too low for the others to hear, her brow furrowed in concentration.
While she worked, Will acted as lookout. Anxious and needing a better vantage point, he clambered onto a sturdy-looking bin, craning his neck to peer through a high, grimy window that looked into the main shop.
Ashley touched the glowing crystal to the keyhole. Instead of a physical tool, shimmering tendrils of silver light flowed from the crystal and into the lock, feeling for the magical wards woven within the metal. The process was silent, demanding absolute focus.
&quot;Guys, we need to hurry this up,&quot; Will hissed down from his perch.
&quot;She's working on it!&quot; Eddie snapped back in a harsh whisper, his eyes fixed on Ashley's strained face.
&quot;No, I mean hurry up,&quot; Will repeated, his voice dropping with urgency. &quot;Hudson's on the move. The clerk is leading him through a door behind the counter. They're heading for the back rooms.&quot;
The ticking clock was no longer abstract. It was the sound of footsteps approaching from the other side of the wall.
Ashley's breath hitched, a bead of sweat tracing a path down her temple. The silver light from her staff flared. There was a soft chime as the first ward broke, then another. The blue glyph on the lock flickered violently. She pushed harder, her knuckles white.
&quot;Almost there...&quot; she gritted out.
From inside, muffled but drawing nearer, they could hear the low murmur of Hudson's voice.
With a final, sharp click that was both magical and mechanical, the blue glyph died. The lock was open.
Ashley sagged against the door, exhausted but triumphant. &quot;It's done.&quot;
Eddie didn't hesitate. He grabbed the handle, pulled the heavy door open just enough for them to slip through, and plunged them into the darkness within, pulling the door silently shut just as the sound of footsteps stopped right outside the interior entrance to the room they were now in.

            <Title>Chapter 22 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie moved cautiously through the ruins, his footsteps echoing in the vast emptiness. The shattered remains of Craemonia Bastion stretched before him—toppled columns, cracked stone archways, and walls worn down by time and nature. The air was thick with dust, the scent of damp stone mingling with the crisp night breeze.
His eyes scanned the remnants of what must have once been a grand stronghold, now reduced to a skeletal shadow of its former self. What was this place? A fortress? A sanctuary? Or perhaps something more?
Then—
BAM.
An explosion shattered the stillness.
The force of it sent a shockwave through the ruins, shaking loose dust and debris. Eddie flinched as a cloud of smoke and stone erupted from a collapsed section of the bastion, somewhere ahead. His pulse quickened.
Through the smoke and chaos, a figure sprang backward.
The figure soared through the air, their long coat billowing around them as if caught in an unseen current. The air itself seemed to hold their weight, slowing their descent in an effortless glide. Eddie, still at the edge of the bastion, stood frozen, watching the scene unfold.
At first, he struggled to recognize the figure through the dust and shifting shadows. But then—there was no mistaking it.
It was Catherine.
She landed smoothly, feet skimming the fractured stone as she turned to face her opponent. Her brass-mahogany staff was held at her side, her stance relaxed.
And then—
From the ruins of the observatory, it emerged, at first a shadow… then a silhouette.
Then it’s Nightingale Dragon.
The ancient sentinel of the Illusory Forest loomed over the shattered laboratory, its obsidian-black scales gleaming under the fractured moonlight. Its six pairs of glowing red eyes, locked onto Catherine with an almost calculating gaze.
The beast let out a slow, reverberating growl.
A blur of black scales and outstretched talons shot toward Catherine with terrifying speed. She pivoted on her heel, barely dodging as the beast’s claws raked across the stone where she had stood moments before, carving deep gashes into the earth.
Catherine retaliated. She hurled a jagged slab of stone toward the dragon, transmuting it mid-air into a hail of sharp-edged weapons—spears of iron, serrated daggers, bolts of steel. They shot forward like an arrow storm, striking the dragon’s gleaming black scales.
But they bounced off. The weapons clattered uselessly to the ground, failing to pierce the dragon’s obsidian-like scales. The beast barely flinched, its thick armor impenetrable.
The dragon lunged again.
She ducked, rolling across the rubble-strewn ground as its talons slammed into the stone behind her, sending shards flying. She flung another boulder, transmuting it into a cascade of jagged spikes, but the dragon merely twisted its body, letting the shards shatter harmlessly against its scales.
Nothing was working.
The dragon’s eyes gleamed. And then—
It reared back. Its chest expanded.
Catherine’s instincts screamed at her. Something was coming.
The dragon’s maw opened, and with a deep, reverberating roar—it breathed.
A storm erupted from its throat, a deathly blizzard that roared forward in a freezing, unnatural wind. Everything in its path was consumed by frost. The shattered ruins, the broken pillars, even the very air seemed to crystallize, turning into jagged ice.
Catherine dove aside just in time, feeling the air turn bitterly cold as the icy storm sliced through the ruins of the bastion. The place she had stood just seconds before was now a frozen landscape of sharp, glistening spires.
She couldn’t keep dodging forever.
Catherine’s eyes darted across the ruins. Then—there.
The remnants of a massive hearth stood at the center of the bastion, its stone structure still intact. Scattered around it were splintered remains of old, dry wood.
The dragon snapped its head toward her, locking onto its prey. Its chest expanded again.
Another breath was coming.
The dragon reared back—and unleashed its full power.
A blizzard howled toward Catherine, spiraling forward like a spear of frozen death.
And then—
A roar of fire storms forth from Catherine’s staff.
The hearth ignited, the remnants of wood transmuting into a raging inferno. She lifted her staff and with a forceful swing, she commanded the flames forward.
Her fire storm met the dragon’s blizzard.
The two forces collided in a blinding clash of elements—searing heat against freezing cold.
The ground shook beneath the sheer power of their battle. Flames and frost spiraled into the air, twisting and crackling as the two energies fought for dominance. Sparks and embers rained down, steam and mist billowing across the battlefield.
For a moment, neither force relented.
A grand stalemate.
Eddie stood frozen at the edge of the ruins, the clash of fire and ice raging before him.
Catherine and the Nightingale Dragon were locked in a deadly stalemate, their powers grinding against each other in a battle of extremes.
The dragon’s ice breath roared forward like a storm, its jagged frost spreading across the ground, creeping closer. Catherine’s fire lashed back, searing the air, steam and mist billowing into the night sky.
Neither side was winning.
Eddie’s mind raced. There was no way around the dragon, not in these ruins, not in this confined space where every collapsed wall and broken archway became another obstacle.
The monstrous creature loomed, half-shrouded in shadows, its six pairs of glowing red eyes cutting through the darkness like burning coals. The air was thick with the stench of burning and the sting of cold, a suffocating mix of heat and frost.
His pulse pounded in his ears. His breath came fast, rugged bursts. His body trembled.
His thoughts scattered, crashing into each other. Panic lawed at him.
Then, something flickered inside him. A memory—sharp, vivid.
The boy he used to be.
Fearless. Reckless. Always the first to act before thinking.
That boy hadn’t hesitated. That boy had thrown himself headfirst into chaos.
Eddie clenched his jaw. He could feel it again—the reckless bravery, the stubborn impulse to do something, anything.
What would the old me have done? Eddie thought to himself.
He knew the answer. He had always knew the answer.
He would’ve done something stupid.
He took a deep breath—and raised his rifle.
The weight of it settled in his hands. The polished wood, the cold metal, the faint scent of gunpowder. His grip was steady. His heart was not.
The hammer clicked back, the metallic rasp slicing through the roaring battlefield.
He took aim.
Then—he shouted.
“HEY!”
The word ripped from his throat, sharp and defiant.
The Nightingale Dragon turned.
Catherine’s eyes snapped toward him.
For the briefest second, everything stopped.
The beast’s gaze locked onto him, its six glowing eyes narrowing in eerie unison. 
Eddie exhaled—and pulled the trigger.
A deafening crack.
The rifle kicked back hard, slamming against his shoulder. His arm screamed in protest, but the shot had already torn through the air, a streak of fire and metal racing toward its target.
The bullet struck home.
A wet, sickening crack.
The creature’s head jerked violently to the side as the round punched into one of its glowing red eyes.
A splatter of fluid and shattered bone burst from the wound, painting the ruins in streaks of glowing red ichor.
The Nightingale Dragon screamed. It roared in pain.
A wretched, soul-piercing roar of agony and rage tore through the air. The beast’s entire body convulsed, its spine arching as it thrashed against the ruins.
Massive claws scraped the stone floor, carving deep gouges into the rock. Cracks splintered across the ancient ground.
The dragon clawed at its face, its remaining eyes flickering wildly in pain. Blood poured from the ruined socket, dripping onto the cold earth.
It screeched, stumbling back, its massive wings flaring as it flailed in a blind frenzy.
The stalemate was broken. Eddie ran.

-o-

The ruins blurred around him—shattered ruins, burning embers, frost creeping over stone. The Nightingale Dragon howled in agony behind him, its monstrous body writhing, claws tearing at its ruined eye. But Eddie didn’t stop to look back.
Catherine stood near the crumbling hearth, her brass-mahogany staff still clutched in her hands, breath heaving from the clash of fire and ice.
Eddie skidded to a stop beside her, grabbing her arm.
“We have to go,” he snapped, shaking her slightly. “The Traveller’s Path—now!”
But Catherine didn’t move.
Instead, she rounded on him, anger flashing in her eyes. “How foolish can you be?!”
Eddie blinked. “Excuse me—what?”
“You shouldn’t have come!” she shoved his hand away. “I’ve got it under control!”
“Under control?!” Eddie shot back. “Are you fucking serious? That thing nearly killed you!”
“I know what I’m doing, Edward!” Catherine growled. “I don’t need your help! Now get back to the Traveller’s Path!”
“I’m not leaving without you! Especially with that thing around!”
“I am not leaving without the Codex.”
Eddie’s frustration boiled over. “You are not seriously risking your life over a damn book!”
“It’s not just a book!” Catherine’s voice rose, her grip tightening on her staff. “The fate of magical education—”
BOOM.
A deep, thunderous tremor rocked the ruins.
Both of them froze.
The Nightingale Dragon let out an ear-splitting roar, its entire body seizing with fury. Blackened wings flared wide, broken stone and debris raining from above.
Its tail lashed out.
Neither of them saw it coming.
CRACK.
A split second of weightlessness—then impact.
The world lurched sideways. Eddie collided hard with the stone wall, the breath ripping from his lungs. Pain exploded through his back and shoulder. His vision blurred, dark spots dancing at the edges of his sight.
The ringing in his ears drowned out everything else.
For a moment, he couldn’t move.
Then—he forced himself to look up.
His rifle lay in pieces a few feet away, the wooden stock snapped clean in two, the barrel twisted and broken beyond repair.
His stomach sank.
He turned—Catherine lay crumpled a few feet away, her staff clattering to the ground.
Eddie’s pulse spiked in fear. He dragged himself forward, his entire body protesting the movement. He reached her, grabbed her shoulders, shook her.
“Catherine,” he rasped. “Are you alright?”
No response.
</Text>
            <Notes>Eddie had arrived at Craemonia Bastion, the battle could be heard from the laboratory,

And then BAM

The walls of the laboratory burst open, and from it, Catherine sprang backwards, air currents elevating her and slowed her descent 

Her stance relaxed as she faces off The Nightingale Dragon

From the ruins of the observatory, the dragon emerges


It lunges towards Catherine, Catherine dodges, hurling pieces of rocks, metals and transmuting them into weapons, 

Eddie watched all of this fear palpable, describe his fear

He took a deep breath and shouted, &quot;Hey!&quot; 

Catherine surprised, Dragon is also surprised

Eddie took a shot the dragon is in agony

Eddie rushes towards Catherine, 

But Catherine is angry, saying that Eddie is stupid for going after her, Eddie said that she is stupid going here in the first place

Eddie is taking Catherine back, but Catherine argued, she is not leaving without the Codex

Eddie and Catherine argued back and forth

Until finally

The Dragon went berserk, its tail hits Eddie and Catherine into a wall

Catherine fell unconcious</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 18 OLD</Title>
            <Text>The moonlight pierced through the dense canopy of the Deep Glaive, casting jagged patterns across the forest floor. Twisted vines and ancient trees loomed like sentinels, their gnarled forms seeming almost alive in the shifting light. The forest was oppressively silent, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant, haunting call of some unseen creature. 

Markus walked behind Catherine, his grip tight on Eddie’s flintlock rifle. The weapon was raised, its polished barrel glinting faintly in the pale light. Every whisper of movement sent his heart racing, his eyes darting toward every shadow. At the slightest rustle of a bush, the rifle twitched in his hands, his finger hovering dangerously close to the trigger. 

Catherine could hear the weapon rattling and flinging around, her staff resting lightly in her grip. Her expression was calm but sharp. She noticed Markus’s shoulders hunched, his steps jerky and uncertain, and the tension in his grip on the rifle. The unease was palpable, and the oppressive atmosphere was clearly getting to him. 

“Markus,” she said softly, breaking the silence with an even tone, “you’re holding that thing like we’re about to be ambushed by an army of bandits.” 

Markus shot her a glance, his voice tense. “Feels like we might be. This place... it’s not normal. I feel like something’s watching us.” He turned sharply at another rustling sound, aiming the rifle toward the underbrush. It was just a gust of wind stirring the leaves. 

Catherine stopped for a moment, letting her staff tap the ground lightly. “You’re going to give yourself a heart attack before we even find the Artefact.” She smiled, trying to inject a bit of levity. “Besides, I don’t think Eddie would appreciate you wasting all his precious gunpowder on small critters.” 

Markus lowered the rifle but kept it ready. “Easy for you to joke, ma’am! You’ve got magic if something happens. I’ve got only this—and it’s not exactly comforting.” He gave the rifle a wary look as if it might betray him at any moment. 

She stepped closer, her voice quiet but steady. “We’ll be fine. I’ve been through worse, believe me. And I promise you won’t be facing it alone if anything comes at us.” 

Markus glanced at her, the tension in his jaw easing slightly. “Alright,” he muttered. “But I’m still keeping this thing ready.” 



They continued deeper into the forest. The oppressive silence seemed to press in even closer, the darkness growing thicker. Catherine kept her senses sharp, but she made a mental note to keep talking—it seemed to keep Markus from completely unravelling. 

“You know,” she began, her tone conversational, “I used to visit Eddie’s home a lot when he was younger. We’d go adventuring in old ruins, exploring caves and abandoned barns. I thought I was pretty brave back then. But this? An illusory forest with who-knows-what lurking around? A first for me.” 

Markus glanced at her, his face pale. “Really? That must have been something.” 

Catherine nodded with a reminiscent smile. “It was. Eddie used to love going off-trail, never sticking to the safe paths. He was always adventurous, seeking new experiences, no matter the danger. We’d found ourselves in trouble countless times, but Eddie always seemed to enjoy the thrill of it. His older brother Alfred and I often had to help him out of those scrapes.” 

Markus swallowed hard, his nerves evident. “Eddie... he seems different now. He doesn’t seem like the same person.” 

Catherine’s smile faded slightly as she looked at Markus. “Different? How so?” 

Markus took a deep breath, his voice trembling slightly. “Well, there’s a reason for that. Back at the academy, a kid named Davies heavily bullied me. I wasn’t as adept at magic as the others, so I was an easy target. Eddie was always my friend because he didn’t quite fit in. He’d spend time with me instead of those other guys.” 

Markus paused, his eyes reflecting the dim light. “One day, when Davies was particularly brutal, Eddie was there. He was impulsive, as he always was, and he challenged Davies to a duel. None of us knew how it would end. Davies didn’t take Eddie seriously, but during the duel, Eddie accidentally scarred Davies’ face. It was a mess, and Eddie got expelled from the academy.” 

Catherine’s expression shifted from curiosity to shock and sympathy. “I had no idea. Eddie never spoke about it in detail. I’ve always wondered why he seemed so distant.” 

Markus nodded, his gaze dropping. “It was a turning point for him. He became cold and withdrawn after that. It’s like he lost something important to him.” 

Catherine sighed, her heart heavy with the weight of newfound understanding. “I wish I had known. I might have been able to help him see past it and rekindle his love for magic. I hope that’s still possible.” 

-o-


The path twisted and narrowed. The forest thinned, giving way to crumbling stone walls and scattered debris. The air here was heavier, carrying the faint scent of ash and decay. Moonlight spilt over the ruined town. It illuminates the jagged remnants of stone buildings. Their once-proud facades were now draped in thick vines and cloaked with moss. Trees had long since claimed the poor town as their own, their roots snaking through cobblestone streets and bursting through walls as if nature had conspired to erase the city from history. 

Markus abruptly stopped, his grip tightening on the flintlock rifle. His gaze landed on a charred wooden sign half-buried in the dirt. The faint, scorched lettering read: Welcome to Groville. 

“Welcome, huh?” Markus muttered uneasily, his voice barely above a whisper. “Doesn’t feel very welcoming to me.” He scanned the empty streets, rifle raised slightly as if the shadows themselves might lunge at them. 

Catherine stepped ahead, her staff brushing against the stones as she moved. She didn’t seem as unnerved, but her eyes lingered on the sign. “Groville,” she said softly, almost reverently. “It’s hard to believe people lived here once.” 

Markus’s voice was tense. “Yeah, well, they’re not living here now, are they? I don’t like this place, Catherine. It’s... too quiet.” 

The eerie silence hung around them. Broken only by the occasional creak of a distant tree branch. The wind stirred, rustling the overgrown foliage that consumed the ruins. As they walked deeper into the town, Markus flinched at every noise, his rifle sweeping toward a sound that turned out to be nothing more than a rat skittering across the stones or a bird startled from its perch. 

The road narrowed into what might have once been a central square. It is now dominated by the looming remains of a cathedral. Though cracked and leaning, its towering spire still pierced the night sky, defiant against centuries of decay. The grand stone arches of the cathedral’s facade were blanketed in moss, while a massive oak tree had burst through the centre of the structure, its gnarled branches reaching outward like skeletal arms. 

Markus stopped at the threshold, the rifle raised again. “You’re sure this is where we need to be?” he asked, his voice edged with scepticism and discomfort. 

Catherine nodded, her eyes fixed on the ruin. “This is the place. The Artefact should be inside.” She paused, then added, “If it’s still here.” 

Markus groaned, lowering the rifle enough to look at her. “If it’s still here? Great. We came all this way for a maybe.” 

Catherine smirked faintly. “Not just a maybe. A once-in-a-lifetime, maybe. There’s a difference.” 

Markus shook his head, muttering under his breath as he adjusted his grip on the rifle. “This place gives me the creeps. Let’s grab what you need and get out of here.” 

As they stepped inside the cathedral, the temperature seemed to drop. Their footsteps echoed on the cracked stone floor, and the vast emptiness swallowed the sound. Stained glass windows, long shattered, cast fragmented patterns of moonlight onto the ground. Vines and roots wove through the walls, blending the sacred and the wild. 

The lectern stood on a pedestal at the heart of the cathedral. Bathed in silvery moonlight streaming through the shattered roof. Twisting roots coiled around the base as if the great oak tree was trying to claim it as its own. Resting atop the lectern was the Artefact—an ancient, ornate relic, its surface etched with runes that seemed to pulse faintly with an otherworldly glow. 

Catherine’s breath hitched as she stepped closer, her eyes fixed on the Artefact. “There it is,” she whispered, her voice reverent. “One of the Nine Sages must have used this. It’s incredible…” 

Markus, standing a few paces behind her, shifted uncomfortably. His grip on the flintlock rifle was so tight that his knuckles had turned white. The oppressive silence of the cathedral pressed down on him, broken only by the faint rustle of leaves in the wind. He scanned the dark corners of the ruins, his unease growing by the second. 

“I don’t know about this, ma’am,” Markus muttered, his voice strained. “It’s getting late, and the forest feels... different. Like it’s watching us.” 

Catherine didn’t look back; she focused entirely on the Artefact. “We’re almost there. Just a bit further,” she said, brushing off his concerns with her hand. 

Markus took a shaky step forward, his boots crunching against the debris of the stained glass on the ground. The tension in the air seemed to thicken with each passing moment. The rifle wavered slightly in his hands as sweat beaded on his forehead. He could feel his pulse pounding in his ears. 

“Catherine, I—” Markus began, his voice faltering. 

He froze mid-sentence. A low, rumbling growl echoed through the cavernous cathedral. Reverberating between the broken walls and twisted roots. The sound was deep, guttural, and far too close. Markus’s breath caught as he turned his head toward the source. 

His eyes widened in terror. Something massive shifted from the shadows near the back of the cathedral. A pair of glowing eyes pierced the darkness, their unnatural light casting faint reflections on the stone floor. 

“Ma’am?” Markus said, barely above a whisper, “Something’s here.” 

Catherine, still fixated on the Artefact, took another step forward. “Just a bit closer,” she murmured as if in a trance. “We need to—” 

“Look out!” Markus’s voice broke into a panicked shout. 

The creature emerged from the shadows with a feral roar. The faint light of the moon illuminated its massive frame, and the ground seemed to tremble beneath its weight. 

Markus raised the flintlock rifle. His hands shook as he aimed at the beast. His breath is ragged. His heart was racing as he squeezed the trigger. 

A thunderous crack shattered the tension. The muzzle flash lit up the cathedral for the briefest moment. Illuminating Catherine’s stunned face and the creature’s feral snarl.

            <Title>Chapter 6E V2</Title>
            <Text>Dawn painted the common room in stripes of gold and shadow, revealing the aftermath of their all-night crusade. Eddie blinked awake to the scent of burnt toast and the sight of Will's socked foot inches from his face. The quilt Henry had lent them—a garish thing stitched from what appeared to be old theater curtains—had somehow wound up entirely around Ashley, leaving Eddie and Will to share a single threadbare throw pillow.
Across the room, Christine occupied the entire sofa like a sleeping monarch, her silk sleeping mask slightly askew to reveal the dark circles beneath. Geralt's massive frame was folded improbably into an armchair, his neck bent at an angle that promised hours of chiropractic regret. The four stolen telephones sat like sentinels on the coffee table, their cords tangled in a nest of crossed-out names and coffee rings.
Four stolen telephones sat like battle trophies on the low table, their cords tangled in a nest of crossed-out names and ink stains. A half-eaten pastry served as a paperweight for Ashley's meticulously organized lists: Edenfield Students (34), Fernwynn Merchants (12), Dockworkers (7). Someone—probably Will—had doodled obscene illustrations in the margins of the university directory. 
The scent of honey and toasted wheat pulled Eddie from sleep like an alchemist's hook. Through the sleep-crusted haze, he saw Catherine's silhouette against the dawn-lit kitchen window—her knife-sharp ears backlit by morning sun, her hands moving with the rhythmic precision of someone who'd cooked this meal for centuries. A lilting melody curled through the air, its melody shifting between languages Eddie half-recognized from childhood lullabies.
Eddie's bare feet met cold flagstones as he shuffled toward the kitchen. The others slept on—Will sprawled like a fallen knight across two chairs, Ashley curled protectively around her staff, even Christine's usually-perfect posture slackened against Geralt's shoulder. The war room of crumpled lists and tangled phone cords seemed almost peaceful in the honey-gold light.
Catherine flipped a pancake with a flick of her wrist, the thin disc catching air before landing back in the skillet with a buttery hiss. &quot;Good morning, sleepyhead,&quot; she sang, not turning from the stove. The ancient tune she'd been humming dissolved into modern speech. &quot;Or should I say good afternoon?&quot;
Eddie leaned against the counter, watching as she arranged the pancakes on a chipped platter. They were unlike any he'd seen—translucent as parchment, their edges crisp and blistered from olive oil. Bowls of figs split open like jewels, salty olives, and something that looked suspiciously like goat milk cheese completed the spread.
&quot;Elven legionnaire's breakfast,&quot; Catherine said, pressing a fig into Eddie's hand before he could ask. The fruit burst sweet and floral against his tongue. &quot;Sustained many a campaign in the old days.&quot; Her eyes flicked to the sleeping figures, the makeshift command center of their rebellion. &quot;I see you've amassed an army.&quot;
Eddie followed her gaze to where Henry's quilt still held the shape of his body. &quot;More like desperate volunteers,&quot; he muttered.
Catherine's smirk deepened as she drizzled honey in spirals across the pancakes. &quot;All great lords start with banners called from kitchen tables.&quot; She tapped the knife against the platter—a soft chime that somehow carried through the room. 
The honey spirals glistened like molten gold as Eddie took his first bite. The flavors exploded—earthy wheat, floral olive oil, the sharp tang of aged cheese cutting through the sweetness. It was delicious, which made the historical irony almost funny. The legendary Elven Legionnaire's rations, perfected during their conquest of the mortal kingdoms, now served in a university dorm to their former enemies' descendant.
Eddie watched dawn light catch in the honey still dripping from Catherine's fingers—golden and sticky as the secrets she kept.
Catherine’s knife stilled mid-slice when Eddie spoke. &quot;You brought us to the Weltons.&quot; Figs bled dark juice onto the cutting board. &quot;But who gave us to you?&quot;
Catherine hummed—a neutral sound that wasn't quite confirmation. The cast iron skillet hissed as she slid another pancake onto the growing stack.
Eddie pressed on. &quot;My magic... it's not just different from the others. It's old. Hereditary.&quot; His thumb unconsciously traced the strange sigil his spells sometimes left behind—the one Madeleine had called &quot;the language of stones.&quot; &quot;Who were my parents?&quot;
For a long moment, the only sounds were the crackling stove and distant snores from the common room. Catherine arranged figs on the platter with deliberate care before speaking.
&quot;Your father,&quot; she said at last, &quot;was the most honorable man I ever knew. Kept his vows even when it cost him everything.&quot; She drizzled more honey, the golden threads forming intricate patterns. &quot;Your mother... she could shield an entire city with her will alone.&quot; A pause. &quot;Neither of them would recognize this world now.&quot;
Eddie's chest tightened. &quot;That's not an answer.&quot;
&quot;It's the only one I can give.&quot; Catherine finally met his gaze, her pupils slitted against the morning light. &quot;When the time comes, you'll know.”
Eddie hesitated, then picked up a fork and cut into the pancake. He took a cautious bite, his taste buds immediately met with a surprising mix of sweetness from the honey, tang from the curdled milk, and the subtle richness of olive oil. He blinked, taking another bite.
“Not bad,” he admitted, nodding. “Actually… pretty good.”
“Ha! Told you,” Catherine said, turning back to the stove with a triumphant smile. She gestured to a bottle of red wine on the counter, its label faded and its glass dusty with age. “Pair it with this. Vintage Solivian wine.”
Eddie frowned, glancing at the bottle. “Wine? For breakfast?”
Catherine shrugged, her smirk widening. “You’re students. Isn’t drinking at odd hours part of the experience? and this one is a vintage from... let’s see... ah, ninty years ago,” Catherine said with a sly smile. “I thought it might pair nicely, i might have forgotten where i got this from.”
“Ninty years,” Eddie repeated, shaking his head. “That’s older than my grandfather.”
“Your grandfather was eighty years old, Edward, but alas,” Catherine winked. “Good wine only gets better with age. Like myself.”
Eddie rolled his eyes but couldn’t help chuckling. “You’re absolutly insufferable.”
“And you’re welcome,” Catherine shot back. “Now go wake the others. Breakfast doesn’t keep, and I’m not reheating it.”
The common room buzzed to life as Eddie nudged Will and Ashley awake. Blankets rustled, groggy complaints filled the air, and the aroma of Catherine’s cooking wafted through the space, coaxing everyone into consciousness.
“What... smells so good?” Will muttered, rubbing his eyes as he sat up.
“Breakfast,” Eddie said simply, gesturing toward the kitchen where Catherine was now arranging the spread. The dining table had been transformed into a miniature feast, with plates of Legionnare Ration, bowls of figs, dates, and olives, and a decanter of the vintage red wine sitting at the center. Everything was placed with precision, as though Catherine were hosting an important gathering rather than feeding a group of university students.

-o-

Dorm Seven's dining table—usually home to dust and the occasional forgotten textbook—gleamed under an uncharacteristic arrangement of chipped plates and mismatched cutlery. Henry kept adjusting the placement of a fork, his dorm captain instincts warring with disbelief that his residents were actually using the common area for its intended purpose.
Christine's teacup hovered halfway to her lips, her usual aristocratic poise shattered as she stared openly at Catherine. The morning light caught the elf's sharp cheekbones and the subtle points of her ears, making her seem more like a storybook illustration than a being of flesh and blood.
&quot;You're... you're really one of them,&quot; Christine breathed, her voice uncharacteristically small. &quot;The Fair Folk of the Silver Courts.&quot;
Catherine's smirk deepened as she drizzled honey over a pancake with theatrical flair. &quot;Oh, we had many names. The Shining Bane. The Dawn Bringers. The Heartless Conquerors.&quot; She leaned forward, her eyes glinting. &quot;Which bedtime stories did your nurses tell, little lordling?&quot;
A flush crept up Christine's neck. At her side, Geralt shifted protectively, his massive frame making the chair creak in protest.
Will snorted into his wine glass. &quot;Careful, princess. She'll have you trading your firstborn for a pretty song.&quot;
&quot;Already got one of those, thanks,&quot; Catherine quipped, ruffling Eddie's hair as she passed. He batted her hand away with a grumble, but there was no real heat in it.
Ashley, ever the diplomat, cleared her throat. &quot;The pancakes are incredible, Catherine. Is this really what elven legionnaires ate?&quot;
&quot;Only on good days,&quot; Catherine said, pouring more wine—into proper glasses now, much to Henry's visible relief. &quot;Mostly we survived on hardtack and spite.&quot; She winked at Christine. &quot;The 'fair lords and maidens' nonsense came later, when bards needed romantic endings.&quot;
Eddie watched as Christine carefully cut her pancake into perfect squares—a nervous habit he recognized from their academy days. The heiress who'd once mocked him for his &quot;peasant magic&quot; now sat starstruck before an actual mythical being. The irony wasn't lost on him.
&quot;So,&quot; Catherine's voice cut through the clatter of cutlery, her fingers steepled beneath her chin. &quot;This rebellion of yours. Do you children actually intend to storm the Black Hand's underworld den?&quot; Her tone walked the line between amusement and genuine concern.
Eddie set down his fork with deliberate calm. &quot;We're going to try.&quot; He nudged a grease-stained notebook across the table—pages crammed with phone numbers, each crossed out after last night's desperate calls. &quot;We've already started gathering others who've lost people.&quot;
Ashley leaned forward, her Campus Watch badge glinting beside a syrup smear. &quot;There's a meeting tonight. Midnight at the Edenfield Archives.&quot; Her gaze locked onto Catherine's with uncharacteristic intensity. &quot;You should come.&quot;
The room seemed to hold its breath. Even Christine stopped mutilating her breakfast.
Catherine swirled her wine, watching the legs slide down the glass. &quot;The Archives,&quot; she mused. &quot;Clever. No one would question students there after dark.&quot; A slow smile spread across her face. &quot;Even if they're planning treason.&quot;
Henry choked on his coffee. &quot;We're not—&quot;
&quot;Please,&quot; Catherine waved him off. &quot;Storming a secret assassin stronghold? That's textbook treason.&quot; She took a satisfied sip before adding, &quot;Deliciously so.&quot;
Will slammed his palms on the table, making the plates jump. &quot;So you're in then?&quot;
All eyes turned to the elf. Outside, a gust of wind rattled the windows—or perhaps it was the university's ancient ghosts stirring in anticipation.
Catherine's smile turned razor-sharp. &quot;Well, I haven't committed proper treason since the Solivian Uprising.&quot; She topped up her wine glass with a flourish. &quot;Wouldn't miss it for the world.&quot;

            <Title>Chapter 6E_V2</Title>
            <Text>The campus at midnight was a place transformed. The chatter of daytime was gone, replaced by a stillness that carried weight. Only the hush of wind slipping between the old stone halls, the rhythm of footfalls on cobbled paths, and the occasional chirr of crickets dared to interrupt the silence. Every now and then, distant laughter or the murmur of conversation drifted from windows still lit—last-minute crammers, night owls, or lovers defying curfew.
Eddie walked with his hands in his coat pockets, his steps steady now, no longer leaning on a crutch. His leg still ached if he pushed it, but he’d healed enough to walk without help. The cool night air bit through his collar, but he didn’t mind it. It kept him sharp.
Will strolled beside him, guitar slung casually over one shoulder. He must’ve come straight from a late-night practice in the Bardry building—his fingers were inked with fresh rune smudges and the faint scent of burnt sage clung to him.
“Hey, c’mon Ed!” Will said, nudging Eddie with his elbow. “You haven’t told us how’d the date go!”
“I told you, Will.” Eddie gave him a look. “It wasn’t a date.”
Will raised both brows like that proved his point. “Oh yeah? A stroll through the sanctuary, just the two of you, lingering stares across carnivorous beasts—classic not-a-date behavior.”
“Look- mate.” Eddie sighed, rubbing his eyes, “Madeleine called me for a reason, alright? She’s just called me because she needed to make sure of something.”
A third voice joined in from the other side.
“Uh-huh, is it making sure you’re compatible,” Ashley said sweetly, falling into step with them. She was fresh from the Witchcraft building, her long sleeves pushed up to the elbows and a faint shimmer of spelllight still clinging to her hair.
Eddie groaned. “Not you too.”
Ashley grinned. “What? I’m just saying. Mutual trust is important in a relationship. And you cannot get that if you haven’t had a stroll with just the two of you.”
“I will turn both of you into bronze statues, if you both don’t shut up.” Eddie hissed.
They continued down the stone path toward the library, the laughter slowly ebbing as the towering structure came into view, casting long shadows under the moonlight.
“So,” Ashley said, turning slightly toward Eddie. “All jokes aside… why is Claire calling us to an emergency meeting at the library? Did you guys do something?”
“No?” Will said, before giving Eddie a look. “Ed... you didn’t steal another restricted book from the library, did you?”
“No I didn’t.” Eddie blinked. “Well, Borrow. And technically, it wasn’t even restricted. Just adjacent to restricted.”
“You’re literally in a society called The Book Pirates,” Ashley said. “That’s the entire point of your society’s existence. Claire’s gonna wring your neck one of these days.”
“We’re not stealing books,” Eddie said indignantly. “We borrow them. Then copy them. Then return them. It’s preservation for the sake of equal chances of education!”
“It’s copyright violation,” Ashley said, smirking. “With a side of probable expulsion.”
Eddie grumbled, pulling his coat tighter as they rounded the last bend toward the library courtyard. “We’ve never been caught.”
Will clapped him on the back. “Well, if this meeting’s an ambush, it’s been an honor.”
As they reached the great oak doors of Edenfield Library, Eddie slowed his pace, his eyes catching something on the windowsill through the heavy curtains. The small wooden sign hanging crookedly on the handle read: CLOSED. The curtains were drawn tight, veiling the warm glow inside.
Ashley stepped forward, squinting at the row of books laid out along the windowsill—each color-coded like a secret language. “There,” she said, pointing. “Red cover…”
Will exchanged a quick glance with Eddie. “Red means…” he began.
“Emergency,” Eddie finished quietly.
A sudden hush fell over them. The easy banter faded, replaced by a tightening knot of unease.
The heavy library doors swung open, and the trio stepped inside. Their footsteps echoed in the vast, dim space, where rows of towering shelves loomed like silent sentinels. Near the back, under the soft glow of a hanging lantern, Claire paced restlessly along the stone floor.
Her usual calm, composed demeanor was nowhere to be found. Instead, she looked tense and unsettled, her brow furrowed deeply as she ran her hands through her hair. The quiet efficiency that Eddie and the others had always admired was replaced by hurried, anxious movements.
Eddie approached cautiously. “Claire?” His voice was low, careful. “What’s going on? Are you alright?”
Claire stopped pacing, taking a shaky breath before speaking. Her voice trembled slightly, heavy with urgency and something close to panic. “It’s Madeleine… someone’s been following her. She called me earlier, but the signal broke— I couldn’t reach her again. I… I should have done more. I should’ve protected her.” Her eyes flickered with guilt, her hands clenched into fists. “I think she’s been taken.”
Ashley moved quickly to Claire’s side, gently guiding her to sit on a nearby bench. “It’s not your fault, Claire,” she said softly, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.
But dread had already begun to settle in Eddie’s chest. The shadows around them seemed to grow heavier, and a cold weight pressed down on his thoughts. This was no ordinary emergency. Something far worse was unfolding.

            <Text>A distant hum—soft and steady, like an old air conditioner—merged with the rhythmic clicking of shoes on tile. He heard voices, muffled and layered, as though spoken through thick wool. a low drawl. a gentler cadence. a sharper interjections. Their words tangled just beyond his grasp, brushing the edges of understanding. Somewhere nearby, silk rustled faintly, and the soft clink of glass met the clatter of a tray being moved. The air was cool against his skin, and magic thrummed faintly beneath it all, like the heartbeat of the building itself. 
Eddie stirred awake. Blinking against the soft fluorescent light that streamed through the stained-glass panels above. he found himself in a spacious, vibrant ward he didn’t recognise. The light cast warm yellow hues across the room. It refracts off the intricate stained-glass windows. 
His body felt heavy, like he was sinking into the plush mattress beneath him. He shifted slightly—and a sharp bolt of pain shot up his left leg. He hissed through his teeth and stilled, his breath catching. A dull, throbbing ache pulsed just above the knee. The leg was stiff, wrapped in layers of linen and propped up slightly under the blankets. He could smell the faint, herbal scent of salves clinging to the cloth. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose hospital robe. 
He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the attack.
Voices filtered through the silk curtain beside him.
“…Come on, I’m just saying, there’s no freakin’ way it was some wasted dude with a pitchfork,” came Ashley’s voice, “He was, like, ten minutes from the East Gate. No way some random stumbles that close to campus without getting flagged.”
A deeper voice joined in—measured, steady. “When I found him,” said Henry, “There was someone nearby. Or something that looked like someone.” A short pause, and then, firmer: “But it wasn’t an actual person. Not really. Something about the way it moved... it wasn’t right.” 
Ashley then turned to Madeleine, “Madeleine, you’re the creature nerd here—what do you think? Something’s off, right?” 
“I’m not sure,” said Madeleine gently. “The shape of the wounds—it's not consistent with a  pitchfork. They’re jagged, uneven… it’s like when your cat scratch you, but worse.”
Ashley let out a dry laugh. “Okay, well, that must’ve been one seriously pissed-off cat to make that wound.” 
“Hang on a minute,” Will said, voice low and serious, leaning forward like he was letting them in on something. “You reckon it was a creature? That’d track. I mean—think about it. If it was, the police’d have to log it, send word to the Council, all that red tape. But they didn’t. They buried it. I think they don’t want folks panicking. Wouldn’t be the first time they swept something under the rug—what with all those curfew notices and whispers about things prowling after dark.”
Ashley snorted. “Here we go—Detective Will’s back on the case. Next thing you know, you’ll be drawing red strings in your dorm room.”
“I’m just saying,” Will continued, “We’ve been here long enough. And we know the police don’t spin that hard unless someone told ’em to. Higher up.”
There was a pause. Eddie kept his breathing steady, not quite ready to let them know he was awake.
“I saw it with my own eyes,” Henry said, his voice low and steady. “It looked like a man. Walked like one too. But something was off—uncanny. That’s not an animal attack. Whatever it was... it wasn’t just some beast.” 
Another pause.
“But you really think they’d put that in the official report?” Will said, brows furrowed. “They’ve been brushing this under for months. First it’s missing pets—brushed off as strays. Then the whispers about Red Oak Lane, alleys folk avoid after sundown. Come on. Anyone with half a brain can see something’s not right.” 
“—And now Edward.” Madeleine’s voice softened. “He could’ve died.”
Eddie blinked slowly, then let out a low groan. The talking stopped instantly.
“He’s awake,” Madeleine said gently, and he heard the shift of feet as someone moved to his bedside.
The curtain drew back, and light spilled across his bed. Madeleine stood closest, her auburn hair catching the light. Will gave him a lopsided grin from beside her, while Ashley crossed her arms and gave him a look that was half-relief, half-scolding.
“Eddie!” Ashley said, shaking her head with a grin, “Dude, you gotta stop getting yourself wrecked if you wanna survive first year. Like, seriously.” 
“I—I didn’t…” Eddie’s voice cracked. He coughed. His throat felt raw. “What happened?”
“We were rather hoping you’d be the one to fill us in,” Will said, his brow slightly knit. 
“Henry told us that you were found unconscious outside the Astral Garden, unconscious,” Madeleine explained, voice soothing. “Your wounds were… severe. They said it was a pitchfork, but—”
“—But like, no random dude’s just strollin’ around Edenfield with a pitchfork like it’s Halloween or something,” Ashley cut in. 
Eddie groaned and shifted upright, wincing at the pull in his bandaged side. “It was some drunk dude, Ash,” he muttered, his voice hoarse. “Or… at least, I thought so.”
Will stepped forward, his tone steady but earnest. “Eddie, you can trust us, mate. Whatever you remember—just say it. We’re not about to go blabbing it around.” 
She glanced at the others—Madeleine, Will, even Henry—waiting for their confirmation. One by one, they nodded.
Eddie hesitated. The memory a blur in his mind, sharp and confusing. But one detail glared, undeniable.
“I could’ve sworn it was a person,” he said slowly. “Not some monster. I saw them, just for a second. A silhouette. Tall. Human. Moving weird, but definitely a person.”
The words had barely left his mouth when Madeleine stiffened.
“A person?” she repeated, her voice a pitch higher than usual. “You’re sure? Not an animal?”
Eddie frowned at her reaction. Madeleine, normally so composed—always the calm in any storm—suddenly looked pale. Her fingers clutched the hem of her sleeve.
“I mean—yeah,” he said, uncertain. “It looked like one. Didn’t see a face or anything.”
“Did it use something to hurt you?”
Ashley raised her hand with exaggerated enthusiasm. “So wait—hold up—are we saying it was a pitchfork attack? Like, straight-up horror movie stuff?”
Will rolled his eyes. “Ash, for the love of god, can you not?”
Eddie let out a breath, then leaned back against the pillows, eyes distant. “I didn’t think much of it at first,” he said, voice low. “It was almost two in the morning. I’d just left the library—I’d stayed late copying a book for Alchemy. The campus was dead quiet.”
Everyone watched him now. Even Claire had paused her quiet page-turning.
“I was walking past the Archway Garden,” Eddie continued, “and I saw someone just… standing there. Under one of the old gaslamps. Alone. Wearing a suit, just—still. Like a statue.”
Will frowned. “A suit?”
Eddie nodded. “Dark-colored. Didn’t look like a student. Or a professor. Just this tall guy. I thought maybe he was lost. Or drunk. I kept walking.”
His voice dropped. “Then I heard footsteps. Behind me. Slow. Limping.”
A hush fell over the group.
“I turned onto Fallow Lane—the one behind the Rune Studies hall,” he said. “And that’s when I saw it again. It was following me. Limping like its leg was twisted or broken. That’s when I started running.”
Madeleine’s hand covered her mouth.
“I didn’t look back until I crossed into the courtyard behind Alchemy Hall. I thought I’d lost it. But when I turned…” Eddie swallowed. “It wasn’t standing anymore.”
He looked up at them. “It was walking on all fours. Like—like a dog. Except it was still wearing the suit. Its arms were too long. And its face…” He blinked, the memory flickering behind his eyes. “Its face wasn’t right. The eyes were too far apart. The skin looked stretched. Like it was trying to look human, but couldn’t quite manage it.”
Silence.
Just stunned stillness.
Eddie looked between them, the weight of the memory clinging to his chest. “Any idea what that might be?”
For a moment, no one moved.
Then Will leaned forward, brows furrowed. “Could it be a Ghoul? Or, like… some kind of Undead?”
Henry let out a sharp breath through his nose. “Don’t be ridiculous.” He crossed his arms. “Ghouls don’t wander into cities. They stick to old battlefields or ancient ruins. There hasn’t been a proper Undead sighting in Solivia for decades.”
Ashley rested her chin in her hand. “Well, what about vampires?” she teased, smirking. “Or, ooh—maybe a werewolf. Full moon’s just around the corner.”
Will rolled his eyes. “Ash, come on. There’s no vamps or werewolves in Edenfield. If there were, the Ministry would’ve locked the city down yesterday.”
Madeleine opened her mouth slightly, but hesitated—her brows pinched, clearly thinking.
Henry noticed. “Madeleine,” he said gently, “You’ve got something, don’t you?”
She glanced at Eddie, then back to the others. “Maybe,” she murmured. “I… I don’t know for sure, but…” Her voice dropped. “What Eddie described… the way it moved, how it looked almost human before it—shifted…”
She paused again, then finally said it.
“…It sounded like the behaviour of a Chimaera.”
The word lingered in the air.
Silence fell. Will rubbed the back of his neck, eyes narrowed in thought. Henry crossed his arms, staring at the floor as if trying to piece together something unspoken.
“Whoa wait,” Ashley broke the quiet. “Hold up. What even is a Chimaera?”
Madeleine’s expression turned grave. “It’s not just one thing,” she said softly. “Chimaera is a classification. They’re creatures made through… unnatural means. Some through forbidden magic, others through a process called Alchemical Grafting.”
Ashley blinked. “Grafting, like plants?”
“Kind of,” Madeleine said, her tone tight. “But instead of branches and vines, you’re stitching together flesh. Tendons. Bones. Sometimes even minds. It’s a practice skirting the edge of necromancy—closer to that than real alchemy.”
Henry’s brow furrowed. “And you're sure that's what this was?”
Madeleine hesitated for a moment, then took a slow breath, like she was bracing herself.
“Last semester, the Sanctuary received a creature,” she said, her voice lower now, almost like she was telling a ghost story around a fire. “It was found by a Paladin unit stationed just outside the city walls. Whatever it was, it was barely alive. Mangled. Scarred. And… wrong. Its body didn’t match any known species—nothing from the Catalogue of Mythical Creatures. Nothing from the Sanctuary’s archives. It had human teeth. Reptilian skin. Its lungs… clicked when it breathed.”
“Ew…” Ashley shivered. “Gross.”
“The researchers tried everything. Scans. Genetic matching. Even magical tracing,” Madeleine continued, her voice hushed. “But it didn’t belong to anything in our world. Eventually, they gave up. The only category that fit was Chimaera—a man-made thing, spliced from gods-know-what.”
Will leaned forward. “What happened to it?”
“It died,” she said, simply. “Didn’t survive the month. Screamed the entire last night it was alive. Then just… stopped.”
No one spoke.
The air in the infirmary had gone still again.
Madeleine finally turned to Henry, her voice more measured now. “I’m not saying I’m a hundred percent sure. But from what I saw… from what I tried to nurse last semester…” She paused, searching for the right words. “It really sounded like a Chimaera. The way it moved. The way Eddie described its body—those inconsistencies.” She shook her head slightly. “It’s only a hypothesis. That’s all.”
Henry didn’t respond at first. His jaw tightened, and his eyes dropped to the floor as if something was beginning to click into place. Slowly, deliberately, he looked back up at her.
“…If that’s true,” he said, his voice low, like he didn’t want the words to be real, “then that means…”
“Someone succeeded in creating it,” Madeleine said quietly. “And if what Eddie saw was true…” Her gaze slid toward Eddie, then returned to Henry. “…Then not just once. But twice.”
Eddie sat up straighter, his breath catching. His mind raced—not with fear, but recognition.
“You’re kidding,” he murmured.
But Madeleine wasn’t smiling.
Then, softly but with a rare note of resolve, Madeleine said, “We have to do something about this.”
She looked around the circle of friends, her brows slightly drawn, eyes steady. For a moment, her usual softness was edged with something almost fierce.
Before anyone could respond, the curtain snapped open with a rustle of silk.
A nurse in pale blue robes stepped in, smiling politely. “Sorry to interrupt. Visiting hours for Mr. Welton are over. The doctor will be in shortly for his examination.”
The group broke from their huddle. Ashley stood first, flashing Eddie a crooked smile as she bumped his shoulder lightly. “Alright, dude. Rest up, yeah? And maybe next time, don’t go picking fights with nightmare fuel without giving us a heads-up.” 
Will followed, his tone brisk but warm. “Keep your head clear, Ed. Rest, but don’t forget what happened. If someone’s covering this up—we’ll find out.”
Henry gave a brief nod, the hem of his coat brushing the polished floor. “Stay sharp, Edward. You’re lucky to be alive.”
Then came Madeleine. She stood near the foot of his bed, her expression softer now, though something lingered behind her eyes—concern, perhaps, or fear she wasn’t voicing.
As the others stepped out, she lingered.
“Hey,” she said, her voice quieter now that it was just the two of them. “Do you know when you’ll be out?”
Eddie shook his head. “Dunno. They said at least a week. Maybe two, if the burns need more time.”
Madeleine nodded slowly. Her fingers fidgeted with the sleeve of her robe.
She stepped closer and offered her hand again. He took it—and this time, she held it for a moment longer.
“Good luck,” she said. “And… stay safe, alright?”
Then she flashed him her familiar warm smile. The one that always seemed to smooth the edges of everything else. “When you’re out—come find me. There’s something I want to show you.”
With that, she waved gently and slipped through the curtain after the others.
Eddie leaned back against the pillows, the room quiet again save for the distant hum of magic.
It was only then that he noticed the slip of paper in his hand.
Neat handwriting curled across the page: Madeleine D. 0712 443 229And beneath it, a simple line:21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground.

            <Title>Chapter 1E V6</Title>
            <Text>A distant hum—soft and steady, like an old air conditioner—merged with the rhythmic clicking of shoes on tile. He heard voices, muffled and layered, as though spoken through thick wool. a low drawl. a gentler cadence. a sharper interjections. Their words tangled just beyond his grasp, brushing the edges of understanding. Somewhere nearby, silk rustled faintly, and the soft clink of glass met the clatter of a tray being moved. The air was cool against his skin, and magic thrummed faintly beneath it all, like the heartbeat of the building itself. 
Eddie stirred awake. Blinking against the soft fluorescent light that streamed through the stained-glass panels above. he found himself in a spacious, vibrant ward he didn’t recognise. The light cast warm yellow hues across the room. It refracts off the intricate stained-glass windows. 
His body felt heavy, like he was sinking into the plush mattress beneath him. He shifted slightly—and a sharp bolt of pain shot up his left leg. He hissed through his teeth and stilled, his breath catching. A dull, throbbing ache pulsed just above the knee. The leg was stiff, wrapped in layers of linen and propped up slightly under the blankets. He could smell the faint, herbal scent of salves clinging to the cloth. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose hospital robe. 
He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the attack.
Voices filtered through the silk curtain beside him.
“…Come on, I’m just saying, there’s no freakin’ way it was some wasted dude with a pitchfork,” came Ashley’s voice, “He was, like, ten minutes from the East Gate. No way some random stumbles that close to campus without getting flagged.”
A deeper voice joined in—measured, steady. “When I found him,” said Henry, “There was someone nearby. Or something that looked like someone.” A short pause, and then, firmer: “But it wasn’t an actual person. Not really. Something about the way it moved... it wasn’t right.” 
Ashley then turned to Madeleine, “Madeleine, you’re the creature nerd here—what do you think? Something’s off, right?” 
“I’m not sure,” said Madeleine gently. “The shape of the wounds—it's not consistent with a  pitchfork. They’re jagged, uneven… it’s like when your cat scratch you, but worse.”
Ashley let out a dry laugh. “Okay, well, that must’ve been one seriously pissed-off cat to make that wound.” 
“Hang on a minute,” Will said, voice low and serious, leaning forward like he was letting them in on something. “You reckon it was a creature? That’d track. I mean—think about it. If it was, the police’d have to log it, send word to the Council, all that red tape. But they didn’t. They buried it. I think they don’t want folks panicking. Wouldn’t be the first time they swept something under the rug—what with all those curfew notices and whispers about things prowling after dark.”
Ashley snorted. “Here we go—Detective Will’s back on the case. Next thing you know, you’ll be drawing red strings in your dorm room.”
“I’m just saying,” Will continued, “We’ve been here long enough. And we know the police don’t spin that hard unless someone told ’em to. Higher up.”
There was a pause. Eddie kept his breathing steady, not quite ready to let them know he was awake.
“I saw it with my own eyes,” Henry said, his voice low and steady. “It looked like a man. Walked like one too. But something was off—uncanny. That’s not an animal attack. Whatever it was... it wasn’t just some beast.” 
Another pause.
“But you really think they’d put that in the official report?” Will said, brows furrowed. “They’ve been brushing this under for months. First it’s missing pets—brushed off as strays. Then the whispers about Red Oak Lane, alleys folk avoid after sundown. Come on. Anyone with half a brain can see something’s not right.” 
“—And now Edward.” Madeleine’s voice softened. “He could’ve died.”
Eddie blinked slowly, then let out a low groan. The talking stopped instantly.
“He’s awake,” Madeleine said gently, and he heard the shift of feet as someone moved to his bedside.
The curtain drew back, and light spilled across his bed. Madeleine stood closest, her auburn hair catching the light. Will gave him a lopsided grin from beside her, while Ashley crossed her arms and gave him a look that was half-relief, half-scolding.

            <Text>The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by her son's room's oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 
A flicker of unease settled in her chest. Frowning, she turned the handle and pushed the door open.
The scent of the sea breeze drifted in, mingling with the familiar aroma of parchment and faint traces of potion ingredients. But something was... wrong.
Her eyes swept across the room, and for a moment, she didn’t register it. Then, it struck her all at once.
The bed—perfectly made. Not a single blanket thrown askew, no haphazard pile of pillows. The sheets were pulled tight, smooth as if untouched.
The desk—once a chaotic sprawl of open books, ink-stained papers, and forgotten potion vials—was orderly. Neat stacks replaced the usual clutter. The old alchemical texts, once left to gather dust, had been carefully arranged.
At the corner of the desk sat Eddie’s handmade radio. Its brass dials gleaming faintly in the morning light. The small headset, draped neatly over the side, emitted a soft, crackling hum. 
“…and over in Edenfield, clear skies and a bright, sunny day ahead…”
Her eyes moved to the window. It was open, letting the golden morning light pour in, warmly bathing the room. The soft murmur of the sea drifted in, accompanied by the cry of gulls. 
Eddie was gone, but not in the way he used to disappear into himself. This time, something had changed.
A soft smile tugged at the corners of her lips. Her heart swelled with quiet joy as she realised what had happened. Eddie had finally woken up—not just from sleep, but from the fog of despair that had weighed him down for seven years. He had tidied his room, made his bed, and left purposefully. The message, crystal clear, was silent. He was ready to move forward and re-engage with the world outside.
She stood there for a few moments longer, taking it in, feeling pride swell in her chest. Eddie, her boy, was finding his way again.
On the wall of his room, there is a new calendar, this one is clean, with no mark.
There is a circle on it.
5th of January, 1928.
It was today.
With a soft sigh of contentment. She shut the door behind her, allowing the room to be quiet. She turned and made her way downstairs, a little lighter on her feet, a little more at peace, knowing her son was beginning a new chapter.
She had a day to get on with—the apothecary to tend to, potions to brew, customers to assist—but everything seemed just a little brighter now. Eddie had woken up from his long slumber, and that was all she needed to know. 

-o-

Eddie stepped off the, flipping a few coins to the ferryman before pedalling his bicycle. 
The air here was different—crisper, drier. It lacked Weshaven’s thick briny scent, but in its place was something just as rich: the warm spice of freshly unloaded crates, the earthy tang of dried herbs, and the faint, papery whiff of parchment and ink as merchants tallied their stock.
Osthaven thrived with a different kind of energy. Where Weshaven had the steady, unhurried rhythm of fishermen gutting their morning’s catch, this place pulsed with movement and purpose. Dockhands hauled crates stamped with foreign sigils, couriers weaved effortlessly between carts, and merchants haggled over silk and spices from distant lands.
For the first time in a long while, Eddie felt something stir in his chest—not quite excitement, but something close. Possibility, maybe. A reminder that beyond everything he had left behind, there were still places to go, things to see, and new paths waiting to be taken.
Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the town humming with life around him. The salty breeze had faded, replaced by the warm aroma of fresh bread, sharp spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach grumbled in protest—breakfast had been rushed—but he barely noticed.
After scanning the street for the right building, he moved to sling his bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
Across the street, a building stood apart from the rest. Its stone walls bore the weight of age, but the towering columns remained proud, their intricate carvings unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, softened their edges, but their elegance endured—a testament to something greater than the years that had passed.
Above its heavy wooden doors, an emblem gleamed in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, its wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into a worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, a quiet stirring in his chest. He had never noticed it before—maybe he had never thought to look. But now, standing there, the emblem seemed to be looking back at him. Watching. Weighing.
His eyes traced the contours of the owl, its unblinking gaze steady, unwavering. It wasn’t just a place. It was a challenge. An invitation.
Eddie took a breath, gripping his handlebars a little tighter.
Alright, then. Let’s see what you’ve got.

-o-

The large double doors stood in front of him. Imposing yet inviting in a way only magical institutions could be. He took a deep breath and walked toward them, feeling the weight of the past and the future merge in that single step. The carved owl emblem seemed to watch his every move as if assessing whether he was ready for what lay inside.
This was the place where his life could change again.
Eddie walked through the heavy oak doors of the Sage’s Institute. Feeling a wave of warmth as the air changed from the busy streets of Central Weshaven to the quiet, scholarly atmosphere inside. The scent of old parchment and aged wood hit him immediately. A sense of academic grandeur wrapped in an almost mystical aura. His footsteps echoed across the polished stone floor. Runes, faintly glowing and humming with the wisdom of ages past, etched each tile.
In the centre of the reception hall stood a massive circular desk, staffed by clerks in deep blue robes. The space buzzed with quiet efficiency. The occasional murmur of conversation drifting through the grand chamber. Above the desk, a vast map of Solivia and the surrounding realms were etched into the stone wall. Golden pins mark various magical academies across the land.
Eddie’s gaze lingered, his eyes tracing the intricate pathways connecting cities. He recognised a few of the names.
Silverleaf University, nestled deep in the Forests of Hoverhill. It was reputed to be a haven for those who wished to blend magic with the natural world. Where the trees themselves seemed to hum with arcane energy.
Angelwood University, perched on the serene shores of Dill. Its ivory towers gleamed like pearls against the backdrop of crashing waves. A place where sea mages and weathercasters honed their craft.
Faraday University, on the rolling hills of King’s Grave. Surrounded by windswept fields and ancient stone monoliths. Known for its rigorous studies in enchantment and magical engineering. Solivia considered its graduates the finest spellwrights.
Finally, Eddie’s eyes landed on a pin in the heart of the Plains of Edenfield.
Edenfield University.
Unlike the other names, this one carried a weight that tugged at his chest. It wasn’t just another academy on the map. Edenfield was the dream, the pinnacle of magical education. It wasn’t a place for ordinary students—it was a place for the exceptional, for those destined to leave their mark on the world.
The golden pin glinted under the soft light as if beckoning him. Eddie swallowed hard, his fingers curling into his palms. A flicker of doubt crept into his mind. Did he belong there? Could he ever belong there?
The map whispered promises of possibility. A life beyond Weshaven and the confines of his father’s shop. But it also reminded him of the weight of expectations, of what it would mean to fail.
Eddie’s jaw tightened as he stepped back, shaking off the thoughts. His gaze lingered on the golden pin marking Edenfield University for a moment longer. Before he turned away, the image burned into his mind.
Eddie approached the desk, feeling out of place among the others, waiting. Some were dressed in elegant robes, and others carried enchanted scrolls. All seemed to radiate an air of confidence and purpose that Eddie wasn’t entirely sure he could fake.
One of the clerks, a middle-aged man. Spectacles perched on the edge of his nose and a weary yet meticulous expression. Glanced up from his parchment as Eddie hesitated in front of him.
“Yes?” the clerk prompted, his voice calm and measured. The single syllable was laden with impatience.
“Uh, hi,” Eddie began, forcing himself to sound steady. “I’m here about a scholarship to Edenfield.”
The clerk’s brow creased slightly. “A scholarship to Edenfield?” he repeated, setting down his quill with deliberate slowness. “You mean the Sage’s Institute sponsorship program?”
“That’s the one,“ Eddie said, trying to sound casual, though his hands clenched the edge of the desk.
The clerk’s expression flickered with doubt. He looked Eddie over, taking in the simple, slightly scuffed clothes and lack of discernible magical equipment. “I see. And you are... a registered applicant, I presume?“
“Not... exactly,“ Eddie admitted, heat rising to his cheeks. “But I—”
“Not registered.“ The clerk interrupted smoothly, his lips twitching into a faint, humourless smile. “Young man, the Sage’s Institute sponsorship is one of the most competitive programs in Solivia. Prestigious mentors typically nominated candidates or already have a record of exceptional performance. Forgive me, but you don’t quite seem...“ He gestured vaguely at Eddie, as if to say you don’t belong here. “...like the usual candidate profile.”
Eddie bristled, but swallowed his frustration. “Look, I don’t exactly scream ‘prodigy,‘ but I’m serious about this. I just—“
“Serious,“ the clerk echoed, his tone clipped as if he had heard this line a thousand times before. He picked up his quill again, his eyes drifting back to his parchment. “I’m afraid potential is rarely enough. Perhaps you’d like to review our admissions guidelines? And apply through the standard process—“
“But this isn’t standard,“ Eddie blurted, desperation creeping into his voice. “I have something—someone who’s vouching for me.”
The clerk gave him a sceptical glance over the rim of his spectacles. “Oh? And who might that be?”
Eddie hesitated. This was it. He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out the brass card Catherine had given him. The polished metal gleamed faintly under the reception hall’s magical lighting. He placed it on the desk with more confidence than he felt, sliding it toward the clerk.
“What’s this?“ the clerk asked, eyebrows raised as he reached for the card.
The clerk examined the card, his practised fingers turning it over. His face remained impassive until his eyes landed on the owl sigil of the Sage’s Institute. His brows furrowed slightly, but when his gaze flicked to the name and title engraved below, his demeanour shifted.
“Catherine,“ the clerk murmured, reading aloud. His tone carried an undertone of disbelief. His eyes darted back to the card.
Eddie nodded, unsure whether to feel proud or more intimidated by the weight of the name.
The clerk’s eyes snapped to Eddie, sharp and broad, like he had just seen a ghost. His mouth opened and closed wordlessly for a moment before he managed, “You mean this, Catherine? Is Catherine the Elf?“
Eddie nodded, shifting awkwardly under the man’s intense gaze.
For a heartbeat, the clerk stared at him. His earlier scepticism evaporated like mist under a scorching sun. He looked down at the card again, as if to confirm that it hadn’t somehow changed in the last few seconds. Then, straightening, he cleared his throat, visibly trying to compose himself.
“Well,“ the clerk said, his tone noticeably different now—more measured, almost reverent. “This is... highly unusual. Catherine the Elf does not give her endorsements lightly.”
He studied Eddie with a new, cautious intensity. Like a man reevaluating a puzzle he had underestimated. “Are you saying she’s vouching for you? Personally?”
Eddie nodded again, this time firmer, though the clerk’s disbelief lingered.
The man took a deep breath, his fingers tightening on the edge of the card. “Very well,“ he said at last, setting it down carefully as though it were made of glass. “Let me see what arrangements can be made.“
“Wait here for a moment,“ the clerk said, his voice now more measured. He disappeared through a doorway behind the desk. Leaving Eddie standing alone in the middle of the vast reception hall with his thoughts.
Eddie’s mind raced. He had no idea what Catherine’s influence truly meant in a place like this, and for a moment, he felt the weight of it all. This was a pivotal moment. If the card didn’t work, this whole attempt could fall apart. His gaze wandered around the room, taking in the portraits of past scholars watching him from the walls, their eyes following his every move. They were judging him, questioning whether he could walk the same halls they had.
Time seemed to stretch on as Eddie waited, the quiet hum of the Institute suddenly louder in the silence of his thoughts. His heart beat a little faster. He was on the precipice of something—he could feel it.
The door opened again, and the clerk returned, his expression now softened with respect. “Mr. Welton, if you would follow me, someone will speak with you shortly.”
Eddie nodded, tucking the card back into his pocket. He felt its slight weight as he followed the clerk deeper into the halls of the Sage’s Institute.
A girl in a deep blue robe approached him as Eddie stood there, waiting by the front desk. Her robe bore the emblem of the Sage’s Institute—a stylized owl perched on a scroll, its wings elegantly outstretched. She looked at Eddie with calm, appraising eyes before offering a slight nod.
“Edward Welton?“ she asked.
Eddie nodded.
“Come with me,“ she said, her voice steady but kind. “I’m Emma Somers. I’m the agent responsible for the Edenfield Scholars program.”
Eddie stepped beside her, feeling a mixture of nerves and anticipation. They walked silently for a moment before Emma led him to a spiralling staircase at the far side of the hall. As they began their ascent, Eddie glanced around. Taking in the intricate carvings on the bannisters—symbols of magic from all the schools he had once dreamed of mastering. The stairs spiralled upwards, the balustrade intricately carved with symbols of various schools of magic—Conjuration, Destruction, Alchemy, and more. Soft light from floating orbs illuminated their way, casting long shadows on the walls.
The stairs seemed to wind endlessly upward, and the air grew quieter as they ascended, the sounds of the busy reception hall fading into a soft hum below.
“First time going to the Sage’s Institute?“ Emma asked.
“Yeah, the place is huge for a magic academy,” Eddie said
“Indeed it is,“ Emma answered, “the Sage’s Institute is more than just a magical academy. Its roots go back centuries, to the time of the Nine Sages.“
Eddie’s eyes drifted to the portraits lining the walls as they ascended the winding staircase. He counted nine figures, each depicted with solemn dignity, their robes flowing like shadows that almost seemed alive. Each face held an ageless quality, their sharp eyes brimming with wisdom and quiet power. The intricate brushstrokes revealed an unmistakable Elven influence in the art.
“The Nine Sages,“ Emma said, noticing his gaze. Her voice was reverent as they climbed, “Were a band of scholars centuries ago. This was before the unification of magical academies. Back when magic was feared as much as it was revered. Their mission was to spread the knowledge of magic. Their mission was to guide, teach, and prevent the hoarding and misuse of magic, as had occurred during the Great Mages’ War.
Eddie slowed his steps, his eyes lingering on each portrait. “So... who were they, exactly?“ he asked, genuinely curious.
Emma smiled faintly, glancing back at him. “Each of them was a master in their own field, a visionary who shaped what magic is today. Caerwyn Eithrel—The Founder—is perhaps the most famous. He’s the one who envisioned a world where magic could be a bridge between peoples rather than a weapon. He authored the Codex Magicka, the very foundation of magical education. That’s him there,“ she added, gesturing to a tall, ethereal figure, his silver hair cascading like moonlight.
Eddie’s gaze shifted to the next portrait. A graceful figure with auburn hair crowned with woven herbs. “And her?“
“That’s Merrion Aelwyd—The Healer,“ Emma explained. “She travelled far and wide, healing the sick and teaching the arts of alchemical medicine. Her contributions to healing magic are unmatched even today. Her staff,“ she pointed to the depiction of the figure’s wooden staff. Sprouting with living vines “Is said to have grown from a sapling she saved during a storm.”
Emma motioned to the third figure, draped in a feathered cloak. Their hand rested on a staff intricately carved with what looked like constellations. “Talinor Rhydderch—The Explorer. They charted magical ley lines and discovered lost traditions. Thanks to them, we have portals and magical maps to navigate the arcane realm.”
With each Sage, Eddie found himself increasingly drawn to the stories, his curiosity mounting.
Emma continued to the next portrait row, “These three are the Mortal Men. Brython Gwalchmai—The Artist—used his art to make magic approachable. Inspiring countless people through performances and festivals. Edris Taranis—The Peacemaker—dedicated his life to uniting magical factions. And Loegrin Myrddin—The Philosopher. Penned the Ethics of Magic, which every Edenfield student must study.“
Eddie’s eyes settled on the last three figures, whose stout forms and powerful gazes set them apart.
“And these must be the Dwarves,“ he said.
“Exactly,“ Emma replied, nodding. “That’s Gerwald Eisenfaust—The Warrior—who balanced magic and martial skill to protect the weak. Sigmar Tiefenruh—The Protector—created the first magical vaults to safeguard dangerous artefacts. And Hildebrand Steindottir—The Innovator. Pushed the boundaries of enchantments, crafting the first magical prosthetics and automaton workers.”
Eddie stared at Hildebrand’s portrait, noticing the tools and gadgets painted with remarkable detail. He could almost feel the hum of innovation radiating from the canvas.
“The Nine Sages aren’t just history,“ Emma said softly, breaking his reverie. “They’re why places like Edenfield exist. Their ideals live on in studying, teaching, and using magic. They remind us that magic is a responsibility, not just a power.”
Eddie nodded, the weight of their legacy settling on him as they reached the top of the staircase. The winding steps had felt endless, but now they seemed to represent something else entirely. A journey not just of discovery, but of purpose.
“The Sage’s Institute was founded to carry on that mission,“ Emma said, glancing at Eddie as she spoke. “Our Scholarship program to places like Edenfield exists to ensure that the vision of the Nine Sages continues, even today. We’re not just looking for students with magical talent. We’re looking for those with the potential to carry on that legacy. To spread knowledge and contribute to the world of magic.”
Eddie took it all in, feeling the weight of the surrounding history. They passed under a large painting of the sages standing together before the High King. He felt renewed awe for the institution he was now a part of, even if he was still uncertain about his place there.
“You’ll see portraits of the sages throughout the Institute,“ Emma said. Gesturing to the figures on the wall. “They were instrumental in creating the very first magical universities. Edenfield was one of the first. Many magical traditions and practices we follow today derive from their teachings.“
They continued upward, the steps seeming endless. The further they went, the quieter the building became. The sounds of the bustling reception hall below faded into a deep, almost reverent silence.
Emma finally glanced over her shoulder at Eddie. “You’re lucky, you know,“ she said, her tone softening slightly. “Not everyone gets a recommendation like the one you have. Master Alchemist Catherine’s name holds a lot of weight here.”
Eddie didn’t quite know how to respond to that. He just nodded, gripping the card Catherine had given him tighter in his pocket.
As they entered the room labelled “Edenfield Office,“ Eddie felt a mix of anticipation and anxiety. Books and scrolls filled the shelves, and the scent of old parchment and ink hung heavy in the air. Emma sat behind a sturdy desk while Eddie sat across from her.
“Alright, Mr. Welton,“ Emma began, her tone sharp and professional. “I’ll add you to the list of Scholarship Applicants. But let me make something obvious.“ She fixed him with a steely gaze. “I know you’re connected to Master Alchemist Catherine, but that won’t mean a thing in this process. You’re not getting in just because of a connection. You will earn your place here on your own.”
Eddie swallowed hard, nodding slowly. “I understand.”
Emma continued, her voice unwavering. “You’re going on the entrance exam list. But unlike most applicants who have three months to prepare, you have three weeks. Three weeks to prove that you’re worthy.”
His heart sank. “Three weeks? That’s… really tight.”
Emma’s expression remained cold, “Let’s discuss your path forward. What faculty do you intend to study in at Edenfield?”
Eddie hesitated, the weight of her gaze pressing down on him like a physical force. For a moment, he let his mind wander. Considering the options Emma had laid out earlier: Conjuration, Illusion, Bardry, Enchantments, Automaton Engineering, Alchemy. Each sounded enticing, brimming with possibilities.
Noticing his uncertainty, Emma leaned back in her chair, her tone matter-of-fact. “Let me make this simple for you. Each faculty focuses on a distinct branch of magic. Each has its own strengths and limitations. It’s important to choose something that aligns with both your abilities and interests.”
She began ticking them off on her fingers. “Conjuration is the art of summoning—objects or entities from the Arcane Realm. It’s powerful but dangerous if mishandled. Illusion is about perception and deception, manipulating what others see or believe. Bardry is resonance magic—using performance to amplify and harmonise magical or emotional forces. Enchantment emphasises imbuing objects with magical properties, giving them unique powers or functions.”
Her gaze sharpened. “Automaton Engineering combines mechanical ingenuity with enchantments, creating constructs and magical devices. It’s highly technical but revolutionary.”
Finally, her hand rested on the desk. “And Alchemy,“ she said, her voice steady, “is the science of transformation. It’s about breaking down the physical properties of materials and reassembling them into something entirely new. Alchemy requires precision, knowledge, and resourcefulness. Done correctly, it’s incredibly versatile. Done poorly—“ she gave a slight, almost imperceptible shrug, “—it’s unforgiving.”
Eddie felt the weight of each choice pressing down on him. But as Emma’s voice faded, his thoughts drifted again—
He thought of Davies’s words. Catherine’s advice came to mind, too, her calm, encouraging voice urging him to trust in what he was good at. And then there were the hours spent at the apothecary. Every tincture he brewed and every substance he transformed reminded him of what he loved most about magic: the ability to change, adapt, and refine.
“I’ll go with Alchemy,“ he said, his voice resolute.
Emma’s expression remained inscrutable as she studied him. “Alchemy?“ she repeated, her tone carrying a hint of challenge. “Do you understand what you’re committing to? It’s difficult, and your past will follow you here.“
“I know,“ Eddie replied, his voice steady but firm. He met her gaze directly, feeling the weight of his decision settle like a constant flame in his chest.
“Now, let’s cover the topics that will be on the Edenfield’s Faculty of Alchemy entrance exam.” Leaning forward, her demeanour shifted to a more informative one. “You’ll need to demonstrate your understanding of basic alchemical principles, including transmutation and the properties of common materials. There will also be a practical component where you’ll perform a simple alchemical process.“
Eddie’s heart raced as he took it all in. “What kind of process?“
“Something straightforward,” Emma replied coolly.
“Sounds simple enough,“ Eddie said, trying to mask his apprehension.
Emma continued, her tone returning to its earlier sharpness. “I expect you to come prepared. Alchemy is a demanding discipline, and if you want to succeed, you’ll need to prove you can handle it.”

o-
The tram creaked steadily through the inky darkness of the night. Its rhythmic clattering echoed in the silence that enveloped the world outside. Inside one of the dimly lit wagons, Eddie sat alone. The flickering glow of overhead lights framed his silhouette. He leaned against the cool metal window, staring at the blur of shadows.
The tram rumbled along the tracks. Eddie stared out the window, watching the landscape of Central Weshaven. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels provided a comforting backdrop to his swirling thoughts. He could hear the distant hum of murmurs from other passengers. But they felt miles away, as if he were encased in a bubble of stillness. The comforting thrum of the train’s engine contrasted with the sombre weight pressing down on his chest. This ache had settled there long before this journey began.
How am I going to re-learn Alchemy in three weeks? The weight of Emma’s expectations loomed over him like a dark cloud. The idea of preparing for the entrance exam felt daunting, especially after years of stepping away from magic.
He recalled the lessons from his childhood—Catherine’s patient guidance, the endless experiments in her workshop, the intoxicating scent of alchemical ingredients filling the air. But now, those memories felt distant, almost like a forgotten dream. Could he really reclaim that knowledge in such a short time?
Eddie took a deep breath, his mind racing. He would need to gather his old textbooks, dust off his notes, and practice the fundamentals. But where would he even begin? The thought of diving back into a world he had distanced himself from sent a shiver down his spine.
A sudden jolt of the tram snapped him back to reality. He glanced around at the other passengers, each absorbed in their own worlds. Eddie’s heart pounded as he wondered if they had ever faced a challenge as monumental as his.
Outside, the landscape darkened further, swallowed by the night, and Eddie felt a chill creep into the wagon. He wrapped his arms around his knees, a fragile shield against the creeping thought. The world beyond the window was a canvas of obscurity. Yet, within it, he felt the weight of every unspoken word and every missed connection. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 4E_V5</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine sprinted down the stone corridors of the Alchemy Faculty building, her boots skidding against the flagstones as she careened around a corner. Her satchel slammed against her hip with every frantic step, but she didn’t dare slow to adjust it—not when the minute hand on her watch had already crept two minutes past the hour.
Damn it, damn it, damn it—
Professor Hudson’s class had started sixty seconds ago. And everyone knew what that meant: the door would be locked. No exceptions. No mercy. Not even for her with perfect attendance.
She hadn’t meant to lose track of time. But between her backlog of Herbology assignments and the notes she’d been scrawling—notes about The Spike Man, about Eddie, about that thing that moved like a man but wasn’t—the hour had bled away like ink in rain. Now her lungs burned, and the puzzle pieces she’d been trying to force together only grew sharper, more jagged in her mind.
She turned sharply down a narrow hallway, nearly colliding with a floating cart of flasks.
Focus.One thing at a time.
The heavy oaken door to the Herbology lab loomed ahead, carved with ivy and curling vines that shimmered faintly in the light. As she reached for the handle, her heart pounded—half from the run, half from the fear that she was already too late.
But the soft murmur of voices inside met her ears, and when she eased the door open, she exhaled with relief.
Professor Hudson wasn’t here yet.
Inside, students clustered in groups, tending to glass terrariums, adjusting runic lighting, or arguing softly over pruning techniques. The scent of damp moss and pollen clung to the air like mist.
Madeleine slipped inside quietly, closing the heavy door behind her with a soft click. She scanned the room quickly, eyes darting over the clusters of students and their green, glowing plants, until they settled on a familiar figure near the back. Walther sat hunched over his workstation, his fingers moving steadily across a piece of parchment covered in neat, looping script.
Without hesitation, Madeleine crossed the room and slid into the chair beside him. The moment her weight settled, the door creaked again—Professor’s arrival—and the low hum of anticipation rippled through the lab.
Walther looked up briefly, his dark eyes narrowing as he took in the flushed, breathless expression on her face. “Madeleine, you’re late,” he said, voice quiet but edged with mild amusement. “You’re usually the first one here. What kept you? Another all-nighter at the Sanctuary?”
She swallowed, forcing a tired smile. “Something like that.”She didn’t want to say more, especially not here—not with half the class listening and Walther’s perceptive gaze pressing gently but firmly.Instead, she nodded toward his parchment. “What are you working on?”
“The assignment, of course.” Walther rotated the specimen, revealing veins of bioluminescent blue threading through the cactus spines. “Alamirian sun-cactus and Edenfield’s midnight mushroom. Grafted at cellular level.”
She recoiled. “That should be impossible. Their cellular structures are polar opposites—one thrives on light, the other decays in it.”
“It might be if you are talking in Herbology terms,” Walther’s lips twitched. &quot;And yet.&quot; He tapped the dish; the hybrid tissue shuddered. &quot;In, Alchemy. the creation of the mythical philosopher stone is to merge two essential substance of an opposite spectrum into one great creation called the Magnum Opus. If you understand its most essence, all things can merge. Even opposites.&quot; His eyes flicked to hers, sharp as a scalpel. &quot;Imagine what else could be made if only people study cross-disciplines.&quot;
“Well,” Madeleine smiled, “I’m sure it will make something great-”

The door groaned open.
Conversations died mid-syllable. The scrape of chairs, the rustle of parchment—everything stilled as Professor Gareth Hudson stepped into the lecture hall.
He moved like a blade being sheathed: smooth, silent, and sharp enough to draw blood. His polished boots clicked against the stone floor, each step measured, deliberate. The air thickened with the scent of bergamot and iron—his signature blend of alchemical reagents and something darker.
No one breathed too loud.
Hudson didn’t glance at the class. He simply took his seat, slid a leather-bound tome from his desk, and flipped it open. The crack of the spine echoed like a gunshot in the silence.
A full minute passed. The only sound was the turn of a page.
Then—
“What,” he said, without looking up, “Is the subject of today’s lecture?”
The silence grew teeth.
Students stiffened in their seats. A first-year near the front gripped their quill so tight it snapped. Hudson didn’t react. He just waited, his finger resting on a line of text as if to say: I have all day. You don’t.
Then—
“The application of alchemical grafting in medicinal botany.”
Madeleine’s voice cut through the quiet, clear and unflinching.
Hudson’s finger paused. Slowly, he lifted his gaze to hers. The lantern light caught the silver in his hair, the frost in his eyes.
“Can anybody elaborate?”
Madeleine opened her mouth—
“Not you, Mrs. Daedallia.” His voice was a scalpel. “Give chance to the others.”
Silence.
Then—
Then - the scrape of Walther's chair. His voice, calm: &quot;Cross-species grafting via alchemical mediation. Reducing both specimens to their essential salts before recombination allows hybridization beyond natural taxonomical boundaries.&quot; His fingers absently traced the petri dish's edge. &quot;Even between monocots and dicots.&quot;
Hudson's pen stopped mid-margin note. The nib split the paper.
Hudson’s expression didn’t change. “Excellent... Excellent, Mr. Schroder.” He closed the book with a thud that made half the class flinch. “Though you omitted the critical flaw.”
Walther’s pen hovered above his notes. “The… the mortality rate, sir?”
“The arrogance.” Hudson’s fingers steepled, his voice a whip. “What you just described is alchemy—not herbology. You are herbologists, not alchemists. Use your own bloody terms.” His gaze swept the room. “Anyone else?”
Hudson’s gaze locked onto Madeleine like a falcon sighting prey. “
“Since you’re so confident in your herbology knowledge, Mrs. Daedallia—” He gestured to the chalkboard with a flick of his fingers. “Enlighten us. In correct terms.”
A beat of silence. The class held its breath.
Madeleine exhaled through her nose, then stood. Her chair didn’t scrape. Her steps didn’t falter. She reached the board and plucked a piece of chalk from the tray, her fingers steady.
Madeleine nodded absently, still feeling the weight of sleepless nights and the gnawing mystery at the back of her mind. She reached down to her satchel to pull out her binders, intending to get her notes ready.
But as she yanked the bag up hastily, her tired fingers slipped. Instead of the binder’s sturdy spine, her grip caught the loose papers tucked behind it. In an instant, a flurry of parchment spiraled out, fluttering down like autumn leaves across the stone floor.
“Oh, no,” Madeleine muttered under her breath, cheeks flushing as she crouched to gather the scattered sheets.
Walther, sitting beside her, was already reaching down to help, his calm presence a quiet anchor amid her embarrassment. 
“Here,” he said softly, handing her a few papers with an easy efficiency.
“Thanks,” she murmured, biting her lip as she carefully stacked them back into the binder.
“Be careful next time alright? This is not a good time to-“
As Madeleine crouched, carefully gathering the scattered papers with Walther’s steady help. Each sheet slipped back into her binder brought a small wave of relief. Almost all of it was accounted for—except one.
Her eyes followed Walther’s gaze as he held a single page between his fingers. His expression shifted sharply, a flicker of something like horror mixed with disbelief crossing his usually unreadable face.
“Walther?” Madeleine’s voice was low but urgent. 
He didn’t say a word, his fingers tightening around the paper as if it burned him. Her heart quickened, unease prickling beneath her skin.
A shadow fell over them.
“Is there a problem, Mrs. Daedallia?”
Professor Hudson loomed above, his polished boots inches from the scattered papers. His gaze flicked to the sketch still trapped between Walther’s fingers.
A beat. Two.
Then—
“I see you’ve taken up photography.” Hudson’s voice was dry as bone. “Though your proportions are off. Alamirian tigers have five lumbar vertebrae, not six.”
With a quick tug, she yanked the page from his grasp, pulling it closer to her. Her breath caught as she recognized the photograph taped across the parchment.
It was the polaroid she took—the detailed, haunting photo of the Chimaera.
Madeleine’s pulse hammered in her ears as Walther’s wide eyes met hers, his usual calm shattered for a fleeting moment. She quickly hid the paper beneath her binder, forcing her voice steady.
“Where did you...?”
Walther’s lips pressed into a thin line, eyes darkening. For the first time, the mysterious distance around him felt like something more—something dangerous.
Madeleine swallowed, her secret suddenly feeling heavier than ever. 

-o-

The moon hung low over Edenfield’s towering spires, its silver glow pooling on the cobbled pathways. Lanterns flickered in the cold breeze as Madeleine stepped out of the Alchemy building, tugging her scarf tighter and buttoning her coat all the way up to her chin. The night bit at her cheeks, and the long day pressed against her shoulders like a weight.
The classroom emptied like a sinking ship—students fleeing into the night, their chatter swallowed by the groan of the oak doors. Madeleine lingered just long enough to seem unhurried, adjusting her scarf with deliberate slowness. The wool scratched her jaw, but the cold bit deeper.
&quot;Mrs. Daedallia.&quot;
Hudson’s voice slithered through the drafty hall. He stood framed by the window, moonlight carving his silhouette into something sharp and surgical.
&quot;You care for a chat?&quot;
It wasn’t a question.
Madeleine’s fingers tightened around her satchel strap. &quot;Of course, Professor.&quot;
Hudson leaned against the stone windowsill, the moonlight cutting across his face. For a moment, he looked almost human—tired, maybe. Then the mask slid back into place.
&quot;That sketch of yours,&quot; he said, tapping his gloved fingers against the sill. &quot;Where’d you get the idea? Not many have seen a South Alamirian Tiger up close.&quot;
A beat. Madeleine’s pulse thudded in her throat.
&quot;Just something I cobbled together,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably inaccurate.&quot;
Hudson chuckled—a rare, dry sound. &quot;I’ve handled more of those beasts than the Sanctuary’s records show. Their stripe patterns are like fingerprints. Yours was… close.&quot;
Too close.
Madeleine’s fingers twitched toward her satchel, where the sketch was hidden. &quot;Lucky guess.&quot;
&quot;Of course.&quot; His smile didn’t reach his eyes. He knew she was lying.
Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken things. Then—
&quot;You remind me of her,&quot; Hudson said abruptly.
Madeleine blinked. &quot;Who?&quot;
&quot;My daughter.&quot; His voice was quieter now, the edge dulled. &quot;Livia. She was like you—curious. Smart. Argued with professors twice her age just to see if she could win.&quot; A pause. &quot;It got her into trouble sometimes.&quot;
There was something in his tone—a warning, or a regret. Madeleine couldn’t tell.
&quot;She sounds like someone I’d like to meet,&quot; she offered. &quot;Maybe she could volunteer at the Sanctuary with—&quot;
&quot;She’s gone.&quot; Hudson cut her off, his voice flat. &quot;Vanished before she ever set foot in Edenfield.&quot;
The words hung in the air like frost.
Madeleine’s breath caught. &quot;I… I’m sorry.&quot;
Hudson straightened, his gloves creaking as he flexed his hands. &quot;Don’t be. Curiosity isn’t a crime.&quot; He met her gaze, and for the first time, his icy demeanor cracked just enough to show the grief beneath. &quot;But it has consequences.&quot;
The words hung between them, sharp as a scalpel left on a lab table. The wind outside rattled the windowpanes, but neither moved.
Then—
&quot;Tell me, you’ve known me two years now,&quot; Hudson said, his voice quieter than she’d ever heard it. &quot;In class. At the Sanctuary. Tell me honestly…
“do you think I’m a bad father?&quot;
Madeleine’s breath caught.
This wasn’t Professor Hudson the alchemist, the disciplinarian, the man who locked lecture doors at the first chime of the clock. This was just Gareth Hudson, a man with a missing daughter and a grief he couldn’t dissolve in acid or bury in research.
She could lie. She should lie.
But Madeleine had never been good at that.
&quot;I don’t know,&quot; she said slowly, meeting his gaze. &quot;But if you raised your daughter like you teach your classes…&quot; She hesitated, then forged ahead. &quot;She might’ve thought you didn’t care. Even if you did.&quot;
Silence.
Hudson’s face didn’t change, but his gloved hand flexed at his side, like he was gripping an invisible vial too tight.
Madeleine immediately regretted it. &quot;I’m sorry. That was—&quot;
Hudson chuckled.
A real, genuine laugh—low and rough, like gravel underfoot. Madeleine had never heard it before. Her face flushed hot.
&quot;Do you hate my teaching so much,&quot; he said, shaking his head, &quot;that you assumed I raised my children the same way?&quot;
Madeleine stiffened, her ears burning. &quot;I— That’s not what I—&quot;
&quot;Oh, I think it was.&quot; His smirk was faint but unmistakable. &quot;Go on, then. Since we’re being honest.&quot; He crossed his arms. &quot;What’s so extreme about my methods?&quot;
Madeleine exhaled sharply. &quot;You lock students out for being a minute late. You grade like a war tribunal. Half your class has stress-induced nosebleeds before midterms.&quot; She paused, then added, &quot;Sir.&quot;
Hudson’s smirk deepened. &quot;And yet, you’re still here.&quot;
&quot;Because I- not everyone can do what I do,&quot; she admitted grudgingly. &quot;It’s brutal!&quot;
For a moment, he just studied her, the ghost of amusement still lingering. Then his gaze drifted past her, toward the darkened hallway, as if seeing something—or someone—else.
&quot;In my previous career,&quot; he said, voice softer now, &quot;that was how we taught. No second chances. No room for error.&quot; A pause. &quot;And we produced the finest alchemists in the kingdom.&quot;
There was something in his tone—pride, yes, but also a quiet ache.
Madeleine tilted her head. &quot;Previous career?&quot;
Hudson’s expression shuttered. &quot;Go home, Mrs. Daedallia.&quot; He turned back toward the window, the moonlight washing him pale again. &quot;And for God’s sake, stop drawing creatures you don’t understand.&quot;
The dismissal was clear. But this time, as Madeleine turned to leave, she caught the way his fingers brushed against the locket at his throat—just once, like a reflex.
Madeleine hesitated at the corridor’s edge, her scarf fluttering in the icy draft. “You’re not going home? Curfew’s in ten minutes.”
Hudson didn’t turn around. “Campus business.” His gloves flexed around a brass key—too large for a desk drawer, too small for a door.
She should’ve left. But curiosity hooked into her ribs.
“Professor,” she called after him, “what did you do before Edenfield?”
Silence. Then—
“Crownstead Military Academy.” His voice was flat, stripped of its earlier humor. “Instructor, Seventh Spearhead Division. I was a Military Alchemist.”
Military alchemist. The words landed like a lit fuse.
Images snapped into place: his precision, his contempt for hesitation, the way he’d described grafting as “arrogance”—not on ethical grounds, but tactical ones.
Then he was gone, his footsteps echoing down the hall—too rhythmic to be anything but marching.

The scene ends with a similar scene on how Eddie got attacked, but this time, Madeleiene got kidnapped


Professor Hudson at the moment taught Alchemical Grafting,And in this class he taught the application of Alchemical Grafting in creating plants with a desired properties for medicines

PROFESSOR HUDSON IS A RED HERRING, THE CULPRIT IS WALTHER

Professor Hudson talked to Madeleine after class in which he asked about her sketch,Madeleine in return asked Professor Hudson’s method of teaching, saying that it’s kind of extreme, but Professor Hudson said that in his previous career, it was how he teach, and he made the best batch of students that way.

At the last moment, it is revealed that Professor Hudson was teaching at Crownstead Military Academy. He was a soldier.

Note that Professor Hudson was a military veteran, probably to the rank of general

            <Text>1. The Protagonist
a. The protagonist is Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Welton, during the main story he is 20 years old, but in the prologue, he is 16, in his Grade 11 of his Secondary School. he used to be brash, energetic and stood up for the bullied. but since his expulsion from highschool, he is very withdrawn and quiet.

b. His biggest desire is to have meaning, currently after his expulsion he has thrown away all hope that he could get anywhere in life, and so he is just drifting by. His biggest fear is that it becoming true.

c. The coming of age part of his journey is in the Catalyst part of the story, where he got kidnapped by a mysterious man in black, and conciously bend the handcuffs that is holding him, and being saved by Catherine. and then revealed that all his random abilities and weird things that had happened around him, and him being able to see molecules and sometimes bend then at random was a part of his &quot;Gift&quot; and not his disorder

2. The Setting and The School

a. during this 1st act, the story takes place in Ontario, Canada. but when Eddie is enrolling himself in University of Edenfield, he will sail and go to the hidden 8th continent called Archaea, where there is a city called Edenfield, where he will continue his study

b. the school is a University. called University of Edenfield in a city called Edenfield. it's a university focusing in the study and research of Magical Knowledges and Arts like Alchemy, Enchantments, Witchcraft, etc it is in a hidden 8th continent that will appear to not exist to those who have no connections to it. but those who have ancestors and families who has been there, they could see its existence, and apparently Eddie was one of them

c. The urban fantasy flavour of the city is the mythical creatures existing altogether in Edenfield. the centaur in business suit, a knight wearing headphones in the metro, dragons heating up cakes in fancy cafes

3. The Magic

a. The event that kicks off the plot is that Eddie turns out was hunted by this mysterious man in black, where during one time when he hung out with his friends, since he could see molecules, he can see that his drink is spiked, and he intentionally spill them. this gave the mysterious men the confirmation that Eddie has Alchemists blood, and he will be kidnapped and saved by his future mentor Catherine the Elf

b. The antagonist so far is still unknown, but what is known is that there are secret underground organisations that is working, and all the crime in Edenfield seems to have a centralised plan in them. and not a random occurance.

The overall theme of this story will be &quot;Change&quot; which is why the magic system Eddie inherited is Alchemy. in this 1st act Eddie is afraid of change. the last major change in his life was his expulsion from secondary school and how his friends ostracise him even in town. when Catherine comes to him offering to personally sponsor and be his guardian in his scholarship in Edenfield to harness and study his inherited ability, Eddie rejected it. it will be a huge change. he will not only move cities anymore, he will move continent. evermore, it was a continent that shouldn't or never existed in the first place.

But after the catalyst he will embraced change. he will leave his old, broken self behind and let himself be reborn in this distant city, perhaps he will find his new self in there. he then accepted Catherine's scholarship and met his agent with Catherine somewhere in Ottawa, where he will be tested in his Alchemical ability to see whether he is worth the Scholarship or not, (He will eventually will.)

That is the informations i can give you at the moment, i will tell you what to write in the prologue later, for now i want you to first understand the whole vibe of the story</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1E V4</Title>
            <Text>“…I’m telling you, it wasn’t human,” Henry’s deep voice murmured, tight with tension. “I hit it square with a shockburst. Thing barely flinched. Just leapt—straight over the hedge like it was nothing.”
Will replied, quieter. “You think it was a loose creature?”
“No. Too coordinated. It didn’t move like an animal. It had—purpose.”
There was a pause. Then Ashley’s voice, attempting lightness.
“Maybe you’re just sleep-deprived, Henry. You’ve been stuck in the archives for, what, forty hours now? The curfew warnings have your face on them.”
A scoff. “I know what I saw, Ash. Eddie was on the ground bleeding, and that thing turned and looked at me like it knew what it was doing.”
Another silence. This one longer. Then:
“…You think it targeted him?”
Eddie opened his eyes.
Everything was too bright. The walls were sterile white, curtains drawn halfway to the ceiling. He was lying in a crisp infirmary bed, head pounding, bandages tight around his chest. The air smelled of lavender and alchemical salve.
He groaned, and all three of them turned at once.
“Eddie!” Ashley leapt up first, nearly knocking over a cup of water. “You’re alive! I mean—I knew you were alive, but still. You gave us a heart attack.”
Will stepped forward, his face carefully composed, but his shoulders had dropped in relief. “We thought you were out for days.”
Henry’s arms were crossed, standing near the foot of the bed. He nodded. “You got lucky.”
It was Ashley who spoke first, gently, “Eddie, do you remember anything? What did you see?”
Eddie hesitated, gaze flicking between their faces. The memories were disjointed—shadows, pressure, a whisper not meant for the air. “I… I don’t know. It’s all scrambled.”
Henry exhaled through his nose. “Then I’ll tell it.”
He stepped forward, voice calm but clipped. “It was around two in the morning. I was at the Automatons Faculty building, testing a construct for my thesis. Thought I heard someone yell, ‘Get away!’—sharp, desperate. Figured someone was breaking curfew, maybe drunk.”
He paused. “But when I followed the voice, I found you. On the ground.”
Will’s brow furrowed. Ashley leaned in.
“There was… someone kneeling over you,” Henry said slowly. “I couldn’t tell what they were doing. I shouted, told him to get lost, raised my staff—”
He stopped, fingers tightening around his sleeve. “And then I saw his face. Or… tried to.”
A silence stretched.
Ashley tilted her head. “Tried to?”
Henry’s mouth twitched. “It wasn’t right. I mean—I saw a face. But every time I try to describe it, the image slips. It was… wrong. Like a sketch someone kept erasing and redrawing mid-glance.”
He looked to Eddie, searching. “You saw it too. Didn’t you?”
Eddie stared down at the blanket, fingers curling in the fabric. “I… yeah. I saw it. But I can’t tell you what I saw.”
Will’s voice was quiet. “That’s not normal.”
“No,” Henry agreed. “It really isn’t.”
Silence settled over the infirmary like a blanket.
Will leaned back slightly in his chair, brows drawn. Ashley’s smile had long since faded, and even she looked uncharacteristically tense. Henry stood still at the foot of the bed, eyes distant, reliving a moment he clearly didn’t want to remember.
No one said it aloud—but the thought was mutual.
If even Henry and Eddie couldn’t explain what they saw…If the memory itself recoiled from being remembered…
Then maybe the rumors were true.
There was something lurking in Edenfield at night.
Madeleine stood in the entryway, her breath caught, eyes wide with worry. A pale scarf hung loosely around her shoulders, hastily thrown over a cardigan. Behind her, Clara  stood with her hands folded neatly in front of her, gaze sharp beneath the gentle furrow of her brow.
Madeleine’s eyes immediately found Henry.
“How is he?” she asked, her voice low and urgent.
Henry looked over his shoulder at Eddie, then back to her. “He’s awake,” he said. “But his leg’s hurt pretty bad.”
Only then did Madeleine step closer and look at Eddie fully—her expression softening with equal parts relief and concern. </Text>

            <Text>The frantic pace lasted for two blocks, his footsteps echoing in the narrow alleyways between the old faculty halls. Only when he was sure he was out of immediate sight did his sprint slow to a brisk, panting walk. The high-stakes tension of the council room began to dissipate, replaced by the quiet hum of the Edenfield night. The only sounds were the cold wind whistling through the eaves of the buildings and the rhythmic chirp of crickets and cicadas hidden in the manicured campus shrubbery.
He ducked behind the thick trunk of an oak tree near the edge of the quad, his heart still hammering against his ribs. He pulled out his smartphone, the screen lighting up his face in the gloom. The first thing he checked was his call log. One missed call. From Madeleine. His stomach tightened again.
He swiped over to his photo gallery. The pictures were hasty, some blurry, but he’d gotten what he needed. He scrolled past photos of mundane university correspondence, budget sheets, and then, he found it. A clear shot of a personnel transfer document. His finger zoomed in on a specific line.
Previous Occupation: Military Alchemist. Last Held Post: Instructor, Crownstead Military Academy.
“Interesting…” Eddie whispered to himself, a grim satisfaction cutting through his anxiety. He wasn't just guessing anymore. He had proof.
It was then that his phone buzzed violently in his hand, the screen lighting up with her name again. He accepted it instantly.
“Hey, Madeleine, I think I found a lead to—”
There was a sharp breath of relief on the other end. “Eddie? Eddie? Hello? It’s me.”
“Madeleine?” His back straightened against the tree bark. “Are you… okay? You sound—”
“Listen,” she cut in, voice taut and quick, like a pulled string. “I don’t have time to explain. I need you tonight to discuss something.”
Eddie blinked, confused by her tone. “Wait, what’s happened? What’s going on?”
“It’s—” Her voice cut out for a second, dissolving into a faint crackle. “It’s Professor Hudson. I think he knows—”
Bzzzt.
A loud burst of static screamed through the speaker. Eddie yanked the phone away from his ear, flinching.
“Madeleine?” he called into the noise, his thumb hovering over the redial button. “Hello? Madeleine?”
Silence. Then a low mechanical whir. Then nothing. He glanced back in the direction of the faculty building and his blood ran cold. Two familiar, bulky silhouettes had emerged onto the lawn, moving under the lamplight, already searching. The Student Council members were free.
“Come on…” he muttered, pressing the phone harder to his ear.
Suddenly— Click.
“Hello?” he tried again, his breath held.
A gasp on the other end. “E-Eddie!”
He gripped the phone tighter. “Madeleine, what’s happening?”
“I think someone’s following me.”
His stomach dropped. “Where are you?”
There was a pause. A rustle of fabric. Then, distantly through the speaker, he heard the creak of a booth door opening. Her voice dropped to a terrified whisper.
“I’m at my apartment. Just past the old fence. Near the east ward sign. There’s someone—he’s not moving, but—”
The line cracked again, loud and sharp.
“I’ve got my wand—he’s coming closer—Eddie, I—”
Pop.
The line went dead.
Eddie stood there, frozen, the soft dial tone humming against his ear like a dirge. The phone felt like a block of ice in his hand.
Someone’s following me... he’s coming closer...
He looked up from his phone, his eyes darting into the darkness of the campus. The two bulky silhouettes of the Student Council members were still there, fanning out across the lawn, but they felt distant now, like a problem from another lifetime. Expulsion. Dorm confinement. None of it mattered. The methodical, institutional threat of Victoria Aynesworth was nothing compared to the raw, immediate terror in Madeleine’s voice.
His mind raced, replaying her words. My apartment... past the old fence... near the east ward sign. The east ward. That was back the way he came. Back towards them.
He didn't hesitate.
Panic, worry, and a white-hot surge of determination erased every instinct for self-preservation. He shoved his phone into his pocket and broke from the cover of the trees, sprinting back onto the main path. He wasn't running from danger anymore. He was running towards his friend.
He saw them under the next gaslamp—Victoria pointing, directing her two guards. They saw him at the same moment. A look of triumph flashed across Victoria’s face. Their quarry was cornered.
“Get him!” she bellowed, her voice echoing across the silent quad.
The two guards moved to intercept, forming a wall of muscle to block his path. But Eddie didn't slow down. He didn't try to change direction. He ran straight at them.
Just as the first guard reached for him, Eddie feinted left and then cut hard to the right, ducking under a clumsy, outstretched arm. He dodged past the second guard with a burst of desperate speed, his feet pounding on the stone path. He ran right past them, leaving them standing there, bewildered.
Even Victoria was stunned into silence for a moment, her mouth slightly agape. What the hell was this kid thinking? He had a clear path to escape, and yet he was running deeper into campus, straight through them.
Her shock lasted only a second before it hardened back into fury.
“Get him! Don’t let him escape!” Victoria shouted, pointing in the direction Eddie was now heading. Recovering, the two guards turned and gave chase, their heavy footfalls thudding behind him as they pursued him into the night.

The lecture hall had emptied out ten minutes ago, but Will’s pace was slow as he walked the stone path back toward the dorms. The sun had long since set, and the Edenfield campus was bathed in the cool, silver light of the moon and the warm, flickering glow of gaslamps. The wind was picking up, rustling through the old oak trees and making the long shadows of the spires dance and twist like living things.
He clutched the strap of his satchel, his mind miles away from his evening lecture on transmutational theory. It was on Eddie. Always on Eddie these days. He remembered their last conversation in the infirmary, the fight about him getting involved. Now, Eddie was distant, secretive, always buried in some restricted text or slipping away without a word. Will was worried. Worried about the Chimaeras, yes, but more worried about his best friend getting himself expelled. Or worse.
He was so lost in thought that he didn't hear the light, quick footsteps behind him.
Suddenly—bam!
A pair of arms wrapped around his chest from behind, and a familiar weight landed on his back. Will jumped, his heart lurching into his throat as he stumbled forward, nearly dropping his satchel.
“Hey there, mr. downer!” Ashley’s cheerful voice chirped right next to his ear. She let go, jogging to walk beside him, a wide grin on her face. Her Witchcraft robes were still draped over her arm. “How’d class go?”
Will took a deep breath, trying to slow his racing pulse. “Ash, don’t do that,” he said, his voice more tired than angry. “Especially not at night. I’m glad it was you and not… I don’t know, a Chimaera or something.” He ran a hand through his hair. “The rumors about Eddie’s attack are all over campus. No one feels safe walking alone after dark anymore.”
Ashley’s grin widened mischievously. She puffed out her chest and curled her hands into claws. “Maybe I am a Chimaera,” she said, her voice a low growl. “A human-tiger hybrid, and I’m about to eat you! Waaaaargh!”
She clearly expected him to quip back, to shove her playfully or roll his eyes. But he didn’t. He just sighed and kept walking, his gaze fixed on the path ahead.
The silence that followed was immediate. Ashley’s playful demeanor vanished in an instant. She was happy-go-lucky, but she was also deeply empathetic, and his lack of response was a louder signal than any argument. She fell into step beside him, her expression turning serious and analytical.
She let him walk for a few more paces before speaking, her voice gentle now.
“You’re still worried about Eddie, aren’t you?”
Will’s shoulders sagged slightly. He tried to brush it off with a shrug, but he couldn’t meet her perceptive gaze. After a few more steps in silence, he sighed, the sound swallowed by the night air.
“I guess… I was just feeling guilty about yesterday,” he admitted, his voice low. “I shouldn't have been so harsh on him.”
Ashley tilted her head, her curiosity genuine. “What makes you change your mind? You were okay with sneaking into the library and taking that book from the restricted section before. Why not now?”
“Because,” Will said, stopping on the path and turning to face her fully. “I feel like this is something big. Bigger than us. I might not agree with how he’s been acting for the last few weeks, the secrecy and all that… but I feel like he’s actually onto something this time.”
“And that’s good, isn’t it?” Ashley said, her voice becoming light and hopeful again. “If he’s right, then he can prove it and this whole thing will be over.”
“No,” Will said, his expression grim. “It’s not good. Because if he’s right, he’s not up against the Student Council or the faculty anymore. If this is from the outside, then he's probably up against someone far more powerful.”
The hope in Ashley’s eyes flickered and died, replaced by a shared understanding of the danger. They started walking again, the silence between them heavier now. The only sounds were Will's steady footsteps on the stone and the occasional scuff of Ashley’s sneakers as she kicked a loose pebble along the path.
“He can’t do it alone,” Will finally said, the words heavy with a conclusion he’d been fighting for days.
“Then we shouldn’t let him be,” Ashley replied instantly, her voice sure and clear.
Will frowned in confusion. “What do you mean? We shouldn’t let him go?”
“No, dummy.” Ashley nudged him hard with her elbow, a spark of her usual mischief returning. “We shouldn’t let him go alone.”
The simple clarification landed in Will’s mind like a key turning in a lock. He stopped again, looking at her as the weight on his shoulders seemed to visibly lift. A slow smile spread across his face, a genuine one this time, reaching his eyes. He let out a short, relieved chuckle. She was right. It was that simple. They were a team.
“You’re insufferable,” Will chuckled, shaking his head fondly as they started walking again, their steps now in sync.
A genuine smile lit Will’s face as they started walking again, the weight of his worry finally lifted. For the first time in weeks, it felt like they were back on the same page, a team again. The path ahead seemed a little brighter, the night air less oppressive.
Their comfortable silence was shattered by a sharp, commanding shout that cut through the night.
“Stop him!”
Will and Ashley both froze, heads snapping in the direction of the voice. It came from the direction of the main quad, near the faculty buildings.
“Is that…” Ashley began, squinting into the distance.
“Is that Eddie?” Will finished, his own voice tight with a dawning sense of dread.
As if on cue, a figure burst into view, sprinting past the gap between the Alchemy and Herbology halls. There was no mistaking the bellowing brown jacket and ripped jeans. It was Eddie. Seconds later, three more figures followed in hot pursuit: Victoria Aynesworth, her face a mask of cold fury, flanked by her two hulking Student Council guards.
Will stared, his newfound peace evaporating into pure exasperation.
“Bollocks,” he cursed under his breath. “What did he do this time?!”
But before he could even fully process the scene, Ashley was already moving. With her  robes billowing behind her like a battle cloak in the wind, she broke into a dead sprint toward the chaos.
“Come on!” she shouted back at him, not even breaking stride. “We can still help him!”
Will stood rooted to the spot for a single, agonizing moment. Every rational part of his brain screamed at him to turn around, to go back to the dorm, to stay out of it. This was it. This was the final warning. Getting involved now meant expulsion, no questions asked.
He looked from Ashley’s retreating figure to the chase unfolding across the quad. He saw his best friend, alone, running from a fight he couldn’t possibly win.
“Screw it,” he muttered to himself.
He broke into a run, his satchel bouncing against his back as he sprinted to catch up.
“Hey, Ash! Wait up!”</Text>
            <Notes>On this Chapter when the POV goes back to Eddie,

Eddie should also be finding a clue too, in fact he should be the one getting the clues Harder

There will be Conflict with Victoria as Eddie is caught trying to get informations about the Political Organisations in Edenfield. Which is strictly forbidden by the Student Council, and that Students are not allowed to join the local political groups, they are only allowed to join university ones


At the end on Eddie’s persuit, Eddie stumbles upon Will and Ashley, who then goes after him together with the Student Council

Eddie might be caught sneaking up to the Professors Office at night sneaking up to Professor Hudson’s files</Notes>

            <Text>Four years had passed since that Incident.
Four long years of self-exile, self-discovery, and self-loathing for a boy called Edward Welton.
But let’s briefly not talk about him, shall we?
For when everything ended,
It began for someone.
In a distant kingdom of Edenfield, in the deep northernmost island of its reach called Weshaven, in an apothecary that is made from a repurposed lighthouse.
A girl stood before a tall mirror, adjusting the brim of her pointed black hat. Her long, silky brown hair swayed in twin tails as she tilted her head, inspecting her reflection with wide, eager eyes behind oversized round glasses. A yellow knit sweater peeked out from beneath the freshly pressed folds of a long black robe.
She adjusted the brim one last time, tugged on her robe again, and looked back at the mirror.
She grinned.
Her heart swelled with excitement, her fingers tracing the embroidered crest on her robe. Today was the first step toward something wonderful.
A voice carried through the house, breaking her reverie.
“Torrie! Breakfast is ready! Come to the dining room!”
She spun away from the mirror, bouncing her way out of her room.
“Yes, Mom!” she called back, already rushing toward the door.
Torrie stepped into the dining room, the scent of fish soup filling the air, rich and comforting. 
Sunlight streamed through the white silky curtain above the sink, glinting off the wooden table where two steaming bowls sat waiting. Her mother, stood by the counter, wiping her hands on a cloth.
“Look at you, beginning your first years in Aella Academy.” Mrs. Welton smiled, lingering by the table, her eyes soft with nostalgia. &quot;Let me see you properly,&quot; she said, stepping closer.
Torrie straightened, smoothing the folds of her robe. &quot;Like this?&quot;
With a playful grin, Torrie twirled in place, the hem of her robe flaring out as she spun. She came to a stop with a little flourish, looking up at her mother expectantly.
&quot;You remind me so much of your brother,&quot; Mrs. Welton mused.
 “Do I?” Torrie looked up, curious.
&quot;Not exactly, but you both are very excited. On his first day at Aella Academy,&quot; her mother continued, &quot;He was so eager, he didn’t even bother with breakfast. Just grabbed his things and took off on his bicycle straight to the harbor. Couldn’t wait to board the ferry to Osthaven.&quot;
Torrie chuckled, stirring her soup. &quot;Didn’t expect him to be that excited.&quot;
 &quot;Oh, but he was,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;Speaking of your brother… Where is he? Didn’t he say he’d be the one to take you himself?&quot;
Torrie shrugged. &quot;Haven’t seen him.&quot;
Mrs. Welton exhaled, rubbing her temple. &quot;Of course.&quot; She stood, pushing her chair back with a sigh.
Then she cupped her hands around her mouth and called up the stairs. &quot;Edward?!&quot;
Silence.
Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;You stay here, hon. I’ll go see if he’s still in his room.&quot;
She turned and strode toward the staircase, muttering under her breath. Torrie just smiled, spooning up a mouthful of soup as she waited.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 2</Title>
            <Text>The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by the second floor’s oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 

-o-


Beyond the attic door, the room lay in comfortable chaos. The space was dim, save for the slivers of morning light through his curtains. casting long, golden beams across the floor.
Clothes strewn carelessly across the floor, some draped over the back of a chair, some half-tucked under the bed, some long forgotten. 
Books were everywhere. Its stacked haphazardly on the desk, toppled over on the nightstand, spread open on the unmade bed as if abandoned mid-thought. 
Loose parchment spilled onto the wooden floor, some pages crumpled, others torn at the edges. Half-sketched transmutation circles and scribbled formulas peeked out from beneath the clutter, most of them bore the chaotic scribbling of frustation.
Its walls bore remnants of faded posters. Some curling at the edges, one hanging on by a single pin. 
A calendar sat pinned to the wall near the door, its pages frozen in time.
The last date marked in red ink from seven years ago.
26th of April, 1920.
Near the farthest wall, a wooden desk was buried beneath the weight of research. Transmutation circles sketched and then discarded overflowed from a bin at the desk’s side. Diagrams detailing herbs, plants and mushrooms. Their alchemical properties meticulously annotated in a careful yet restless hand. 
Stacked books, their spines cracked from repeated use, bore names in gilded lettering—, Modern Alchemy by Magnus Borman, and a vintage tome The Ancient Arts of Alchemy signed only Catherine. Amid the scholarly collection sat a battered notebook filled with translations of an even older text, one written by Casnius Bolos, one of the nine sages of enlightenment. The Father of Alchemy.
And slumped over it all, was the room’s lone occupant.
His maroon diamond-patterned sweater hung loosely over his slumped shoulders, its sleeves pushed up to his elbows. His silver hair fell messily over his forehead, unkempt from restless nights. His posture was hunched, arms folded beneath his head, his breathing slow and steady in slumber.
In his ears, a pair of makeshift headphones—wired together in an unorthodox fashion—hummed faintly with a distant, crackling signal. Plugged into an even more makeshift radio, the device played something indiscernible, some half-lost frequency from far beyond Weshaven. Whether it was music or the muffled voices of a broadcast, only he could tell.
The knocking at the door continued. A soft, measured rhythm, persistent against the wood.
Still, he did not stir. Succumbing to his sleep and the sounds from distant lands.

-o-


She knocked again—more resolutely, as if the sound itself could unravel the silence that enveloped the room. 

“Eddie?” She called, yet no answer. 

Mrs. Welton sighed, “Of course, I knew it’ll come to this.”

Slipping her hand into her skirt pocket and touching her wand's smooth wooden surface. With a slight wrist movement, the wand appeared. A thin piece of dark oak with intricate interlocking ornaments. 

She pointed it at the door's lock, and a gentle click rattled the quiet attic, flickering the runes around the lock before dissolving into the shadows. She tucked her wand away and gently opened the door. 

The room was full of clutter.

Mrs. Welton’s gaze swept the room, her eyebrows lifting slightly as she took in the disarray.

 “Of course,” she muttered under her breath, stepping carefully over a crumpled tunic on the floor. “A storm couldn’t have done a better job.” 

She stared at the figure slumped on the desk, immovable except for his breathing breathing. Crackling of faint jazz music could be heard from the makeshift headset on the radio.

“Edward Welton! ” she yelled, her tone sharp but laced with exasperated fondness. 
The name cut through the attic like a thunderclap.
Eddie jolted awake so violently that his chair tipped backward. His arms flailed, his headset yanked free with a sharp crackle of static, and the makeshift radio tumbled off the desk with a clatter. 
Books, parchments, loose papers exploded into the air, cascading down like confetti in a parade of overwork. His foot caught on something—maybe a discarded tunic, maybe an open book—and he tumbled off his chair entirely, landing flat on his back with a heavy thud.
From the floor, he let out a groggy, half-incoherent groan. “Mum—what the hell?”
Mrs. Welton, unimpressed, loomed over him with her hands on her hips. &quot;You agreed weeks ago to accompany Torrie on her first day of school! I'm not letting her get lost in Osthaven while you spend all morning hibernating like some bear in a cave!&quot;
She crossed the room with purpose, the floorboards thumping beneath her feet.
Eddie sat up, rubbing his silver hair, still blinking off the remnants of sleep. “Could you at least knock first?” he grumbled.
&quot;I did knock!&quot; Mrs. Welton shot back, pointing at the unlocked door. &quot;But you were too busy listening to—” she gestured vaguely at the tangled mess of wires, the radio now buzzing with distorted, half-drowned static. “—whatever that is.”
Eddie picked up his fallen headset, giving the radio a once-over before dusting it off. &quot;It's called jazz, Mum,&quot; he said, as if that explained everything. &quot;They're pretty famous in the city, you know?&quot;
&quot;Like I care about that, Edward!&quot; Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;Now get up before Torrie is late for her first day at Aella!&quot;
Eddie groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. &quot;Aella?&quot; he muttered, his voice still thick with sleep. &quot;Torrie’s in Aella now?&quot;
Mrs. Welton pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;She is. Did you forget that too?&quot;
&quot;Look, Mum,&quot; Eddie pushed himself up, wincing as he untangled his legs from a mess of books and crumpled clothes. &quot;It’s difficult to keep track of things when Dad’s remedies need tweaking every two days.&quot; He stretched, his back popping as he tried to shake off the last bits of sleep. &quot;Can I clean up a bit before we go?&quot;
Mrs. Welton bent down with a sigh, picking up the books and papers that had scattered across the floor. Unlike Eddie, who left things in precarious heaps, she stacked them neatly, smoothing out crumpled pages before placing them back onto his desk.
&quot;You should at least try to keep things organized,&quot; she scolded, adjusting a pile of alchemy notes. &quot;Honestly, Edward, I don’t know how you can work like this.&quot;
&quot;I do work like this,&quot; Eddie shot back as he pulled a fresh shirt from a chair—though it was debatable how fresh it actually was. He gave it a quick sniff before pulling it on. &quot;I’ve been busy experimenting with potion ingredients for the apothecary. It’s not like I’m just lounging around.&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 17 RAW-1</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Torrie settled down at the side of the Traveller’s Path as the night deepened around them. The glowing Eden Flowers cast a gentle, golden light over the path, creating a serene atmosphere amidst the dense darkness of the Deep Glaive. Eddie sat on the edge of the path, his gaze fixed on the flickering lights of the Eden Flowers. On the other hand, Torrie focused on a more delicate task. She deftly wove Eden Flowers into a crown, her small fingers moving with practised ease.
Eddie glanced at her, a hint of curiosity in his voice. “So, Torrie, how do you feel about seeing Catherine again?”
Torrie looked up from her flower crown, her expression of thoughtful satisfaction. “I’m happy. Not every day you meet someone with so much knowledge and experience. Aunt Catherine has travelled far and studied so much. Being able to learn from her is fascinating.”
“Yeah,” Eddie flashed a faint smile “it’s... good to see her again.”
Torrie’s smile widened slightly but didn’t reach her eyes as much as before. “And what about you? How do you feel about meeting her again?”
Eddie shrugged, his tone neutral. “It’s alright.”
Torrie’s smile faltered, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Eddie’s face. “Just that? Nothing else fascinates you about her return?”
The shift in Torrie’s tone was subtle but unmistakable. The casualness of the conversation began to dissipate, replaced by an undercurrent of tension. Eddie’s smile faded, and he looked away, his expression suddenly distant.
“It’s just... seeing her again is... cool… She’s awesome.” Eddie replied, his voice lacking its earlier warmth. He glanced at Torrie, whose previously bright demeanour had now shifted to something more serious.
Torrie’s eyes searched his face, her gaze intense. “Are you telling me that’s all there is to it? You don’t feel anything else about her returning after all this time?”
Eddie shifted uncomfortably. “It’s not like that. I just... I don’t know. She’s still the same person she was before.”
Torrie’s smile had vanished entirely, replaced by a frown of concern and confusion. “Eddie, I thought you’d be more... interested. You used to look up to her so much. Doesn’t it bother you that she seems different now?”
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the side, avoiding her piercing gaze. “Maybe. I don’t know.”
The air between them grew thicker, with unspoken emotions. Torrie’s frustration and Eddie’s indifference created a palpable tension. Torrie’s fingers paused mid-motion with the flower crown, her face a mask of frustration and hurt.
The Eden Flowers glowed softly. Their light cast long shadows that danced across their faces. The once-comforting glow now seemed to highlight the distance growing between them.
Torrie finally broke the silence, her voice quiet but firm. “If you’re not interested in seeing what’s different, then...” Her voice ceded down
 “why are you even here?”

-o-

The moonlight pierced through the dense canopy of the Deep Glaive, casting jagged patterns across the forest floor. Twisted vines and ancient trees loomed like sentinels, their gnarled forms seeming almost alive in the shifting light. The forest was oppressively silent, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant, haunting call of some unseen creature. 

Markus walked behind Catherine, his grip tight on Eddie’s flintlock rifle. The weapon was raised, its polished barrel glinting faintly in the pale light. Every whisper of movement sent his heart racing, his eyes darting toward every shadow. At the slightest rustle of a bush, the rifle twitched in his hands, his finger hovering dangerously close to the trigger. 

Catherine could hear the weapon rattling and flinging around, her staff resting lightly in her grip. Her expression was calm but sharp. She noticed Markus’s shoulders hunched, his steps jerky and uncertain, and the tension in his grip on the rifle. The unease was palpable, and the oppressive atmosphere was clearly getting to him. 

“Markus,” she said softly, breaking the silence with an even tone, “you’re holding that thing like we’re about to be ambushed by an army of bandits.” 

Markus shot her a glance, his voice tense. “Feels like we might be. This place... it’s not normal. I feel like something’s watching us.” He turned sharply at another rustling sound, aiming the rifle toward the underbrush. It was just a gust of wind stirring the leaves. 

Catherine stopped for a moment, letting her staff tap the ground lightly. “You’re going to give yourself a heart attack before we even find the Artefact.” She smiled, trying to inject a bit of levity. “Besides, I don’t think Eddie would appreciate you wasting all his precious gunpowder on small critters.” 

Markus lowered the rifle but kept it ready. “Easy for you to joke, ma’am! You’ve got magic if something happens. I’ve got only this—and it’s not exactly comforting.” He gave the rifle a wary look as if it might betray him at any moment. 

She stepped closer, her voice quiet but steady. “We’ll be fine. I’ve been through worse, believe me. And I promise you won’t be facing it alone if anything comes at us.” 

Markus glanced at her, the tension in his jaw easing slightly. “Alright,” he muttered. “But I’m still keeping this thing ready.” 

They continued deeper into the forest. The oppressive silence seemed to press in even closer, the darkness growing thicker. Catherine kept her senses sharp, but she made a mental note to keep talking—it seemed to keep Markus from completely unravelling. 

“You know,” she began, her tone conversational, “I used to visit Eddie’s home a lot when he was younger. We’d go adventuring in old ruins, exploring caves and abandoned barns. I thought I was pretty brave back then. But this? An illusory forest with who-knows-what lurking around? A first for me.” 

Markus glanced at her, his face pale. “Really? That must have been something.” 

Catherine nodded with a reminiscent smile. “It was. Eddie used to love going off-trail, never sticking to the safe paths. He was always adventurous, seeking new experiences, no matter the danger. We’d found ourselves in trouble countless times, but Eddie always seemed to enjoy the thrill of it. His older brother Alfred and I often had to help him out of those scrapes.” 

Markus swallowed hard, his nerves evident. “Eddie... he seems different now. He doesn’t seem like the same person.” 

Catherine’s smile faded slightly as she looked at Markus. “Different? How so?” 

Markus took a deep breath, his voice trembling slightly. “Well, there’s a reason for that. Back at the academy, a kid named Davies heavily bullied me. I wasn’t as adept at magic as the others, so I was an easy target. Eddie was always my friend because he didn’t quite fit in. He’d spend time with me instead of those other guys.” 

Markus paused, his eyes reflecting the dim light. “One day, when Davies was particularly brutal, Eddie was there. He was impulsive, as he always was, and he challenged Davies to a duel. None of us knew how it would end. Davies didn’t take Eddie seriously, but during the duel, Eddie accidentally scarred Davies’ face. It was a mess, and Eddie got expelled from the academy.” 

Catherine’s expression shifted from curiosity to shock and sympathy. “I had no idea. Eddie never spoke about it in detail. I’ve always wondered why he seemed so distant.” 

Markus nodded, his gaze dropping. “It was a turning point for him. He became cold and withdrawn after that. It’s like he lost something important to him.” 

Catherine sighed, her heart heavy with the weight of newfound understanding. “I wish I had known. I might have been able to help him see past it and rekindle his love for magic. I hope that’s still possible.” </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 9E</Title>
            <Text>Eddie pushed open the familiar creaking door of his dorm room, the weight of the day clinging to him like a shroud. Stepping inside, he was greeted by the soft snores emanating from Will's side of the room. A sliver of a smile touched Eddie's lips – for once, obliviousness seemed a blessing.
He knew Will would understand the need for Eddie to have some quiet time, some space to steel himself for the trials that awaited them. With a sigh, Eddie moved towards his desk, the worn leather surface a familiar anchor in the storm of emotions brewing within him.
Reaching for his bag, a worn canvas holdall that had seen its fair share of adventures, Eddie unzipped it with a practiced ease. Inside lay the tools of his former trade – the vials, the herbs, the arcane scribblings that spoke of a life he could no longer fully embrace. The magic that once flowed through his veins was now a distant memory, a bittersweet echo of his past.
But even without magic, Eddie wasn't powerless. He rummaged through the bag, his fingers brushing against the smooth surface of his jade ring, a potent symbol of his heritage. It wouldn't grant him spells or bend the elements to his will, but it held a potent alchemical concoction, a last gift from his mentor, Catherine Angelina. A failsafe, a desperate measure for a desperate time.
Beside the ring lay his trusty Airpen wand, a relic from a bygone era. It wouldn't cast spells anymore, but its craftsmanship was undeniable, a testament to a time when magic and alchemy intertwined. It was a symbol, a reminder of the ingenuity that resided within him, the spark of innovation that refused to be extinguished.
With a resolute breath, Eddie set about his task. The room, bathed in the soft amber glow of a desk lamp, became his sanctuary. The rhythmic gurgle of the cauldron on the low heat filled the air with a comforting aroma, a stark contrast to the turmoil within him. Around him, vials of shimmering liquids, each a testament to his alchemical knowledge, gleamed in the dim light.
He worked with practiced efficiency, his movements honed by years of experimentation under Catherine's tutelage. Each vial, each pouch filled with carefully chosen herbs, was a testament to his dedication, his unwavering determination to protect those he cared about. A vial of shimmering blue promised enhanced night vision, while another, a thick green concoction, offered a temporary barrier against physical harm.
A sense of grim satisfaction settled over him as he surveyed his work. These concoctions wouldn't grant him the raw power of a mage, but they were his tools, his equalizer in the face of the magic-wielding Black Hand. They were a testament to his ingenuity, a promise to fight, a vow to bring Ashley and the others home.
Across the room, Will slumbered peacefully, his breathing a steady counterpoint to the storm brewing within Eddie. A pang of envy, a flicker of longing for the innocence of sleep, washed over him. But it was a fleeting emotion, quickly extinguished by the burning resolve in his chest. He would face whatever darkness awaited them, with or without magic. He would be their shield, their protector, a silent guardian in a world filled with chaos.
With a final check of his supplies, Eddie secured them in a leather satchel and bandolier, making sure they were readily accessible. A cloak of determination settled on his shoulders, replacing the cloak of sorrow that had threatened to consume him. He would fight. He would protect. He would bring Ashley back.
With one last glance at Will's sleeping form, Eddie extinguished the lamp, plunging the room into darkness. Only the faint embers of the dying cauldron cast an ethereal glow. He lay down on his bed, the satchel within arm's reach, a silent sentinel against the encroaching night. The room, now a cocoon of anticipation and resolve, awaited the coming dawn, the start of their perilous journey into the darkness of the Undercity.
-o-
The weak morning light, struggling to pierce through dust-coated windows, illuminated the cluttered room. The remnants of a frantic night – empty vials, scattered notes, and the lingering scent of exotic herbs – painted a picture of hurried preparations. Sprawled across his bed, fully clothed but deeply asleep, lay Eddie. Outside, the rumble of an engine hinted at the wait that had begun. It was Will's task to rouse his friend from his slumber.
Creaking open the door, Will found Eddie in a state of blissful oblivion. A gentle &quot;Hey, Ed,&quot; escaped his lips, followed by a nudge that elicited no response. With a hint of amusement, Will escalated his efforts, giving Eddie a light shake.
&quot;Ed? Eddie! Wake up, dude!&quot; he whispered urgently.
A mumbled groan was the only reply at first, but then, eyelids fluttered open, revealing bleary blue eyes. Disorientation lingered for a moment before a flicker of recognition ignited in Eddie's gaze.
&quot;Huh? What time is it?&quot; he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.
Will glanced at his watch, the urgency in his voice tempered by a touch of understanding. &quot;It's almost go-time. You totally crashed, man.&quot;
Eddie bolted upright, sending a clatter of empty vials cascading to the floor. A panicked look washed over his face as his gaze darted to the clock on his desk. &quot;Crap! You're right, I'm late! I'm so sorry. I was up all night with the concoction!&quot;
Will chuckled softly. &quot;Yeah, we figured as much.&quot; He watched with amusement as Eddie scrambled to gather his scattered tools and potions, stuffing them haphazardly into his satchel and bandolier.
&quot;No biggie, dude, relax! We just need to roll out,&quot; Will reassured him.
&quot;I didn't mean to make everyone wait,&quot; Eddie mumbled apologetically, shoving a vial into his bandolier with more force than necessary.
&quot;Hey, no sweat. We all get it. We all know how important your work is,&quot; Will said, leaning casually against the doorframe. &quot;But you also need to take care of yourself. We need you in top form today.&quot;
A sheepish grin spread across Eddie's face. &quot;Yeah, you're right.&quot; With a sigh of finality, he zipped up his satchel and slung the bandolier across his chest. &quot;Just give me a sec to freshen up and grab my gear.&quot;
&quot;You know what? Take your time,&quot; Will surprised him. &quot;I'll wait here with you.&quot;
Eddie's eyebrows shot up. &quot;Really? What about the others?&quot;
Will shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;They can wait a bit longer. We're not going without you, man. Besides, we need you and your concoctions. You're the brains of this operation.&quot;
A warmth bloomed in Eddie's chest. &quot;Alright then,&quot; he said, a grateful smile playing on his lips. &quot;Thanks, Will. I appreciate it.&quot;
The early morning light, a pale sliver pushing through the grimy windows of Dorm 7, illuminated the worn stone steps as Eddie and Will descended. The air, crisp and cool, held the quiet promise of a new day, a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing within them.
As they walked, a shared, nervous energy crackled between them. It wasn't fear, exactly, but a tense anticipation that tightened Eddie's throat and made Will tap his foot incessantly.
&quot;Remember the first time we pulled something crazy like this?&quot; Will asked, a nostalgic grin tugging at the corner of his lips. &quot;Sneaking into the restricted section of the library? Feels like a lifetime ago.&quot;
Eddie chuckled, the sound laced with a hint of disbelief. &quot;Yeah, we thought we were so clever. Then, of course, there was Madeleine and Claire, ready to bust us flat.&quot;
&quot;That's when we met her,&quot; Will said, a playful glint in his eyes. &quot;Crazy how things work out, huh?&quot;
Eddie nodded, a silent smile gracing his features. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he agreed, the word heavy with unspoken emotions. Who knew that getting caught, red-handed and sheepish, would lead to the bond they shared now?
Will nudged him playfully. &quot;And I think it went a little deeper than just friends for you, buddy!&quot;
Eddie stumbled back, a blush creeping up his neck. &quot;What? No, I… I mean, she's just a good friend.&quot;
Will chuckled, clearly enjoying his friend's flustered state. &quot;Sure, sure. You're blushing, dude! Look at your face!&quot;
Eddie, defensive but unable to fully contain his smile, countered, &quot;I'm not! Besides, we have bigger fish to fry right now! Come on, dude, seriously!&quot;
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Will said, surrendering with a laugh, &quot;I'll let it slide… for now.&quot; He couldn't resist adding one final jab. &quot;So, what's with all the vials and that fancy cloak?&quot;
Eddie shifted his bandolier, the weight of his preparations a comforting reminder of his role. &quot;Well, these vials,&quot; he explained, gesturing to the satchel strapped across his chest, &quot;might come in handy during the raid. You never know when you might need a quick boost or a healing potion. And this cloak?&quot; He twirled the garment, revealing the dark underside that contrasted with the maroon university colors on the outside. &quot;Remember Ashley and her midnight escapades? She always managed to disappear into the shadows with that witch cloak of hers. I figured it might help me blend in and keep my gear hidden.&quot;
Will whistled in appreciation. &quot;Makes sense. Plus, you look kinda cool. Like a real alchemist, straight out of those old adventure stories.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, Will,&quot; Eddie said, a genuine smile warming his face. &quot;We need every edge we can get.&quot;
They reached the bottom of the staircase and emerged into the crisp morning air. A sigh of relief rippled through the group as they spotted Eddie and Will approaching the waiting car. Henry's restored vintage car, gleaming in the weak sunlight, served as their chariot into the unknown. The open door revealed Henry himself at the wheel, Jake and Jane occupying the middle seat, and a few other students crammed into the back. The atmosphere shifted, a shared determination settling over them like a cloak, as they prepared to head towards their destination – a daring raid into the heart of the Black Hand's lair. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 26 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stirred awake. Blinking against the soft sunlight that streamed through the stained-glass panels above. he found himself in a spacious, vibrant ward he didn’t recognise. The sunlight cast warm red, blue, and green hues across the room. It refracts off the intricate stained-glass windows. 

Rows of clean beds stretched out before him. Each of them is separated by shimmering silk curtains. The curtains caught the sunlight, creating a soft glow. The air was thick with an unsettling peace—too muted for comfort. Faint murmurs of incantations and the soft hum of magic filled the air. Healers, clad in flowing robes that ripple like water, moved gracefully from bed to bed. Their hands glowed as they worked. Their whispers of healing spells were gentle, but to Eddie, they stirred an unease deep inside him. 

His body felt heavy like he was sinking into the plush mattress beneath him. He glanced down at his chest. Bandages wrapped tightly around his chest. He could smell the faint, herbal scent of salves beneath the cloth. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose hospital robe. The memory of the Deep Glaive, Catherine, and the Nightingale Dragon flickered in his mind. He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the fight. 

The air seemed charged, but it wasn’t the comforting hum of everyday magic. This was a more profound, more potent force—a place of magic meant to heal, but not the kind Eddie was used to. He didn’t trust it. He glanced around warily, trying to shake off the lingering fog from his blackout. Where was he? And what had these healers done to him while he was unconscious? 

Eddie looked around. He turned his head and noticed a small cupcake on the side table beside his bed. Beside it, a familiar little box rested, its lid slightly ajar. His heart lifted a little at the sight, recognising the playful touch. Three folded notes lay beside the cupcake, each written in distinct, familiar handwriting. 

He reached for the box first, lifting it open. Inside was his old wand, the worn wood smooth against his fingertips. Another note was tucked beneath it, the handwriting unmistakably his sister Torrie’s. He unfolded it and started reading: 

“Hey, figured you might want your ring back! Don’t worry, though—Dad said he’s buying a better one for me. ;) Take care of yourself, Eddie. Mom, Dad, Markus, and everyone at the Apothecary send their love.” 

Eddie couldn’t help but chuckle. The familiar warmth of Torrie’s humour worked its way through his lingering exhaustion. 

He turned the ring over in his hands. It was once an extension of himself, a part of who he was before... before everything changed. There was still a reluctance within him. He was hesitant about picking it back up, about returning to the world of Alchemy. But here it was, given back to him with a laugh as if it were no more than an old toy. 

Setting the note aside, Eddie reached for the second letter. The paper was thicker. The handwriting was unmistakably his father’s—precise, sharp, and severe. His stomach knotted as he unfolded it, already sensing the anger etched into every line. 

“Edward, 

I received word about your... escapade. I don’t know what possessed you to take my flintlock rifle into the woods. That rifle has been with me since before you were even born. And now? Snapped in half. Compartments missing. Irreparable. 

You’ve disappointed me, son. Not because of the rifle itself. But because you clearly didn’t think about the consequences of your actions. That rifle wasn’t just a tool; it was part of our family’s history. 

That said, I suppose I’m grateful you’re alive to tell the tale, as reckless as it was. For now, focus on recovering. When you’re ready, we’ll talk about this in person. 

Take care of yourself, Eddie. And please, for the love of all that’s good, think before you act next time. 

Dad” 

Eddie exhaled slowly, the weight of his father’s words settling heavily on his chest. His disappointment was palpable. Almost scalding, but beneath it, Eddie could feel the care. The quiet, stubborn love that his father had always struggled to express outright. It wasn’t a rejection but a stern reminder of the expectations he’d failed to meet. 

Eddie folded the letter carefully and placed it on the table. His gaze drifted back to the cupcake and the cheerful note from Torrie. The juxtaposition felt almost cruel. Her lighthearted encouragement alongside his father’s cutting words. 

His fingers go back to his ring. He traces the familiar etchings along the silver bands. Memories swirling in the back of his mind. He set the wand down momentarily, leaning back into the pillows, and scanned the room. The ward was quiet, save for the occasional hum of healers moving in the distance. He was alone. 

The silence gave him space to think, and for a moment, he wondered what had brought him here. The memory of the Nightingale Fox lingered along with the raw feeling of casting magic after all this time. He had acted out of desperation, but somewhere beneath the fear, something else had sparked. Something he’d thought he’d lost. 

Eddie carefully swung his legs over the edge of the bed, testing his strength as his feet touched the cool floor. His chest ached under the bandages. Every movement sent a throb of discomfort through his body, but he couldn’t stay still. The cupcake in his hand was half-eaten, and Torrie’s playful note lingered in his thoughts. Giving him a slight sense of determination. He needed to move, even if just for a moment. 

He stood slowly, wobbling slightly as his body adjusted to the weight of his injuries. His hands instinctively reached for the bedside table for balance. He considered calling for help for a moment, but something stopped him. Maybe the stubborn part of him didn’t want to appear weak. Or perhaps the curiosity was starting to stir again after so long. Either way, Eddie breathed and straightened his back as much as the bandages would allow. 

The surrounding ward was more prominent than he initially thought. Rows of beds stretching into the distance, some occupied, others empty. Light streamed in through the high, stained-glass windows. It casts colourful patterns on the white stone floor below. The place had a serene beauty, but something about the faint hum of magic in the air made him uneasy. 

Eddie took a few tentative steps. His body protested with each one, but he pushed through the discomfort. His curiosity tugged him forward. He passed by the shimmering curtains separating his ward section from the others. The soft whisper of healers casting spells and tending to their patients blended with the sounds of his own footfalls. 

He stopped at one window, gazing out over a courtyard filled with Lumina flowers, their pale glow illuminating the garden. The same flowers had kept the Nightingale Fox at bay. His mind drifted back to that encounter, and he shivered slightly, remembering how the creature had looked at him, its gaze almost respectful. 

The air was peaceful here, yet Eddie couldn’t shake the feeling that he was standing on a threshold. He had touched magic again after all these years. The thought stirred a mix of emotions. Fear, guilt, and a flicker of something he hadn’t felt in a long time: hope. 

A soft voice interrupted his thoughts before he could dwell on it too long. “You’re up already? Shouldn’t you be resting?” 

Eddie shifted awkwardly as the young healer turned toward him. “I, um,” he began, smiling, “I wanted to go for a coffee. Do you know where the cafeteria is?” 

The healer’s expression softened, though a concern flickered in her eyes. “Coffee?” she repeated gently, her tone compassionate yet firm. “You’ve just regained consciousness and already thinking of coffee?” 

Eddie chuckled nervously, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, well... I’m not great at staying in bed. Thought a walk and some coffee might help clear my head.” 

The healer stepped closer. Her gaze was now more assessing as she glanced at the bandages peeking under his robe. 

“I understand you want to feel more like yourself, but your body’s still healing. You need rest.” Her voice was warm. As if she’d dealt with patients like Eddie before—restless, eager to escape the confines of recovery. “The wounds you sustained were severe. And while you’re in good hands, overexerting yourself could set you back.” 

Eddie nodded, feeling a bit sheepish. “Right... I guess I’m not great at sitting still.” 

She smiled, a soft, encouraging smile. “I understand. How about this—I’ll show you to the cafeteria, but only if you promise to take it slow. Your body needs time to recover. Even a short walk could tire you out more than you realise.” 

Eddie offered a more genuine smile. “Sure.” 

The healer gently touched his shoulder, guiding him to the door. “Just remember,” she added kindly, “healing takes more than physical recovery. Give yourself time, both body and mind. You’ve been through a lot.” 

As they reached the door, she nodded down the corridor. “The cafeteria is just down the hall. If you start feeling lightheaded, come back here immediately. Don’t push yourself too hard, alright?” 

“Thanks,” Eddie said, his smile tinged with gratitude. 

As he made his way down the hall, the healer’s words lingered in his mind. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t just physically healing. Something deeper was shifting, and maybe—just maybe—he needed to give that the time it deserved, too. 

Eddie made his way down the bright hallway toward the cafeteria. Each step felt like a minor victory. The soft colours of the walls wrapped around him like a comforting embrace while the enchanted sconces flickered with a warm, golden glow that seemed to dance in tune with his heartbeat. 

As he walked, he couldn’t help but admire the whimsical art hanging in shifting frames. A painting nearby showed a vibrant garden, with flowers blooming with each passing moment. The bird flitted joyfully from branch to branch, a delightful reminder of the magic surrounding him. 

To his right, large arched windows opened up to the courtyard. He paused for a moment, captivated by the lush oasis outside. The vibrant flowers danced in the gentle breeze. The serene greenery provided a backdrop to the laughter of patients soaking in the sun. Benches beckoned to those seeking respite, creating a tranquil haven amidst the busyness of life. 

As he continued, the soft echo of footsteps accompanied him, weaving through the comforting hum of conversation. The atmosphere buzzed with a sense of purpose and warmth. Magic infused the walls, which pulsed like a heartbeat. 

As he rounded a corner, he could smell the aroma of freshly brewed herbal teas and baked goods urging him onward. The sounds of vibrant chatter and laughter grew louder. It felt like he was approaching a gathering of kindred spirits—a heartwarming community sharing not just food but connection. 

Finally, he reached the cafeteria entrance, taking a moment to gather himself. With a deep breath, he stepped inside, ready to embrace whatever awaited him in this lively space.

            <Title>Chapter 2E</Title>
            <Text>The tension exploded into action as the battle ensued in the narrow hallway, echoing with the swift movement of bodies and the crackling of magic. The tallest figure—still a looming, silent presence—stepped back, seemingly content to watch as the rest of the hooded figures moved into action. The air grew thick with anticipation as Walther and the female figure lunged forward.
Walther was quick, his motions controlled and efficient. With a barely noticeable flick of his hand, he muttered an incantation under his breath. The magic surged from him, cutting through the air with an almost imperceptible hum. Sharp, razor-edged wind slashed toward Eddie, Will, and Ashley. It was a cutting spell—swift and silent, intended to carve through flesh and bone.
Will, however, reacted just as fast. His electric guitar was still slung across his back, but he didn’t need to reach for it—his fingers danced across the neck, strumming a quick, powerful chord that resonated with magic. A shimmering barrier of vibrant energy flared to life in front of them, humming as it absorbed the slicing wind. The spell collided with the barrier, and though the force of it shook Will, the shield held firm, scattering the sharp edges harmlessly to the sides.
The female figure wasn’t as interested in magic, but her weapon was no less dangerous. She lunged at Ashley, a dagger gleaming in the dim light, aiming for a lethal strike. Ashley faltered, just for a second, her instincts thrown off guard by the speed of the attack. But that moment was enough.
Before the dagger could reach her, Eddie’s hand shot out, instinctively reaching for the knowledge he had spent months mastering. He whispered a quick incantation, his mind focused on a simple but effective alchemical solution. A burst of compressed air shot from his hand, a blast of force that sent the female figure stumbling back, her balance disrupted. The dagger slipped from her grasp, clattering to the ground with a sharp, metallic ring. She skidded a few feet away, momentarily thrown off.
The hallway was now alive with a low hum of magic and tension, their every move a dance of attack and defense. Eddie, Will, and Ashley stood together, their backs against the wall, adrenaline surging through their veins. Walther’s eyes flicked toward them, his expression unreadable behind the hood, but the glint of determination in his gaze was unmistakable.
The silence that followed was thick, almost suffocating, broken only by the faint hum of magic crackling in the air and the soft thrum of their hearts.
The female figure recovered quickly, her eyes narrowing as she scanned Ashley, then Eddie. She moved with purpose, her movements predatory, ready to strike again. Walther, too, was poised, his stance calm, yet dangerous.
Eddie felt his heart hammering in his chest, every instinct screaming at him to keep fighting, to protect his friends. But he also knew this wasn’t just about magic or strength. It was about survival. And right now, he and his friends had to outwit these attackers, or they wouldn’t make it through the night.
Eddie took a deep breath, focusing on the compressed air still swirling around his mind, ready to use it again if needed. Will’s fingers twitched, preparing another defensive spell. And Ashley, though her breath was shallow from the near miss with the dagger, stood tall, ready to support her friends.
The fight was escalating quickly. The female figure lunged again, her movements swift and predatory, a blur of motion as she aimed for Ashley with the dagger. Walther, too, was relentless. His hands wove through the air as he cast more cutting spells, his intent to bring them down with precision. The air was thick with magic, crackling with every arcane surge.
Will’s electric guitar thrummed with power, its enchanted resonance holding the line, keeping Eddie and Ashley protected behind a shimmering barrier. The shield pulsed with each strike, but the pressure was mounting. The attacks were relentless, and the air was thick with tension.
But Eddie’s mind was working quickly. His eyes darted around, calculating. And then, he saw it: the window beside the female figure, offering him an opportunity. Without missing a beat, he barked at Ashley, “Open the window!”
Ashley hesitated only for a moment before she dashed forward, her staff raised. She thrust it toward the window, and with a sharp incantation, the window flung open with a creak.
Eddie didn’t waste a second. He focused, drawing on the power of alchemy, and with a quick motion, he transmuted the rain above into sharp ice. A storm of razor-sharp icicles formed in an instant, floating in the air like deadly projectiles.
“Now!” Eddie shouted.
Ashley raised her staff, concentrating. With a fluid motion, she directed the ice into a concentrated barrage, launching the jagged icicles with pinpoint accuracy. They whizzed through the air like a storm of frozen bullets, striking the female figure and Walther in rapid succession. Each hit was sharp and precise, piercing through their cloaks and striking with brutal force.
Walther staggered back, a pained grunt escaping his lips as ice pierced through his shoulder and leg. The female figure wasn’t any luckier, an icicle embedding itself deep into her side. She gasped, her breath turning to mist in the cold air, and staggered to her knees, clutching her wound.
The hall was silent for a moment, save for the soft hiss of rain outside. The three of them stood in the aftermath of the storm, adrenaline coursing through their veins.
But the tallest figure—still standing, unfazed—smiled coldly. He stepped forward, his posture as calm and controlled as before. “Impressive,” he said in a low, measured tone. “You’ve defeated both of my disciples.”
Eddie, Will, and Ashley stood together, their hands tight around their weapons, ready to face whatever came next. Will’s guitar still hummed with protective magic, his stance steady. Ashley’s staff was raised, her expression focused. Eddie, his wand gripped tightly, felt the weight of the moment settle over him. This was the final test—the last obstacle.
The tall figure’s gaze flicked between the three of them, and though his smile remained, it was as cold and calculating as ever.
But there was no going back now. They had already crossed the line. Eddie took a breath and squared his shoulders, ready for whatever this mysterious figure would throw at them next.
The final confrontation was at hand.
The tallest figure stepped forward, his calm demeanor shifting into something far more dangerous. His cold smile grew wider, more predatory, as he lifted one hand, fingers splayed like the claws of a beast. The air around them grew still, as if even the world itself was holding its breath.
“Enough games,” he said, his voice a low rumble that echoed in the hall.
With a snap of his fingers, the very air crackled with energy. Eddie, Will, and Ashley felt a strange charge in the air, a tingling sensation that prickled their skin like static before it became something far worse. The tall figure’s arm snapped forward, and in an instant, a massive bolt of pure, concentrated thunder shot from his outstretched hand.
The sound was deafening, a crack that split the air like a thunderclap at point-blank range. The blast hit them all at once, a violent surge of energy that felt as if it could tear them apart. Eddie’s body was lifted off the ground as the bolt coursed through him, searing his flesh, burning him from the inside out. He felt the electricity tear through his muscles, a sharp, painful convulsion before his entire body went limp, his muscles locking up.
Will screamed as the lightning struck him, the electric current coursing through his body, burning the skin on his arms and chest. His guitar rang out with an eerie, discordant note before the protective barrier around them flickered and shattered, the shielding magic overwhelmed by the sheer force of the attack.
Ashley cried out, her staff slipping from her fingers as the lightning hit her squarely in the chest. Her body spasmed violently, and she was thrown backward, crashing against the wall with a sickening thud. Her vision blurred as the current ravaged her, and she struggled to breathe, her limbs twitching from the residual power coursing through her.
The force of the thunderclap left them all reeling, unable to stand, unable to move. Their bodies were singed and burned, the air thick with the smell of charred flesh and ozone. Eddie’s vision swam in and out of focus as he tried to steady himself, but the pain was overwhelming. He could barely hold onto consciousness as the world around him spun.
Will’s voice was barely a whisper, hoarse and strained. “Eddie... Ashley...”
But his words were lost in the deafening roar of his own thoughts. His body felt like it was on fire, the burning heat of the thunderclap gnawing at his nerves. The pain, the shock, the exhaustion—they were too much. His eyelids grew heavy, his head lolling forward as darkness encroached at the edges of his vision.
Ashley lay slumped against the wall, her breathing ragged, her eyes fluttering closed. She tried to reach for her staff, but the strength simply wasn’t there. Her body refused to obey her mind, her limbs limp and heavy. The storm of pain was too much for her to bear.
Eddie’s hand twitched as he tried to raise his wand, but it fell from his grip, the world around him growing dim. The tall figure loomed over them, his face still calm, his eyes cold as he watched their suffering.
“You thought you could fight this,” the figure said, his voice a whisper, almost bored. “You were never meant to win.”
The three of them were on the ground, their bodies barely able to respond, their minds fogging as the darkness took hold.
For a moment, it seemed as though the world had ended, leaving only the cold silence of the tall figure’s victory.
And then, just as the last of Eddie’s consciousness slipped away, a faint whisper of hope reached him—a faraway voice, a spark in the dark, calling out. But it was too late.
Everything went black.
-o-
The world around Eddie was a haze of smoke, fire, and pain. Every breath felt like it came from a distance, as if his body were no longer his own. The sharp scent of burnt flesh still clung to the air, the echo of the tall figure’s thunder spell lingering in the space like the last reverberation of a storm. Eddie’s eyelids flickered, too heavy to stay open, but he fought the darkness, the pull of unconsciousness, trying to claw his way back into the world.
He could barely focus, but through the haze, he saw movement. A figure—Madeleine. Her door had opened, the light from her apartment spilling into the hallway. She stepped out, concern written across her face as she saw the chaos unfolding around her.
“Eddie? What’s going on? Are you alright—”
Her voice was cut off before she could finish. Eddie’s heart lurched as the tall figure, his movements as fluid as death itself, raised his wand in a swift, practiced motion. With a flick of his wrist, a spell shot forward, and Madeleine collapsed instantly, her body going limp in the air before she crumpled into the arms of the tall figure.
Eddie’s mind screamed, but his body refused to respond. His vision was spinning, the world around him distorted. He tried to call out her name, but his voice was weak, barely a rasp. The ground beneath him felt far too distant, like he was sinking into the abyss. But, somehow, he caught a glimpse of the tall figure—he was carrying Madeleine’s unconscious body.
The sounds of the world were muffled, distorted by the roar of blood in Eddie’s ears. Walther and the female figure were standing nearby, seemingly healed, their wounds from the earlier fight no longer visible.
“Do we take the boy too?” the female figure asked, her voice colder than the night air.
Eddie’s heart skipped a beat. The boy?
“Leave him,” Walther spat, his voice dripping with venom. “He’ll come for her. Let Lord Raven see the boy’s power himself. He will be pleased.”
The tall figure’s smile was unsettling as he nodded, his eyes cold, detached. “Very well. Let’s get going.”
Eddie’s heart was hammering in his chest, his thoughts a blur of panic and rage. He couldn’t let them take Madeleine—he couldn’t let them get away with this. Fighting against his body, which felt like lead, Eddie tried to push himself up. Every movement was a struggle, his limbs shaking, his head spinning, but he wouldn’t give up. He couldn’t. He had to—
Madeleine.
With what little strength he had left, Eddie crawled toward them, dragging himself inch by inch across the floor. His vision was swimming, but he could see the tall figure turning to leave, Madeleine’s body limp in his arms. His breath came in ragged gasps as he called out her name, his voice raw with desperation.
“Madeleine…!”
His fingers scraped the floor as he reached out, trying to grab hold of anything that might stop them. He could hear his own voice, cracking with fury as he cursed Walther, the traitor, for what he’d done.
“You fucking traitor Walther! You’ll pay for this!” Eddie screamed once more
Walther’s eyes flicked toward him, and in an instant, his expression turned to one of cold amusement. He stepped forward, his eyes narrowing as he raised his hand. “Enough.”
With a quick movement, Walther delivered a swift blow to the back of Eddie’s head. The force was enough to send Eddie crashing back to the ground, the world going black once more.
The last thing he heard before he lost consciousness again was Walther’s voice, distant and mocking, “Sleep well, Welton. You’ve made things far more interesting.”
And then, there was nothing.
-o-
Eddie’s vision was blurred, the world around him a hazy swirl of faces and shadows. He could feel the cool touch of hands trying to steady him, voices murmuring in concern, but he couldn't focus on any of it. The voices were distant, like they were coming from a faraway place, and none of them mattered. Not now.
His body was broken, his mind foggy with pain, but all that consumed him was one thought: Madeleine.
She was still out there. They had taken her. They’ve taken her.
He limped forward, ignoring the concerned whispers of the butlers and tenants around him. People tried to stop him, to offer help, but he pushed them away, his limbs moving on their own. He bumped into walls, the cold stone scraping against his skin, but he barely registered the impact. His only focus was the path ahead—the hall, the door, the streets beyond.
He didn’t care about the others, even as Will and Ashley began to stir, groaning in pain behind him. He couldn’t afford to look back. He couldn’t let them distract him. All that mattered was getting to her.
His pace quickened, the cobblestones beneath his boots slick with rain, but he barely noticed. The cold rain was soaking through his clothes, but it did nothing to slow him down. His heart was hammering in his chest, his breath ragged. He couldn’t think straight. His mind was clouded with panic, with fear for Madeleine. The pain of his body—of the burns and the exhaustion—was secondary.
Finally, Eddie reached the front of the apartment complex, his eyes scanning the street. The world was wet, dark, the rain falling in sheets, but he couldn’t stop himself. He searched desperately, frantic, his gaze darting from one corner to the next.
And then, through the downpour, he saw it.
An enclosed truck, parked just ahead. The back door was barely open, but even through the rain, Eddie caught a glimpse of something he recognized—a flash of red hair. His heart skipped a beat.
Madeleine.
Without thinking, he pushed forward, his legs aching, burning with every step. The truck began to move, slowly at first, but then it picked up speed, the wheels turning in the rain-soaked streets. Eddie’s breath came in ragged gasps as he sprinted after it, the world around him blurring with every step.
He wasn’t fast enough.
The truck was pulling away, the distance growing between them. Eddie's legs felt like they were made of lead, his body screaming in pain, but still he ran. He pushed himself harder, ignoring the exhaustion, the burning in his chest, the searing pain in his limbs. But no matter how fast he ran, he couldn’t close the gap. The truck was too far ahead.
His feet slipped on the wet cobblestones, his body crashing to the ground with a sickening thud. The impact jarred through his skull, and for a moment, everything went dark. But then he could feel the cold rain, hear the distant rumble of thunder, and the truck continued to pull away.
His breath hitched, and tears, cold from the rain, mixed with the salt of his own. Eddie's heart shattered as he realized the truth.
Eddie’s legs buckled beneath him, his body too exhausted to keep going. His feet, slick with the rain, slid out from under him. His breath hitched painfully in his chest as he crashed to the cold cobblestones, the hard impact rattling his skull. He barely felt it—the pain in his body, the cuts and burns from the earlier battle, seemed distant, muted. All he could feel, all he could think about, was the crushing weight of failure.
His hand scraped the wet stone, desperate to push himself up, to keep going, but his fingers felt like they were made of glass. His muscles screamed in protest, his body soaked in cold rain and searing pain, but it was nothing compared to the pain inside. His mind was on fire, the helplessness gnawing at him like a wild beast.
The truck was moving farther away, and Madeleine was still inside. She was gone. They had taken her.
Eddie’s breath came in ragged, broken gasps, his chest tight with panic. He tried to scream, to call her name, but the words wouldn’t come. His throat was raw, the tears stinging his eyes mixing with the cold rain that fell relentlessly, as if the world itself was punishing him.
His legs twitched, his hands trembling violently as he tried to push himself up again, but his body refused to obey. His vision blurred, not from the rain or the dizziness, but from the overwhelming, suffocating grief that twisted and tore through him. The truck, her, the one person he promised to protect—he had failed her.
His mind spiraled, each thought a jagged shard of self-loathing, each heartbeat a reminder of his failure. He slammed his fist against the ground, the wet stone slick and unforgiving beneath him. The feeling of helplessness spread like poison through his veins. His chest caved in with the weight of it.
He felt the tears fall—hot, bitter. They mixed with the rain, lost in the downpour, but they were there. He couldn’t stop them. His breath broke in sobs, ragged and broken, his whole body shaking with the force of his anguish. The world around him felt impossibly large, cold, and empty, and he was so small. So helpless.
He had failed.
The truck was gone now. Madeleine was gone.
And Eddie, soaked to the bone, trembling in the rain, felt the last of his strength slip away. His body gave in, collapsing against the stones as his sobs turned into quiet, helpless breaths. The cold of the world seeped into him, and in that moment, Eddie felt as though everything had gone dark.
-o-
The rain fell in sheets, an endless, mournful downpour, as Eddie lay there on the cobblestones, his body shaking with every sob, every breath ragged and broken. He barely noticed the figure approaching through the rain, the rhythmic tapping of her boots soft against the harsh sounds of the storm. The umbrella above her kept her dry, but the rest of her was almost ghostly, her figure shadowed and cloaked, the black fabric of her cloak hiding her face, making her seem distant, a part of the rain itself.
She stopped just in front of Eddie, and for a moment, all he could hear was the sound of the storm and his own desperate gasps. The umbrella’s edge hovered just above his head, and he felt a warmth he didn’t expect. It was like the air around her had shifted, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he was no longer alone.
&quot;You need help,&quot; the lady’s voice was soft, but insistent, carrying through the heavy rain. It wasn’t commanding, but it felt like a lifeline, one that Eddie, in his disoriented state, wanted nothing to do with. He didn’t care about help. He didn’t care about anything. Not right now.
&quot;I said leave me alone!&quot; Eddie growled, his voice hoarse and bitter, still struggling to keep himself from falling apart completely. He pushed himself away from her, but he didn’t have the strength to rise. His eyes were bloodshot, red from crying, and when they met hers, they didn’t soften.
But the lady didn’t pull away. Instead, she stepped closer, kneeling down to be on his level. Her hand, gloved but warm, reached out, as if offering him something he didn’t know he needed.
&quot;You don't understand,&quot; he spat, his throat burning with the weight of his words. &quot;You don’t know shit about what’s going on, so just go away.&quot;
The woman didn’t back away. She took a step closer, tilting her umbrella to shield him from the rain. There was something in her eyes, something steady and unwavering. She wasn’t deterred. Instead, her voice took on a slightly amused, yet offended tone.
“How could I not know you, Eddie Welton?” she asked, with a slight chuckle. “I’ve known you since before you were born.”
That stopped him.
The words reached through the fog of his pain. Before he was born?
Eddie blinked, his vision clouded with confusion and tears. He lifted his gaze to the woman’s face, trying to make sense of it all. The rain hit his face, stinging, but it couldn’t hide the fact that something in the woman’s posture was too familiar. There was a strange, almost imperceptible pull, like a thread tugging him back to his childhood, to memories he hadn’t realized he’d forgotten.
She tilted her head slightly, and with a fluid motion, she pushed back the hood of her cloak, revealing sharp, pointed ears that gleamed in the dim light of the streetlamps. Her features—slightly angular, ethereal—had the unmistakable sharpness of an Elf, and in that moment, everything fell into place. The unmistakable glint of recognition washed over Eddie’s face as his mind cleared, the pieces finally clicking into place.
His heart, still pounding with the weight of his failure, stilled for a moment. His eyes widened.
“…Catherine?” Eddie breathed, almost in disbelief. The name felt strange, but it was right. There was no mistaking her now.
The woman smiled softly, the corners of her lips curling as she saw the shock on Eddie’s face. “Well, it’s about time you recognized me,” she said, her voice warm, though still with that playful undertone. “I see the years haven’t exactly been kind to you.”
Eddie’s head spun. Catherine… “Catherine the Wanderer”, The Master Alchemist, who had always been just a distant name, a shadow in his family’s stories. She had always been so far away, so unreachable—until now. And yet here she was, standing in front of him, her red coat vivid against the gray, rain-slicked world.
&quot;Catherine...&quot; he repeated, the name tasting strange on his tongue, unsure if he was dreaming or if this was truly happening.
&quot;Yes, it’s me,&quot; she said with a slight smile, a warmth in her voice that he had almost forgotten.
Eddie didn’t have the energy to say anything else. His emotions, already raw, surged once more as he looked up at her, his face a mask of disbelief and confusion. How could she be here? How could she be the one to find him, after everything he had just gone through?
But Catherine simply reached out, gently placing her hand on his shoulder, offering him the kind of comfort he hadn’t known he needed until now.
&quot;Come with me, Eddie,&quot; she said softly, her voice like the calm in the eye of a storm. </Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 5 V2</Title>
            <Text>The darkly lit apothecary was filled with the smell of herbs and oils. Eddie pushed the broom over the hardwood floor, the quiet, rhythmic swish reverberating in the motionless store, a lonely sound in a still universe. The shopfront was bathed in lantern light and a candle's subtle dance on the counter as daylight faded.
He set the broom aside and grabbed a polishing cloth from under the counter, attacking a stubborn smudge on the front window with more force than was necessary. The glass groaned under the pressure.
“Old man and his riddles,” he muttered, the annoyance simmering just below the surface. “Why can’t he just say what he means for once?”
He grumbled on, his voice a low counterpoint to the squeak of the cloth on the glass. “Alchemists and their love for fables and metaphors. Everything’s always wrapped in some convoluted story. ‘The falcon that wouldn’t fly’ or ‘the fire that wouldn’t burn’—what does any of that even mean?” He could almost picture his father’s amused smile at his irritation, which only made him more irritable.
Alchemy wasn't just mixing potions; his father had drilled that into him. “It’s about understanding the essence of things, the truth hidden beneath the surface,” Robert would say with that vague, mystical wave of his hand. But to Eddie, all that poetic phrasing just complicated things. Alchemists were known eccentrics, speaking in riddles that only made sense to them, making it one of the hardest branches of magic to master.
“Just tell me what I need to do,” Eddie grumbled under his breath, pausing to look out at the cobblestone street. The last of the townspeople were heading home, tiny figures bustling about, unaware of the philosophical turmoil happening behind this very window. Heaving a sigh, he resumed his scrubbing.
“If understanding allegories is what it takes to be a good alchemist,” Eddie said to his reflection with a half-hearted, bitter chuckle, “then I’m better off just sorting herbs.”
He tossed the cloth onto the counter, the weight of his father’s words lingering like a stone dropped into a still pond. Even if he didn’t understand the lesson, a part of him knew there was something important hidden in the cryptic message.
He glanced up at the shelves, curious. Dried herbs, tinctures, and little vials line the walls like troops waiting for a command. Everything had unfolded as a result of his father’s influence—his father’s enterprise, his father’s aspirations.
His father.
Eddie wiped his fingers on his face to erase the shadowy feeling. Mr. Welton was always a dreamer. He lived with serene conviction, never questioning his decisions and constantly encouraging him to fulfil his full potential. 
Eddie momentarily rested on the broom, wondering whether it was the bird metaphor should’ve meant. This morning, the Blue Songbird flew. However, his look conveyed an underlying emotion as he watched the bird fly into the sky.
It was as if his father had been waiting for Eddie to notice it, to see it as more than just a simple act of freeing a beloved bird. Perhaps it was a sign. A nudge, as Markus had put it. But what was Eddie supposed to do with it?
He shifted his gaze to the counter. The waning candlelight danced softly upon the grain of the wood. 
It stretches its elongated shadows across the gleaming surface of the wood. The apothecary was a small, tranquil refuge, yet it had transformed into a prison of his own design, its walls closing in around him.
Eddie saw a shadow as he swept the final shopfront window corner. Under the flickering gas light outside, everything seems odd. Looking up, his breath stopped in his chest
A hooded figure stared at the apothecary in the faint light of the gas lamp. Eddie tightened his grasp on the broom handle and slowed. Their stance was too steady and purposeful.
For a moment, Eddie attempted to ignore his sense of unease. It was late. Maybe a late-night wanderer? Is someone going home? Maybe they were fatigued and lost in thought.
He focused back on the sweeping, but the unease didn’t let up. There was something about the way the figure stood. The way their presence seemed to linger a little too long. Eddie’s eyes flickered back to the shadow beneath the lamplight.
The figure hadn’t moved.
Eddie’s pulse quickened, but he tried to push the feeling away. “Come on, get a grip, god damn it.” he muttered under his breath. He had enough to worry about—his father, the shop, Markus’s comment towards him, his own restless thoughts. But still, the figure remained. Silent and unmoving, casting a long shadow on the cobbled street.
Then, without warning, the figure began to move.
Slowly. Methodically. Each stride towards the shop was deliberate and calculated. Eddie's gut wrenched, heart accelerated. The figure vanished. it approached him directly.
Slowly. Methodically. Each stride towards the shop was deliberate and calculated. Eddie's gut wrenched, heart accelerated. 
Eddie realised the figure was a woman as it approached. Her dark cloak with a deep hood hid her face. He was mainly impressed by her crimson coat below. Red cloth peeping out from black, like a bloodstain in the night.
Stable, quiet footfall emanated from the lady. Her speed never slowed as she approached.
He told himself it was nothing. Just a passerby, maybe someone with a message or inquiry. But the way she moved, the cold air around her, it wasn’t normal. It felt... ominous.
The lady was now at the shop's doorway, a few feet away. Her black cloak flaps in the wind.
The lady raised her brass mahogany staff and tapped it gently against the front glass door. The sound echoed through the quiet shop, deliberate and unhurried—each tap as methodical as her approach.
Eddie hesitated, the broom still in his hand, his body tense, but he forced himself to breathe, to act normal. 
“I’m sorry,” Eddie finally said, his voice polite, though his unease tugged at his words. “We’re closed. We don’t serve customers at this hour.”
The Lady in Red Coat was unfazed. She remained motionless. Her eyes were fixated on Eddie through the glass, the night's shadows hiding her face. But not her frightening glint emerald eyes. Her chin rose slightly. She smiled, as if his reaction delighted her.
“How about an old friend?” she replied.
Her voice was smooth. It laces with an easy familiarity that sent a shiver down Eddie’s spine.
Eddie's heart jumped. An old friend? The words were cryptic. Who the hell is she? Someone from his past? A forgotten friend? Eddie doesn't recognise the figure.
A dozen names and faces sprang to his mind, but none suited the intriguing lady before him. The question made him choke on his breath. Does he know her?
Eddie froze. Her coldness lingered between them as she stared at him. He opened his mouth to speak. He wanted to remind her that it was late and he couldn't serve anybody. His instincts kept him back. Her words had an intangible pull that compelled him to allow her in and embrace it.
A sigh escaped his lips, the resistance fading like a fog lifting. “One more order it is,” He muttered to himself.
He turned the lights back on, lighting the apothecary softly. As he lifted the latch and pulled open the door, the storefront echoed its unlocking.
The Lady in Red Coat entered quietly. The hardwood floor creaked when her boots clicked. She studied the room with her glance without speaking. 
Eddie returned to the reception table. Leaning on the counter, he folded his hands and watched her. She exuded calm authority, like she knew something he didn't. 
Her black, silky cloak trailed after her like a shadow, its edges moving with a subtle charm. Eddie could now see her red coat—bright and brilliant against the dark, flowing softly over her legs and hinting at her exquisite figure—under the cloak. 
Her fingers brushed over a glass jar filled with shimmering blue powder. She touches lightly, testing its weight. She held a few fragile vials of rare tinctures and resins. Eddie noticed her deliberate, slow movements. She seemed in control. Eddie was uneasy about a skilled hand examining the potions and elixirs.
As she stopped by a shelf of dried sage and cinnamon sticks, her eyes flicked toward Eddie for the first time, meeting his gaze directly.
“You run quite an establishment here, Mr Welton,” she said, her voice soft, deep and yet cutting through the silence like a blade.
Eddie swallowed hard, reflexively standing himself, seeing the contrast between her grace and his slouching. The chamber seemed heavy as she approached, the apothecary's soft hum quieting. Her footsteps resonated like a pulse, infusing the air with an inexplicable energy that made it electric.
He stammered, his usual cheer faltering under her gaze. “How can I—”
But before he could finish, she raised a gloved hand, and the gracefulness of her movements struck him. “I have come seeking a matter of great significance,” she remarked elegantly.
“What... what are you looking for?” Eddie managed to ask, his heart racing as a mix of curiosity and apprehension bubbled within him.
The Lady in Red Coat approached, her eyes shining. “I am on a quest for that which is truly remarkable, a treasure that dances just beyond the reach of the mundane..” Her eyes scanned the shelves, examining the various vials and jars. “And I hold a firm belief that it may dwell within your very grasp.”
Her grin expanded, expressing enjoyment, but her eyes remained intense. “It appears I have stumbled upon the perfect place. Robert Welton is indeed a figure of some renown, yet my curiosity extends beyond merely his talents.” She approached, her demeanour changing gently as if she were surrounding a valuable information.
Eddie swallowed hard, feeling the tension in the air tighten like a drawn bowstring. “I—I don’t understand. What is it that you need?” he stammered, trying to keep his composure. The thought of secrets swirling in the depths of her cloaked figure made him uneasy. He could hear the distant sound of waves crashing against the shore, a reminder of the normalcy that felt like a world away.
“Perhaps you will soon,” she replied cryptically. The corners of her lips curled into a smile that sent another chill racing through him. “I find myself in possession of a venture that yearns for the deft hand of a master, and I am convinced that the Alchemist residing within these very walls possesses the skill I seek.”
The tension hung thick in the air as the Lady in the Red Coat continued to observe Eddie, a knowing glint in her eye that made him feel even more on edge. A slow smirk played on her lips as if she was savouring a delicious secret that only she could fully comprehend.
“I would like to place an order,” she proclaimed, her voice flowing with a measured grace. “I seek the fabled Elixir of the illustrious Philosopher’s Stone.”
Eddie’s heart sank at the mention of the fabled elixir. “There’s no such thing as the Elixir of the Philosopher’s Stone.” he stammered, his mind racing to process what she was asking. Even the existence of the Philosopher’s Stone was a long-standing myth, its origins shrouded in ambiguity and legend. “I’m sorry, but we don’t have it,” he said, trying to keep his tone polite but firm.
The Lady drew nearer, her gaze sharpening with a flicker of intrigue, as curiosity stirred within her heart. “Pray tell, what grants you such unwavering confidence in its nonexistence?”
“Because it’s just a myth,” Eddie replied, his voice trembling as uncertainty gnawed at him. “It’s never been proven to exist in any real form.”
“Is that indeed the case?” She pressed forth, her smile broadening.
Eddie nodded, feeling the heat rise to his cheeks. He wished he could stand taller, and appear more confident, but her presence felt overwhelming.
Then, without a flicker of gaze averted, the Lady drew nearer still. “Pray, Dost thou know who I verily am?”
Eddie froze, caught off guard by her question. He glanced at the intricate embroidery of her cloak, the vibrant red of her coat, the glimmer of her golden buttons, and the staff she held, which seemed to pulse with an aura of authority. As he took in the details, he felt a shiver run down his spine.
At that moment, everything clicked into place, the pieces of the puzzle coming together in a whirlwind of realisation. “You’re a Master Alchemist.”
As the tension in the air thickened, The Lady in Red Coat reached up and slowly lowered her hood. The dim light of the apothecary illuminated her features. It reveals a familiar face that makes Eddie’s heart skip a beat. Her short, bright red hair framed her face perfectly. Glinting like polished copper in the warm light. High cheekbones accentuated her fair skin, and her striking emerald green eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint.
“Catherine?” he exclaimed, his voice a mix of disbelief and confusion.
Her elvish ears peeked out from beneath her hair. It adds an ethereal quality to her already captivating appearance. She wore a mischievous smile. One that transformed the atmosphere from ominous to delightfully playful. “Surprise!” she said, her tone shifting. “Did you really think I was an assassin? Perchance just a very dramatic alchemist?”
Eddie blinked in realisation, laughter bubbling up despite the earlier tension. “I swear, every alchemist I’ve met has to act mysterious, shrouded in allegory and cryptic hints, I’m fucking done.”
Catherine chuckled, her eyes sparkling with humour. “It’s part of the job description, you know. How else shall we sustain the air of mystery that beckons us forth?”
Before he could respond, she stepped forward and enveloped him in a warm hug. “Look at you! You’ve grown so big! The last time I saw you, you were half this size!”
Eddie couldn’t help but laugh, the tension evaporating like mist in the morning sun. “I’m still the same old me, just a bit taller.”
“How unkind of thee to let slip the memory of your beloved aunt!” she teased, giving him a mock pout as she stepped back to assess him with a playful glint in her eyes.
As Catherine stepped back from the embrace, still chuckling at Eddie’s playful jab, the door to the apothecary swung open once more. In bounded Torrie, Eddie’s little sister, her curls bouncing with every step and her face alight with excitement.
“Catherine!” Torrie exclaimed, her voice full of delight as she practically launched herself into a hug.
“Well, well, if it isn’t my favourite niece!” Catherine announced with exaggerated flair, her light blue eyes twinkling with mischief. With a flourish, she spun Torrie around in a grand gesture before gently placing her back on the ground, tousling Torrie’s hair.
“You won’t believe it! I spotted Aunt Catherine’s carriage while I was heading home from Aella Academy!” Torrie jumped in, her excitement practically bubbling over. “So I caught a lift! Catherine totally said I could!”
“Torrie!” Eddie let out an exasperated groan, pinching the bridge of his nose. “You really shouldn’t—”
“And I totally did!” Torrie wrapped things up with a victorious grin. “Catherine even told me what to get for snacks later!” She made a face at Eddie, sticking her tongue out before sprinting towards the back room, her laughter echoing in the air behind her. “I’ll stash them in the kitchen!”
Catherine let out a laugh, her head shaking in disbelief. “She’s got more energy than a fire-breathing dragon on a rampage.”
Just as Eddie was about to respond, the door swung open once more, unveiling Mr. and Mrs. Welton.
Mrs. Welton’s eyes sparkled with delight at the sight of Catherine. “Catherine!” she called out, her voice filled with warmth and affection as she rushed forward to wrap her in a loving embrace.
Mrs. Welton stepped back, “You appear to have hardly aged a day, just as ever.” It’s utterly infuriating.
“That’s exactly why you hold the title of my favourite younger sister,” Catherine replied, her smile full of mischief. “I daresay you carry your seventy years with a grace that surpasses anyone I have ever encountered.”
Mrs. Welton rolled her eyes good-naturedly. “Flattery will get you nowhere, Cathy.”
“Oh, it always brought me treats when we were young,” Catherine replied with a playful tone.
As the two women shared their laughter, Mr. Welton drew near to Catherine, a grin spreading across his face. “Ah, Catherine! Still as keen as ever, I see.”
“And yet, here you are, still on your feet.” Catherine smiled, “It seems that alchemy is working its magic on your joints, Robert.” Catherine remarked with a playful lift of her eyebrow.
Mr. Welton chuckled. “Or maybe I’m just that stubborn.”
“Oh, do not be so humble. You were truly one of my most unforgettable apprentices,” Catherine remarked, a playful glint in her eye. “I recall the time you mishandled that levitation potion, almost sending the cauldron soaring through the ceiling.” She crossed her arms and fixed him with a pointed gaze, yet the corners of her mouth betrayed her with the hint of a smile. “And don’t think for a moment that I’m unaware you did it intentionally to catch Alyssa’s attention.”
Mr. Welton feigned innocence, shrugging his shoulders in mock surrender. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Oh, please.” Catherine rolled her eyes. “You orchestrated the explosion with such precision that she would come rushing to our aid. And do you know who had to clean up the mess afterward? Me!”
Mrs. Welton chuckled softly, her hand delicately covering her mouth. “Hold on, is that the reason the cauldron found itself lodged halfway into the ceiling?” I had always believed it to be merely one of his typical, awkward instances.”
“I had to make sure she noticed me somehow,” Mr. Welton admitted with a sheepish grin. “And it worked, didn’t it, Alyssa?” He glanced at Mrs. Welton, his expression softening.
“It did,” she confessed, a gentle smile gracing her lips. “Yet, you felt it necessary to explode the brewing room to capture my notice.”
Catherine let out a huff, though it was more amused than irritated. “You used me as your unwitting accomplice in your courtship shenanigans. The nerve!” She shook her head dramatically. “I should’ve charged you extra for those lessons.”
“And yet,” Mr. Welton said, his grin widening, “you still wrote me a glowing recommendation to the guild after I finished.”
Catherine waved a dismissive hand, though a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. “Only because I felt sorry for Alyssa. I figured she deserved a husband who could at least brew a half-decent potion without destroying half the brewing room.”
The playful banter between them drew laughter from Mrs. Welton, who nudged Catherine lightly. “Admit it, you’re proud of him. He turned out alright in the end.”
“Proud?” Catherine exclaimed with feigned outrage. “I felt a wave of relief wash over me at the thought of not having to contend with him once he had graduated. You cannot fathom the countless moments I wished to transform him into a fish and set him free in the vast ocean.”
The room filled with lighthearted laughter, the bonds of friendship and family weaving together like the strands of a well-crafted spell. For Eddie, watching them interact felt like a reminder of the strength that came from those connections—something he didn’t often realize he needed.
At that moment, the apothecary felt alive with magic—not just the kind bottled on shelves, but the kind that lingered in shared memories and warm embraces.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 6E_V3</Title>
            <Text>The streets of Aetherell Reach blurred past him, gaslamps flickering like dying stars as he pushed himself forward, lungs burning, slippers slapping against stone. The chill of the northern district clawed at his skin—through his thin t-shirt, through his worn jacket—as if the night itself wanted to slow him down.
But he didn’t stop.
His breath came in ragged bursts, each one sharp in his throat. The frost-bitten wind stung his eyes, numbed his fingers, howled past his ears like a warning—but still, he ran.
He’d outrun Will and Ashley back at the quad, their shouts falling behind him, swallowed by the dark. He didn’t look back. Couldn’t bear the thought of losing time. Every second pounded louder than his footsteps.
Please be alright.
Aetherell Reach was quieter than usual. Windows shuttered. Market stalls empty. Only the occasional flutter of paper in the gutter or the creak of a distant weathervane marked the silence.
He turned a corner too fast, nearly lost his footing on a slick patch of cobble, caught himself on a lamppost, and kept moving. His legs screamed, but his mind screamed louder.
Madeleine’s voice echoed in his memory—panicked, cut short. That sound at the end. The static. Her breath catching.
Something was wrong. Deeply wrong.
The familiar row of stone apartments came into view up ahead, their rooftops hunched against the dark. Madeleine’s place was just beyond the iron arch with the ivy-covered wall, the one she’d once pointed out to him with a quiet smile and a joke about noisy upstairs neighbors.
He passed beneath it now, breath ragged, eyes scanning every shadow, every doorway.
And then he saw it.
The phone booth.
The door hung ajar. One panel of glass shattered at the base. The receiver swayed gently on its cord like a pendulum, clinking softly against the frame.
Eddie slowed, chest heaving, heart somewhere in his throat.
“Madeleine?” he called out, voice hoarse. “Madeleine!”
No answer. Just the rustle of the ivy. The night.
A dim glow pulsed from the jade ring on his right hand. Soft green lines curled outward from the gem, forming a faint, floating transmutation circle that hovered just above his knuckles.
He inched forward.
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the windows above. Empty. Dark. Watching.
His fingers twitched at his sides. With each step, the weight in his chest grew heavier, the air colder. The transmutation circle sparked faintly as his boot brushed over broken glass.
He reached the booth.
Paused.
Looked inside.
And opened the door.
It creaked—slow, deliberate, far too loud. He winced at the sound, then froze.
Nothing.
No sign of a struggle. No blood. 
Only a single object lay on the ground.
Her wand.
Abandoned. Resting in a small patch of frost just beneath the shattered glass, its wood chipped at the grip, still faintly warm with her magic.
Eddie stared.
The chill that ran through him now had nothing to do with the wind.
He crouched slowly, picked up the wand, cradled it in both hands.
His heart hammered in his ears. His mind screamed to reject the sight.
She wouldn’t have left this behind.
One of hers.
Eddie dropped to his knees beside it, heart in freefall.
The wand trembled in his hands.
Footsteps pounded up behind him—Will and Ashley at last, their breaths ragged, eyes scanning the shadows.
Ashley skidded to a stop, staff already in her grip, the silver crystal at its tip flickering with ready light. Will pulled his wand from his guitar bag, lips parted in alarm.
“What happened?” Ashley asked, voice low and sharp, scanning the street. “Where is she?”
Will moved closer, spotting the shattered booth. “Eddie—what’s going on? What did you see?”
But Eddie couldn’t answer.
He stared down at the wand in his hands like it might vanish if he blinked. His lips parted, but no sound came out.
Ashley stepped toward him, slower now, realizing something was deeply wrong. “Eddie—”
“She’s gone,” he choked out.
They both froze.
Eddie looked up at them, and the guilt was written all over his face—etched in deep, cracked lines like faultlines across stone.
“This is my fault,” he whispered, voice fraying. “I should’ve seen it coming. I should’ve known something was wrong with Walther. I did know. I just—I thought…”
He swallowed hard, shaking his head as if trying to rewind time.
“I… I should’ve stopped her.”
His fingers clenched around the wand.
“I should’ve told her not to go. If I hadn’t gone out that night, if I hadn’t let Walther fool me, none of this would have happened.”
Will crouched down beside him, quieter now. “Mate… don’t do this.”
But Eddie didn’t seem to hear him.
“none of this would have happened… She’d still be here.” 
Ashley knelt beside him, slowly, her staff still in one hand, the other reaching out to steady his trembling shoulder. “It’s okay, Eddie. Everyhting will be alright.”
Even as she said it, the words rang hollow in her own ears.
Because deep down, she wasn’t sure they would.
She’d seen the state of the booth. The blood smeared on the glass. The cold, unnatural silence that still hung in the air. And the way Eddie held that wand—like it was all he had left.
But she said it anyway. Because Eddie needed her to.
Eddie’s breath hitched, and he gave the smallest nod—barely a twitch of muscle, but enough.
Behind them, Will stood at the edge of the pavement, silent.
He wasn’t the type to say much in moments like these.
Instead, he watched. Took in the way Ashley leaned into Eddie’s pain. The way Eddie clung to Madeleine’s wand like a lifeline. The way the wind didn’t dare blow too loud around them.
For a moment, everything felt suspended.
The streetlamp flickered. The city breathed in silence. Will didn’t move.
It was like watching a dream dissolve into a nightmare. 
Then—
A voice cut through the quiet, sharp as a snapped string.
“What’s going on here?”
Will’s head turned slightly, brow furrowed at the interruption. A silhouette stood on the pavement just beyond the booth’s shattered edge—tall, brisk, chin lifted with effortless command. Familiar in the worst way.
Will turned, half-annoyed already. The kind of voice you don’t want in a moment like this—too pointed, too knowing.
“Friend went missing,” he muttered, not really caring to explain. “That’s what’s going on.” 
The figure stepped closer. “Who?”
Will opened his mouth—but then stopped mid-breath as the figure moved into the full lamplight.
The figure was tall, poised, and unmistakably deliberate in every movement. A flannel tailored skirt hugged her frame, neat and pressed, paired with a deep navy wool blazer. Her shirt collar peeked crisp beneath it, fastened with a brooch shaped like a serpent swallowing its tail. 
Silky blonde hair fell in smooth waves past her shoulders, not a strand out of place despite the wind, as if the night itself dared not touch her. Even now, at this hour, on this street, she looked as if she’d walked straight out of a portrait hanging in the Chancellor’s Hall.
Then Will’s stomach sank.
Of course it was her.
“Aynesworth? The hell are you doing here?”
“The hell do you mean am I doing here? I live here!”
Student Council President. Prefect of North Tower. Daughter of a minor noble house. She carried her titles like swords, sharp and gleaming, and she’d nearly had them all expelled three months ago after the incident in the library archives.
“Who’s missing?” she repeated.
Will’s expression curdled. His jaw tightened.
“It’s none of your business,” he muttered coldly.
But Victoria’s eyes weren’t on him.
She stepped forward, drawn to the wand in Eddie’s hands like iron to magnet. Her expression shifted—an almost imperceptible crack in the polished veneer. Her lips parted just slightly.
“That’s her wand,” she said.
Ashley straightened. “Yes.”
Victoria’s brow furrowed. The question followed, brittle and breathless. “Madeleine’s missing?”
Will blinked, thrown. “Wait… you knew Madeleine?”
Victoria tore her eyes from the wand just long enough to shoot him a look of exhausted disbelief.
“Of course, dumbass,” she snapped. “She’s my roommate.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3</Title>
            <Text>The storefront smelled of dried herbs and bitter roots—familiar, comforting. Glass jars lined the shelves, filled with twisted bark, gnarled mushrooms, and roots that looked more like ancient talons than medicine. The air hummed with the quiet warmth of the electric kettle boiling in the back, steam curling toward the ceiling.
Eddie sat on a wooden stool, his body a patchwork of bruises. His left eye was swollen shut, purpling at the edges. His knuckles were split, his nose crusted with dried blood. His jacket hung off him, torn at the shoulder.
Lianna moved around him with practiced efficiency, her hands steady as she dabbed a cotton pad soaked in pungent herbal tincture against his split lip. Eddie winced, but didn’t pull away.
&quot;Idiot,&quot; she muttered in, her voice sharp but her touch gentle. &quot;Fighting again. Like some street thug.&quot;
Eddie stayed silent. This wasn’t the first time he’d come home like this.
When he was younger, the bruises were from accidents—falling off his bike, tripping in the schoolyard. Then, as he got older, they came from other kids—shoulder checks in the hallway, stolen lunches, the occasional shove into a locker.
And then, last year, his father—Charles—had decided enough. He’d dragged Eddie to a martial arts class, gruffly telling him, &quot;If you’re going to get hit, at least hit back.&quot;
Lianna had called them both idiots.
Now, as she pressed a cold compress to his swollen eye, she sighed. &quot;The school called. Again.&quot;
Eddie grunted.
&quot;Three boys,&quot; she continued, switching to English, her tone clipped. &quot;One with a broken nose. One with a dislocated shoulder. And Jason Hargrove—&quot;
&quot;He deserved it,&quot; Eddie muttered.
Lianna’s fingers stilled. Then, with deliberate calm, she set down the cotton pad and folded her arms. &quot;Did he?&quot;
Eddie looked away. His mother’s stare was worse than any punch.
&quot;Your father thought teaching you to fight would make you stronger,&quot; she said. &quot;But all it did was make you angrier.&quot;
&quot;They called you a Witch,&quot; Eddie shot back, his voice rough.
Lianna paused, then let out a sharp, dismissive breath. &quot;Then let them!&quot; She turned to face him fully, her dark eyes flashing. &quot;Do you think I care what some teenagers say about me?&quot;
Eddie’s fingers curled into fists on his knees. &quot;Well, I do.&quot; The words came out quieter than he meant them to. &quot;I don’t mind if they make fun of me. But if it’s you—I’m not tolerating that.&quot;
For a moment, Lianna just looked at him—really looked at him—as if seeing something in his battered face she hadn’t noticed before. Then, without another word, she turned and walked to the shelf behind the counter, reaching for fresh gauze and a small ceramic jar of ointment.
The silence that followed wasn’t heavy. It was the kind of quiet that settled between people who understood each other too well to need filling the space.
The silence that followed wasn’t heavy. It was the kind of quiet that settled between people who understood each other too well to need filling the space.
&quot;Mum...&quot; Eddie finally said, breaking the stillness. &quot;Can I ask you something slightly personal?&quot;
Lianna didn’t pause in her work, her fingers deftly wrapping gauze around his bruised knuckles. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;
&quot;You won’t get angry?&quot; Eddie teased weakly.
&quot;I’m already angry,&quot; she replied dryly, though the corner of her mouth twitched. &quot;So go ahead.&quot;
Another beat of silence.
Then—
&quot;Who... who are my real parents?&quot;
Lianna’s hands stilled. Just for a second. Then she continued bandaging, her movements slower now.
Eddie pushed forward before he could lose his nerve. &quot;Who are they? And are they well? Who’s my real family?&quot; The questions tumbled out, one after another, until he landed on the one that had been clawing at him since Jason spat it in his face: &quot;And... are they what people think they are?&quot;
The shop felt too quiet suddenly. The hum of the refrigerator, the distant drip of the tap in the back room—all of it too loud in the absence of Lianna’s answer.
Finally, she tied off the bandage and sat back, her dark eyes meeting his. There was something in her gaze Eddie couldn’t quite place—not anger, not sadness. Something heavier.
&quot;Your parents,&quot; she began carefully, &quot;were people who loved you very much.&quot;
&quot;Are they...&quot; Eddie hesitated, the question caught in his throat.
Lianna sighed, then sat on the stool beside him, the wood creaking softly under her weight. &quot;I suppose I’ve never told you the story of how we first adopted you.&quot;
Eddie’s breath hitched. &quot;No,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I don’t think you have.&quot;
For a moment, the only sound was the distant hum of the shop’s old refrigerator. Lianna folded her hands in her lap, her gaze distant, as if deciding where to begin. Then, softly:
&quot;You’re old enough now. Do you want to know?&quot;
The air between them thickened—suspense and intrigue winding tight around them. Eddie’s pulse thudded in his ears. He nodded.
Lianna took a slow breath.
&quot;It was the winter of 1995. Your father and I were in Malacca—just a stopover before we moved to the UK. Charles had just finished his paperwork for the job overseas. We were waiting for the next ship, and the docks were freezing.&quot;
Her voice softened, lost in memory. &quot;I was sitting on a bench, rubbing a warming remedy into my hands, when I noticed the woman beside me. She wore a long red coat, a black cloak draped over her shoulders, the hood pulled low. She was shivering—but not from the cold. She looked... terrified. Hollow. Like she had seen something no person should ever see.&quot;
Eddie leaned forward, his pulse quickening.
&quot;I offered her my remedy,&quot; Lianna continued. &quot;She took it, and that’s when we started talking. She called herself an Alchemist—a word I hadn’t heard since my grandfather’s old stories. She thought I was one too, but I told her I was just a medicine-maker’s daughter. No Alchemist. Just a woman who knew herbs.&quot;
A pause. The shop’s shadows seemed to deepen.
&quot;Then... she handed me a baby.&quot; Lianna’s fingers tightened around the edge of the stool. &quot;You. She said there was no safe place where she was going, that someone had to care for you until you ‘came of age.’ I argued—we were leaving the country! How could we take a child? But the way she looked at me... She had no other choice. ‘I trust no one,’ she said, ‘but I will trust a fellow Alchemist.’&quot;
“Catherine,” Lianna said. &quot;That’s when she told me her name. And yours—Edward Welton. She made me promise to write to her when you were older. Then she left. I never saw her again.&quot;
“What… What was she like?” Eddie asked
Her gaze drifted to Eddie’s face, studying his features—the same sharp green eyes, the same stubborn set of his jaw. &quot;She was tall. Fiery red hair. And her ears...&quot; Lianna traced a finger along the curve of her own ear. &quot;Long. Pointed. Hidden under that cloak, but I saw them when the wind shifted. Your father said she must have been an elf—one of the old ones from stories. He swore meeting her brought us luck. Our shop never lacked customers after that. Charles got promoted within months.&quot;
Eddie swallowed hard. &quot;So... have you written to her?&quot;
Lianna shook her head. &quot;We didn’t know what ‘come of age’ meant to her kind. But your father and I agreed—we would write to her when you finished your sixth form college.&quot; She glanced at him, her expression softening. &quot;You’re in your final year now. The time is close.&quot;
A silence settled between them, heavy with unspoken understanding. Then Lianna continued, her voice quieter, &quot;Eddie, you have a right to go to your rightful family when you’re older. We had no right to keep you as our own forever. And Catherine... she’s the only living relative we know of.&quot;
Eddie’s chest tightened. &quot;You are my family,&quot; he said fiercely.
Lianna smiled, but there was sadness in it. &quot;We will always be your family. But blood calls to blood, Eddie. yours is different.&quot;
The shop bell chimed again, sharper this time.
Eddie turned.
His father stood in the doorway, still in his dockworker’s high-vis vest, his cheeks ruddy from the cold. For a moment, his face was bright—the usual tired-but-cheerful expression he wore after a long shift. Then his eyes landed on Eddie’s bruises, the split lip, the swollen eye.
&quot;Oh goodness gracious,&quot; Charles muttered, his smile vanishing. He crossed the shop in three long strides, dropping to a crouch in front of Eddie. His calloused hands hovered, as if afraid to touch. &quot;Are you okay? What happened to you?&quot;
Eddie opened his mouth, but Lianna answered first. &quot;He got into a fight. Again.&quot;
Charles exhaled through his nose, his brow furrowing. &quot;With who?&quot;
&quot;Jason Hargrove,&quot; Eddie muttered.
Recognition flashed in Charles’s eyes, followed by something darker. &quot;That little—&quot; He cut himself off, shaking his head. &quot;Did you win?&quot;
&quot;Charles!&quot; Lianna snapped.
&quot;What? I’m just asking!&quot;
Eddie almost smiled. That was Charles—practical to a fault. No scolding, no you-should-know-better. Just did you win?
&quot;Wasn't exactly a fair fight,&quot; Eddie admitted. &quot;Five against one. But they ran off in the end, so... call it a draw.&quot;
Charles opened his mouth—probably to praise him—but Lianna's sharp glare cut him off. Instead, he cleared his throat and adopted a more fatherly tone. &quot;Look, Eddie, I get it. But you can't keep solving things with your fists. Anger management, yeah? You're smarter than this.&quot;
Lianna exhaled loudly, rubbing her temples. &quot;I give up. You two are impossible.&quot; She turned and disappeared into the back of the house, the door swinging shut behind her with a decisive click.
The shop fell silent.
Charles waited a beat, then jerked his head toward the front door. &quot;Come on. Walk with me.&quot;
Eddie knew a lecture was coming. But Charles had never been the judgmental type—just blunt, honest. So he followed.</Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 3 V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stepped off the ferry first, tossing a few coins to the ferryman before offering a hand to Torrie. As her boots hit the wooden planks, she immediately turned to take in their surroundings, but Eddie tugged his flat cap lower over his forehead, his gaze flickering warily over the busy dock.
The air here was different—crisper, drier. It lacked the thick, briny scent of Weshaven, replaced instead by the rich aromas of spice crates being unloaded, the earthy tang of dried herbs, and the occasional whiff of parchment and ink from merchants tallying their stock.
Osthaven was busier in a different way. Where Weshaven had the steady rhythm of fishermen mending nets and gutting the morning’s catch, Osthaven hummed with the brisk efficiency of trade. Dockhands hauled crates marked with foreign sigils, couriers weaved through carts, and merchants haggled over silk and spices from distant lands.
Torrie took it all in, wide-eyed. “It’s… bigger than I thought.”
Eddie forced a smirk. “Told you. Less fish guts, more commerce.”
But even as he spoke, his steps were measured, his shoulders tense beneath his coat. He pulled his flat cap down further, a quiet gesture of habit—of avoidance of the last time he’d walked these streets.
He tried not to think about it. Tried not to wonder if someone in the crowd might recognize him, might turn and whisper. It had been a year, but memories had a way of lingering.
Torrie, oblivious to his unease, strode ahead, drinking in every detail.
&quot;Look at that!&quot; she pointed excitedly to a trio of scholars in deep blue robes, their arms laden with books as they argued in hushed, hurried tones. &quot;Are they from the university?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eddie muttered. &quot;Researchers, probably. Aella’s got plenty of them.&quot;
They continued down the road, weaving through colorful stalls and past warehouse workers shouting orders.
Eddie’s gaze landed on a small stall by the corner, where the scent of roasted chestnuts drifted through the air. His fingers brushed against the strap of his bag as a familiar memory surfaced.
&quot;See that?&quot; He nudged Torrie. &quot;Markus and I used to stop there after classes. We’d split a bag of chestnuts and complain about assignments the whole way home.&quot;
Torrie wrinkled her nose. &quot;You two really bonded over complaining, huh?&quot;
Eddie smirked. &quot;It’s an art form, I tell you.&quot;
But the warmth of nostalgia faded too quickly, replaced by the weight pressing at his ribs. He shouldn’t be here. Not for long.
As they walked past a faded green awning, his steps faltered.
&quot;And that place,&quot; he pointed, voice quieter now, &quot;was where I used to get supplies for my… projects.&quot;
Torrie arched a brow. &quot;What kind of projects?&quot;
&quot;Alchemy, mostly,&quot; Eddie said, exhaling softly. &quot;The owner—grumpiest old man you'd ever meet—used to grumble about every single request I made, but he never actually turned me away.&quot;
Torrie grinned. &quot;Sounds like he liked you.&quot;
Eddie scoffed. “I think he just liked my coins.”
The humor felt thin, fleeting. His fingers curled slightly, pressing into his palms. It was strange, being back. The streets hadn’t changed, but everything felt different.
Torrie, still beaming, nudged him lightly. “You’ve been here a lot, huh?”
Eddie hesitated before nodding. “Yeah… long ago.”
“Well,” Torrie said, her voice light, “now I’m here too.”
Eddie huffed a quiet laugh, shaking his head as if to brush away the past. “Yeah. Let’s get you to Aella.”
He didn’t look back.

-o-

Eddie pedaled through the last stretch of road, the cobbled streets of Osthaven giving way to packed dirt as they left the bustle of town behind. Fields of golden hay swayed gently in the morning breeze, stretching far and wide, their soft rustling the only sound accompanying them now.
And then, past the gentle slope of the hill, Aella Academy came into view.
It stood just as Eddie remembered—tall, sturdy, with its weathered stone walls and a modest courtyard nestled at its center. It wasn’t the grandest school in Solivia, not the kind spoken of in hushed reverence like Edenfield, but around here, it was everything. A place of learning, discipline, and quiet ambition.
Eddie slowed the bike to a stop near the front gate. Torrie hopped off, adjusting her satchel, her eyes gleaming as she took in the sight before her.
“Well,” she said, turning to him, a wide grin breaking across her face, “I guess this is it.”
 “You’ll do fine, Torrie.” Eddie said, forcing a small smirk. “You better not cause too much trouble.”
She stuck her tongue out playfully before stepping forward, her pace quickening until she was practically skipping through the front gate.
Eddie lingered by the entrance, watching her go. 
He saw himself in her.
The same eagerness, the same restless energy that had carried him through these very gates years ago. He remembered what it was like, standing on the threshold of something new, looking ahead and seeing only possibility.
Now, he stood on the other side of it.
Eddie let out a quiet breath, gripping the handles a little tighter before shaking his head.
“Go get ‘em, Torrie.”
And with that, he turned the bike around and started pedaling back towards town.
He just had to get back to town, maybe find a quiet corner to sit for a while before catching the ferry home. But as he was about to mount his bike, a voice cut through the crowds of students.
“Edward!”
He flinched. His fingers tightened around the handlebars. For a second, he considered pretending he hadn’t heard. Plenty of students had the name Edward, right? It didn’t have to be him.
“Edward!… Welton!”
Eddie slowed, his stomach knotting. Slowly, hesitantly, he turned his head.
Near the front gate of Aella Academy, amidst the stream of students hurrying into the school, stood Mr. Ferie. Eddie’s old Alchemy mentor was just as he remembered—dark-skinned, balding, his round brass glasses perched on his nose, and an ever-present spark of energy in his step despite his age. The students passing by greeted him with cheerful nods and waves, a testament to how well-liked he was. And then, as he spotted Eddie, his face lit up with recognition, his hoarse but warm voice cutting through the morning air.
Mr. Ferie strode toward him, clapping a firm hand on his shoulder. “Hah! I thought that was you! It’s been years! How have you been, my boy?”
Eddie swallowed, forcing his lips into something that resembled a smile. “Uh… yeah. It’s been a while.”
Mr. Ferie beamed. “More than a while! I haven’t seen you since—” He paused, brow furrowing slightly as he searched for the last memory he had of Eddie. Then, his face brightened again. “Ah, since that competition! You had the judges hanging onto your every word—Professor Borman from Edenfield even wrote you a recommendation, didn’t he?” He chuckled, adjusting his brass-rimmed glasses. “So? Did you take the chance? Studying Alchemy at Edenfield, I hope?”
Eddie felt something sour coil in his stomach. He gripped the strap of his bag a little tighter.
“Something like that.”
Mr. Ferie chuckled. “Ah, I knew it. You always had a mind for it, Edward. All those competitions—still remember the time you turned an iron ingot into living vinework? That was a masterpiece! One of the finest young alchemists I ever had the pleasure of mentoring.”
Eddie stiffened. He could feel the expectation in Mr. Ferie’s voice, the unshaken belief in who he used to be.
His hands felt clammy. The last thing he wanted was to stand here, listening to praise that didn’t belong to him anymore.
Mr. Ferie, oblivious to his unease, clapped his hands together. “So! What brings you back to Osthaven? Surely not just a visit?”
Eddie shifted his weight. “Just dropping someone off.”
“Oh? A friend?”
“My… sister.”
Mr. Ferie’s brows lifted. “Torrie, was it? Following in your footsteps, then! That’s wonderful.”
Eddie forced a chuckle, but it barely held.
Mr. Ferie sighed wistfully. “Ah, you know, I always hoped I’d see you again, Edward. You had such promise. I can only imagine the things you’ve accomplished since Edenfield.”
Eddie’s throat tightened. He glanced away, fingers gripping the strap of his bag as if it could anchor him. His mind scrambled for an exit.
Lie. Tell him you’re doing fine. That you’re excelling. That you’re still the student he remembers.
But the words wouldn’t come.
“I—uh, I should get going,” Eddie blurted. “Mum’s expecting me.”
Mr. Ferie blinked, surprise flickering across his face. “Oh? Well, I suppose we’ll catch up properly another time—”
But Eddie was already moving, swinging himself onto his bike. “Yeah—yeah, of course,” he called over his shoulder, forcing a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
And then he was pedaling away, fast enough that the cobbled road rattled beneath his tires. Fast enough that Mr. Ferie’s voice faded into the morning hum of Aella Academy. Fast enough that he didn’t have to see the warmth in his mentor’s eyes turn into something else—realization, maybe, or disappointment.
He didn’t look back.


-o-

Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the hum of the town buzzing around him. The salty breeze had thinned, replaced by the scent of fresh bread, spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach reminded him, with a low grumble, that breakfast had been hurried.
He slowed to a stop near a familiar stall, the one that sold honeyed almonds and sesame biscuits. The sight alone pulled him back to old routines—grabbing a bag for himself, an extra for Markus. It had been a while, but some habits never quite faded.
After paying the vendor, he stepped back toward his bicycle, ready to sling the bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
A building stood across the street, its architecture different from the others around it. Age clung to its stone walls, yet the towering columns bore intricate carvings, their shapes unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, but their elegance remained, a relic of a bygone era.
Above the heavy wooden doors, an emblem was set in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into the worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, something stirring in his chest. He hadn’t noticed it before—maybe he had never cared to look. But now, standing there, it felt like the building was watching him back.
Eyes tracing the contours of the emblem, Eddie lingered a moment longer, the owl’s unblinking gaze seeming almost knowing. The Sage Institute. He knew nothing about it—had never needed to—but something about it gnawed at the edges of his mind. A curiosity, fleeting yet persistent.
With a breath, he shook it off, tucking the bag of snacks securely inside his satchel before turning back to his bicycle. The world outside his thoughts rushed back in—the chatter of merchants, the rhythmic clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the occasional call of dockworkers hauling cargo.
He swung a leg over the bike and pushed off, weaving through the streets of Osthaven with practiced ease. The town passed him by in a blur of nostalgia and familiarity, but his mind remained half elsewhere, lingering on the building, on the emblem, on the feeling.
The distant chime of a bell tower reminded him of the time. He wasn’t in a hurry, but he didn’t want to miss the next ferry back to Weshaven either.
By the time he reached the harbor, the ferry was already boarding. He rolled his bicycle up the gangway, found a quiet spot near the railing, and exhaled, letting the sea breeze wash over him.
Back to Weshaven. Back to his routines.

-o-

Eddie stepped off the ferry, the lingering scent of salt and fish clinging to his coat as he pedaled back through the familiar streets of Weshaven. The town moved at its usual pace—fishermen hauling in their morning catches, merchants calling out their wares, the rhythmic hammering of shipwrights at work. It felt routine, but his thoughts still lingered on Osthaven, on Aella, on the emblem of the owl perched on a scroll.
By the time he reached the apothecary, the comforting scent of herbs and simmering potions greeted him like an old friend. He pushed open the wooden door and stepped into the brewing room, where golden light streamed through the lofty windows, casting long, shifting shadows.
A deep but gentle voice called out from the far end of the room, its warmth filling the space like the heat of a hearth.
&quot;Morning, Edward!&quot;
Markus stood hunched over his workstation, his broad frame making the desk seem almost too small for him. His wild curls peeked out from under his cap, and a faint flush colored his round cheeks—likely from standing over boiling cauldrons all morning. 
He was a large presence in every sense, but his movements were measured, careful, and full of practiced ease as he stirred a simmering mixture, his huge hands treating delicate ingredients with surprising gentleness.
Eddie smirked and reached into his satchel. &quot;Got you something.&quot;
Markus glanced up, his dark eyes curious as Eddie handed over a small paper bag. A familiar scent wafted from within.
&quot;You didn’t,&quot; Markus breathed, opening the bag to reveal golden-brown roasted chestnuts. His expression flickered between delight and nostalgia.
&quot;Stopped by the old stall,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Figured you’d appreciate it.&quot;
&quot;You really do know how to make a guy’s morning.&quot; Markus chuckled, popping one into his mouth and sighing contentedly. &quot;So, how’d it go? With Torrie, I mean.&quot;
&quot;Good. Aella still looks like Aella.&quot; Eddie exhaled, glancing past Markus as if he could still see the academy in the distance. &quot;Nothing much has changed since we were there.&quot;
Markus hummed, a small smile tugging at his lips. &quot;I bet she was buzzing with excitement.&quot;
&quot;Practically skipping through the gates,&quot; Eddie admitted with a chuckle.
Markus laughed, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, that sounds about right.&quot; He rolled up his sleeves, returning his focus to the potion before him. &quot;She’s gonna do great there, you know. Always knew she had it in her.&quot;
Eddie didn’t respond immediately, just nodded, watching the steam rise from Markus’s cauldron.
For a moment, it was like old times.
Eddie had just popped a chestnut into his mouth when Markus spoke, his voice casual but laced with meaning.
“Oh, by the way—Mr. Welton wants to see you earlier.”
Eddie froze mid-chew. A slow, creeping realization dawned on him.
He was supposed to hand over the formula today.
“Damn it—I forgot!” He shot upright,  swallowed hard, nearly choking. nearly knocking over a stack of parchment on the counter.
“Yeah, figured.” Markus raised an amused brow, still munching on his snack. “He’s already up at the tower.”
Cursing under his breath, Eddie spun on his heel and bolted toward the stairs. His boots thudded against the wooden steps as he rushed to his desk, rummaging through scattered notes, ink-stained pages, and unfinished drafts. Where the hell was it?
He shoved aside a worn-out alchemy textbook, and there it was—the carefully scribed formula, buried beneath a pile of old scribbles.
Snatching it up, he didn’t waste another second. He turned on his heel and sprinted towards the tower, heart pounding.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font of
their house. This PDF file was generated via Scrivener's compile
feature and was created from the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all
caps about halfway down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word
from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).

         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                 Chapter Two

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert
&gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the
word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit
&gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100--this
feature is used on the title page of this manuscript, in fact).

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In

reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Text>Eddie stepped through the gate, and the moment his foot crossed the threshold, the air changed. It was warmer here, lighter. He could hear the rustle of grass underfoot, the creaking of wood in the distance, and the soft grunts and murmurs of things—living things—all around him.
He followed close behind Madeleine, taking in the view.
The sheer scale of the place stopped him in his tracks.
Compared to the Book Pirates' so-called “headquarters”—a musty, booze-stained basement barely large enough for a table and mismatched chairs—this was… acres. Fences crisscrossed the landscape, separating fields and paddocks, with stone paths winding between tall grass and wildflowers. Some cabins stood off to the side, their moss-covered roofs blending with the landscape, while distant sheds and enclosures dotted the horizon like watchful outposts.
And the creatures.
There were creatures everywhere.
A herd of something deer-like but scaled grazed lazily near the fence. Bright-feathered bird-beasts perched on low posts, ruffling their wings with annoyed chirps. A furry, long-legged animal with too many eyes blinked up at Eddie from behind a fence and then went back to chewing on a branch.
“This is the front range,” Madeleine said, her tone casual but proud. “We keep the gentler ones closer to the gate. Rescue gryphlings, retired hippogriffs, a few centaur folk who don’t mind being neighbors.”
Eddie’s eyes wandered further out, where the landscape dipped into shadowy groves and distant enclosures. “And the dragons?”
“Back there,” she said, nodding toward the tree line in the far distance. “We keep the more aggressive or high-risk creatures farther out—dragons, manticores, anything that breathes fire or bites through steel.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “And that’s where you want to take me?”
She nodded. “Eventually, yes.”
Eddie gave a skeptical chuckle, leaning slightly on his crutch. “Because nothing says recovery like a stroll through the fire-breathing death animals.”
Madeleine laughed. “You haven’t even met one of the cute fire-breathing animals yet.”
Eddie blinked. “I’m sorry, did you just put ‘cute’ and ‘fire-breathing’ in the same sentence?”
She grinned. “You’ll see.”
Eddie looked out over the Sanctuary again. Even from here, he could see the faint shimmer of heat waves rising from the far end, where the tree line thickened and the fences became taller, reinforced with wards and polished iron. Something inside him stirred—a mix of nerves, curiosity, and that same stubborn instinct that had made him board the bus in the first place.
Madeleine rolled her eyes fondly. “Before that, I need to speak to someone,” 
She led the way toward a modest stone building tucked under a slope, ivy creeping along its walls and a slanted roof sagging just slightly at the edges. A hand-painted sign above the door read: Caretaker’s Office. Eddie followed her in, the faint scent of parchment and pine oils wafting from within.
At the reception desk, a student leaned back in a worn leather chair, flipping through a thick ledger with one hand and munching on something out of a paper bag with the other. He looked up as they entered.
“Hey Hughes,” Madeleine greeted, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Who was in charge of the gates today?”
Hughes—tall, freckled, popped the rest of his snack into his mouth and replied around a chew. “Victor. Why?”
Madeleine’s brows furrowed. “Then why were the gates closed? It’s not past hours yet.”
Hughes shrugged, turning the ledger around lazily. “Security reasons.”
Madeleine blinked, clearly offended. “What security? We already have three layers. There’s the perimeter fences, the Illusory Gate, and the fact that the entire Sanctuary is surrounded by a cloaked forest. Nothing gets in or out without going through the gate. You know that.”
Hughes sighed like he’d been waiting for this part. “Look, I just follow the memo, alright. Got word from the Student Council—said we needed to re-evaluate the Sanctuary’s security measures. Something about recent creature attacks near campus.” He held up a crumpled newspaper. “They’re calling it a warning. If we don’t comply, they’ll start pulling campus support.”
“That’s ridiculous,” Madeleine snapped, eyes narrowing. “We’ve done a full count. There’s nothing missing, nothing added. Every species is accounted for.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Hughes said, shrugging again. “If the Student Council says jump, I ask how high. I don’t make the rules, Madeleine.”
Madeleine, more composed now, held out her hand. “Fine. Just give me the key to the Back Range. I’m giving my friend a tour.”
Hughes hesitated a beat, then opened a drawer and slid out a slender iron key. “Here,” he said, but gave Eddie a pointed look. “Just… be careful, alright? Last thing I need is a second ‘incident report’ because someone wandered into a wyvern nest with a limp.”
Eddie raised a brow. “Oi, you guys talking about me?” he said, in mock offense. “Because I thrive in wyvern-infested terrain, thank you very much.”
Madeleine smirked but didn’t linger. “Thanks, Hughes,” she said, snatching the key before turning on her heel. “Come on.”
Eddie followed her out, crutch thudding softly against the wooden floor as the door creaked shut behind them. Sunlight filtered through the trees again as they stepped onto the winding dirt path toward the Back Range, the air cooler, quieter, and oddly charged—like something was waiting just ahead.

-o-

As Eddie and Madeleine walked deeper into the Sanctuary, the mood began to shift. Near the front, sunlight still touched the fences and grassy paths, where Sanctuary members were leading tours for wide-eyed elementary-aged students in matching cloaks. A small group clustered near a gentle, antlered beast with scales like polished stone, giggling as it bowed to let them pet its snout.
Farther along, two caretakers were gently helping an older couple onto the back of a large, feathery creature. It had the wide, watchful eyes of an owl, a powerful bear-like body covered in dappled down, and tucked at its sides—massive, elegant wings folded like cloaks. The creature gave a low, soothing hoot as it crouched to let the riders on, its claws curling into the grass with surprising care.
It moved with the softness of snowfall, each step deliberate, like it was trying not to startle the breeze.
Eddie blinked. “That is either the world’s weirdest therapy bird, or a very fluffy nightmare.”
Madeleine smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling. “That’s Bramble. He’s a winged owl-bear griffin. Great with nervous riders.”
As they walked deeper into the sanctuary, the cheerful sounds began to fade, replaced by the hush of thickening woods. The trees here grew denser, the canopy forming a living roof that swallowed the sun. The air turned cooler, stiller, and more humid. Eddie noticed the path narrowing as vines and moss crept along the edges, and the sound of their footfalls became muffled on the leafy ground.
Madeleine glanced back at him. “This is part of the containment,” she said. “The trees are grown close on purpose—enchanted and cultivated this way. Nothing with wings can take off easily in here.”
Eddie blinked. “A forest as a cage.”
“A forest as a net,” Madeleine corrected gently. “A soft one. The creatures don’t feel trapped, but it keeps everyone safe.”
They finally stepped into the Back Range, marked by a simple wooden arch wrapped in glowing vines. The shadows here were thick, and the only light came from hanging lanterns and fruits that glowed softly like moonlight—violet, blue, and faintly golden.
Many of the enclosures were hidden by dark fabrics or veils of moss. Muffled growls and low, thudding breaths rumbled from behind them, unseen but deeply felt. One enclosure bore claw marks on the bark of the trees surrounding it, but no sign of the creature inside.
Madeleine’s expression grew somber. “These ones are all recovering,” she said softly. “Most of them were pulled from military use. Trained, abused, pushed past their limits. They weren’t made for war—but they were used like weapons.”
Eddie looked around, his gaze flicking from veil to lantern to the faint glow of eyes peering through a curtain of vines. “So they’re injured?”
“Body and spirit,” she said. “Some are still too aggressive to be handled. Others…” She paused. “Others just need someone to sit near them and remind them they’re not tools.”
The silence that followed was heavier than before. Around them, the woods seemed to watch.
And as they moved forward, Eddie began to see more of the creatures—strange, otherworldly, and awe-inspiring. A towering quadruped with armor-like plates over its shoulders huffed in its sleep. A translucent, almost ghostly winged cat with double pupils crept along the high branches. A half-curled serpent with burning red eyes followed them with its gaze from behind a thick enchanted net.
Eddie gripped his crutch tighter. “Remind me again why we’re walking towards the terrifying creatures?”
Madeleine smirked. “Because you need to see one of them.”
She led Eddie off the path, up a wooden ramp that creaked under their feet, toward one of the enclosed indoor glass sanctuaries tucked between the thick roots of the forest. The structure was built into the trees, its windows fogged and dark, blending into the woodland like a secret hidden in plain sight.
Inside, the light dimmed. The sanctuary enclosure was cloaked in heavy shadow, its interior a terrain of sand, rock, and thick branches stacked like ribs. The plaque on the glass read in precise lettering:
South Alamirian Tiger – Panthera Alamaris
Female. Estimated Age: 7. Confiscated from illegal exotic circus. High reactivity. Do not tap on enclosure.
Eddie shifted his weight onto his crutch and looked around. “Right. So… what exactly am I supposed to see?”
“Keep your voice down,” Madeleine murmured, already crouching near a sack on the side. She reached inside and pulled out a thick slab of meat wrapped in brown cloth. With practiced hands, she unraveled it and picked up a feeding stick—a long rod with a clamp at the end—and gently stabbed the meat.
Eddie was about to ask another question when he heard it.
A low, reverberating growl rolled through the enclosure like a slow thunder. He stiffened.
Madeleine didn’t flinch. She simply walked forward and held the rod out, her voice suddenly soft and coaxing. “Here, girl,” she said, like she was trying to tempt a housecat out from under a couch.
A blur of motion. Something large and lean lunged from the shadows—and in a blink, the meat was gone. Snatched mid-air with a sickening crunch. The rod quivered slightly in Madeleine’s hand.
Then it stepped into view.
Eddie’s breath caught in his throat.
The creature was tall—taller than any normal big cat he’d ever seen. Its body was thin, almost gaunt, but taut with power. A desert-colored coat stretched over sharp muscles, broken only by black stripes like brushstrokes. Its eyes glowed amber in the gloom, wild and intelligent. It prowled low, its massive paws silent against the rock, its tail twitching.
But it wasn’t the size that struck Eddie dumb.
It was the familiarity.
He knew this shape. The lean torso. The long arms. The face—feral but almost knowing.
This was it.
It was the same silhouette that had lunged at him through the firelight back on campus. Except… not quite. This one was unmistakably an animal. Its movements were feline, graceful, natural. Not like the twisted, upright thing that had ambushed him.
Madeleine, still holding the rod, glanced at Eddie and smiled gently. “She’s a South Alamirian Tiger,” she said, her voice tinged with affection. “Hails from the furthest end of the Alamirian Dunes. Not many left in the wild. This one was taken from a traveling circus in the Northern Markets. Starved, overworked, shackled since she was a cub. She barely knew how to use her claws when they brought her in.”
Her eyes sparkled now—pride, defiance, maybe even joy—as she spoke. “She’s the only one we have in the Sanctuary. Took months before she would even let us stand this close. Now she eats from the stick. One day I’m hoping she’ll come right to my hand.”
Eddie didn’t answer right away. He was still watching the tiger, who now licked the blood off her paw with slow, deliberate motions.
Madeleine turned to him, her tone more serious. “Is this what attacked you?”
Eddie shook his head slowly. “No. Not exactly.”
She frowned. “But it looks the same?”
“Very close,” he said. “Same kind of movement. Same claws. Same… eyes, even.” He paused, searching for the right words. “But that one was… it stood upright. Two legs. Not like a person pretending to be an animal. It was like an animal pretending to be a person. Walked like one. Moved like one.”
Madeleine’s expression darkened. Her shoulders stiffened as she slowly lowered the feeding rod, now empty. She wasn’t looking at the tiger anymore—her gaze had drifted somewhere distant, unfocused. A thought had struck her. A terrible one.
She looked… disturbed. As if her mind had gone somewhere she didn’t want to follow.
“That’s…” she started, then stopped, her jaw clenched. “That’s terrifying.”
Eddie stayed quiet.
“I know.”
“It’s not just that one of them were loose in Edenfield,” she went on, voice low, nearly a whisper. “It’s that I don’t want to imagine what they stitched together to make something like that.”
Eddie swallowed. The silence stretched. Only the soft, wet sound of the tiger chewing filled the air, methodical and primal.
Madeleine finally looked back at him, eyes more focused now. “We need to do something about this.”
Eddie nodded. “We should meet up with the others. At the Library. Midnight as usual.”
Madeleine blinked. Then, slowly, a small smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. She stepped forward and tapped him gently on the arm. “Next week,” she said softly. “You need to rest first.”
Eddie exhaled. He hadn't realized how tightly he’d been gripping his crutch. “Yeah… okay. Next week.”
Madeleine nodded, her expression softening. “I know someone who might be able to help,” she said quietly. “They’ve got connections with the district government—real ones, not just student council nonsense. I can let them know about our next meeting.”
Eddie looked up at her, curious. “You trust them?”
“I do,” she said, firm but calm. “They’ll be glad to help. Especially if something this dangerous is walking around Edenfield.”
Eddie nodded slowly. The silence returned, filled only by the soft crunching of the tiger eating its meal behind the glass. The weight of what they’d just discussed still lingered, but something in Madeleine’s certainty settled him a little.
Outside, the leaves rustled in the thick trees above. The tiger, finished with her meal, settled back into the shadows, vanishing like a ghost into the enclosure’s far corner.</Text>

            <Text>Catherine and Markus ventured further, guided by the lights of Catherine’s staff. The dense forest gradually thinned, revealing scattered fragments of stone.
At first, just a few half-buried columns, their faded white surfaces cracked and leaning, worn down by time. The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp earth.
As they ventured deeper, the ruins around them became more distinct. More columns lay toppled, some broken in half, others standing in defiance of centuries past. Then, beyond a ridge, the remnants of a vast structure emerged—a ruin far greater than the scattered fragments before. 
Its once mighty walls stood in defiance, their surfaces adorned with creeping vines and twisted roots. Whatever this place had been, nature had not only reclaimed it—it had consumed it, growing through the stone like a slow and patient conqueror.
Markus abruptly stopped, his grip tightening on the flintlock rifle. His gaze landed on a stone sign, half-buried in the dirt. The faint, scorched lettering was written in an unfamiliar, elegant script.
Catherine stepped closer, brushing some of the dirt away with her gloved hand. Her eyes traced the symbols carefully. “It’s Elvish,” she murmured. “‘Welcome to Craemonia.’”
Markus let out a slow breath. “Welcome, huh?” His voice was dry, uneasy. “Doesn’t feel very welcoming to me.” He swept his gaze over the ruins, rifle raised slightly, as if the shadows themselves might lunge at them.
“What is this place, anyway?” Markus continued.
“Just like the sign said, It’s Craemonia…”Catherine answered, “The Bastion of Craemonia. This was an elven stronghold, built under the reign of Emperor Nocturnilus the Conqueror.”
“Nocturnilus the Conqueror?” Markus glanced at her. “Never would’ve thought his reign would reach even to Weshaven.”
“His empire reaches far at the time, Weshaven might be a small island, but he probably had found some use for it.” Catherine stepped forward, her staff tapping against the stones as she walked. “And he used this bastion as a research outpost… for Alchemy.”
Markus raised an eyebrow. “Alchemy? But I thought Elves had already known Alchemy?”
“We didn’t have it back then,” Catherine confirmed. “Alchemy came from the nomadic tribes of the eastern dunes. At the time, the Elves hadn’t discovered it yet. Emperor Nocturnilus was determined to unlock its secrets before the mortals and the dwarves.”
 “So…” Markus frowned. “What happened?”
“As you know, Nocturnilus’s reign collapsed, the once solitary Elven community integrated with the mortals, they had forgotten their Emperor.” Catherine’s steps slowed. She looked up at the ruined bastion. “But the remnant of his conquest lay littered across the continents, like this one here. And whatever he discovered… it wasn’t Alchemy.”
A breeze stirred the overgrown foliage, whispering through the ruins like a voice lost in time. Markus exhaled sharply. “That’s not ominous at all.”
The road ahead narrowed as they reached the outer walls—vast, towering things that still bore the remnants of intricate carvings. Beyond them, deeper in the ruins, loomed what remained of the Bastion’s inner sanctum.
“Yeah… I really don’t like this place, Miss Catherine.” Markus adjusted his rifle uneasily. “You’re sure this is where we need to be?”
 “This is the place.” Catherine nodded, her eyes fixed on the ruin. “The Codex may be still inside.” She paused, then added, “If it’s still here.” 
Markus groaned, lowering the rifle enough to look at her. “If it’s still here? Great. We came all this way for a maybe.” 

“Not just a maybe.” Catherine smirked faintly. “A once-in-a-lifetime, maybe. There’s a difference.”  

Markus shook his head, muttering under his breath as he adjusted his grip on the rifle. “Now I get it why Eddie don’t want to go.” 

-o-

The mossy pavement wound between crumbling archways and open courtyards, as Catherine and Markus made their way. 
Step by step, the ruins revealed themselves. Beyond the fallen columns and collapsed archways, a massive structure came into view. The grand edifice stood partially intact, its vast stone walls weathered but unyielding. To the right, another building loomed, connected by a ruined hallway. The skeletal remains of a shattered dome crowned the secondary structure, and within its collapsed roof, an enormous telescope lay broken and rusting, its once-polished frame now dulled by time.
Markus let out a low whistle. “That’s… not what I expected.”
Catherine stopped beside him, her gaze sweeping over the structures. “This is the Aeron Laboratory.” Her voice carried a quiet awe. “Named after Aeron, one of the Nine Sages of Enlightenment. But before he became a Sage, this was his laboratory.”
Markus eyed the ruins warily. “And what exactly was he researching?”
Catherine exhaled slowly. “Alchemy. Or at least… that was the intention.”
They crossed the threshold into the ruined laboratory. The temperature seemed to drop as they stepped inside. The roof had caved in long ago, and moonlight streamed through the gaps, illuminating rows of tarnished silver equipment. Alembics, retorts, and distillation coils still lined the cracked stone tables, their glass components shattered into jagged remnants on the floor. A thick layer of dust coated everything, disturbed only by the occasional shift of wind.
“This was a laboratory?” Markus muttered. “Doesn’t look like much now.”
Catherine stepped forward, brushing dust off a silver alembic, its once-polished surface dulled with age. “It was more than that,” she said. “Aeron was one of Nocturnilus’s chief researcher. This was his work.”
Markus shot her a look. “Nocturnilus’s? You mean the same Nocturnilus who tried to conquer half the world? I didn’t expect they had worked together.”
Catherine nodded. “Before he saw the truth of what he was serving.” She ran a hand over a series of faded engravings on the wall. “Aeron was a scholar, fascinated with the nature of Alchemy—back when the Elves knew nothing about it. Nocturnilus wanted him to uncover its secrets, to wield it as a tool of power. But… something changed.”
Markus frowned. “What do you mean, ‘changed’?”
“He left,” she said quietly. “Abandoned his work. Abandoned this place. He never spoke of what he found here.”
Markus exhaled, scanning the ruined lab once more. The broken equipment, the fractured ceiling, the eerie quiet. “So whatever he discovered…” He gestured around them. “It wasn’t Alchemy.”
Catherine didn’t answer.
The wind stirred through the open roof, rustling the overgrown foliage. Somewhere in the ruins, something shifted—stone settling, or perhaps something else.
Catherine tore her gaze away from the wall, stepping back from the runes. “Let’s find what we came for.”
The arching corridor led them forward, deeper into the ruined bastion. The white stone walls narrowed, then expanded into a vast, open chamber. As Catherine and Markus stepped through the threshold, their breath caught at the sight before them.
The Grand Hall of the Observatory stretched wide, its ceiling once a magnificent dome, now fractured and open to the night sky. Jagged remnants of the collapsed telescope loomed above, its broken frame catching the silver light of the moon. The glow filtered through the shattered structure, casting long, spectral beams onto the marble floor. Dust swirled in the air, dancing in the pale luminescence.
At the center of the hall, standing alone beneath the celestial glow, was the lectern.
It was ancient, carved from the same pale stone as the bastion itself. Intricate elven engravings ran along its sides, whispering of knowledge long forgotten. And resting atop it, bathed in the moon’s embrace, was a book—its leather cover faded, its gilded edges worn with time.
Catherine’s steps were slow, deliberate. Her fingers hovered over the tome before she lifted it with a reverence reserved for something sacred. The weight of history pressed against her palms.
She turned the first page, then another, eyes sweeping over the delicate, curling script within. The scent of aged parchment filled the air as she flipped through its contents, scanning, absorbing.
Then, at last, she stilled. A slow, satisfied exhale escaped her lips.
Catherine turned to Markus, her eyes gleaming with something between triumph and awe.
“This is it,” she whispered, her voice carrying through the grand hall like a proclamation. Her fingers traced the worn title inscribed within.
“Codex Chilandar.”
Catherine stood still, her fingers lingering on the worn pages of the Codex, her heart still steady from the thrill of discovery.
Then—something shifted.
A flicker. A whisper of movement.
The moonlight, so pristine only moments before, dimmed—just for an instant. As if something vast and unseen had passed before it.
Catherine’s breath caught. She turned sharply, eyes scanning the ruined chamber.
“What was that?” Markus whispered. His grip tightened around the flintlock rifle as his instincts flared. He raised the barrel, eyes darting to the shadows. Nothing moved. Nothing stirred. And yet—
A distant creak. A soft, falling pebble.
Then—
With a deafening roar, the ceiling above them shattered.
White stone and rusted metal rained down as the remnants of the collapsed dome gave way. A monstrous form plunged through the fractured sky, wings of shadow unfurling with a terrible force. Dust and debris surged outward in a choking storm.
Catherine staggered back, the impact tearing her from her thoughts. Her hands slipped—the Codex tumbled from her grasp, landing with a hollow thud before the lectern.
Markus fired. The shot rang out, the flash of gunpowder illuminating the chaos for an instant—then fading uselessly against the dark, scaled hide of the beast.
The creature stood before them now, massive and inescapable. Dark wings unfurled, their jagged edges slicing through the settling dust. A maw lined with glistening fangs parted, exhaling a deep, shuddering breath that smelled of ash and decay.
And between its taloned feet, the Codex lay, untouched.
“Markus, go.” Her voice was firm, urgent.
He didn’t lower the rifle. “I’m not leaving you.”
Catherine’s eyes flicked between him and the dragon.
“Markus,” she snapped. “I can handle this. But not with you in the way.”
He clenched his jaw. “I can help—”
“You’ll die!”
The words cut through the air sharper than any blade.
Markus stiffened.
Catherine’s expression softened, just slightly. “Go back to the Traveller’s Path, get to Eddie and Torrie.” Her voice lowered, urgent but not unkind. “I need you out of here. Now.”
Markus hesitated. “Catherine—”
“I have lived longer than you and your entire lineage combined.” She took a step forward, her staff firm in her grip. “I know what I’m doing.”
The dragon inhaled sharply.
Markus cursed under his breath. His fingers twitched against the rifle. He stole one last glance at her. Then—
He turned and ran.
The Grand Hall trembled behind him as the beast let out a bone-rattling snarl. The last thing he saw before vanishing through the broken archway was Catherine, standing firm, facing the creature alone.

            <Title>Chapter 15 old</Title>
            <Text>The party had made significant progress along the Traveller’s Path. Markus had filled his and Eddie’s bags with various alchemical ingredients. Dried herbs, rare roots, and shimmering mushrooms would fetch a high price in the market. Torrie, her eyes shining with triumph. Had found a jar filled with delicate pixies flitting about in a small, iridescent cloud. The tiny creatures looked at their captors, their faint light casting whimsical patterns on the jar’s glass.
They had reached a clearing amidst the path, a small open area where the forest seemed to hold its breath. Catherine stood at the edge of the clearing, her eyes scanning the dense foliage beyond the path. She looked determined, her staff held in one hand, its crystal glinting in the low light.
“Well, I’ve found what I needed for now,” Catherine said. Her voice carries a blend of satisfaction and intrigue. Her eyes sparkled as she glanced toward the winding path ahead. “But there’s something else—a piece of history I must retrieve. If I’m reading the map correctly, the ArtefactArtefact should be just beyond that ridge.” She paused, a flicker of excitement crossing her face. “It’s not every day you get to trace the footsteps of the Nine Sages themselves. This could be... monumental.”
Markus glanced nervously at the dark expanse beyond the glowing flowers of the Traveller’s Path. “Catherine, I don’t think going outside the path’s a good idea. I’ve heard the forest can be dangerous and risky even for well-prepared people.”
Torrie nodded, her face reflecting concern. “Yeah, Catherine, it’s not worth the risk. We’ve already gathered so much here. Maybe we should just head back.”
Catherine shook her head, her expression firm. “I understand your concerns, but this ArtefactArtefact isn’t just another trinket for my collection. It’s the cornerstone of my research, and with the deal I’ve struck, walking away now isn’t an option. Opportunities like this don’t come twice. I can’t let it slip through my fingers.”
Eddie, who had been silently observing the exchange, spoke up. “Markus, you’re the only one here who can help Catherine if something goes wrong. You’re magically gifted; you can protect yourselves better than the rest of us.”
Markus hesitated. Glancing from Eddie to Catherine, then back to the darkness beyond the path. “But it’s dangerous out there. I... I’m not sure I’m ready for this.”
Eddie sighed, gripping the flintlock rifle slung over his shoulder before unslinging it. “Look, I get it. None of us want to do this, but if anyone can handle it, it’s you. You’ve got the talent, and Catherine needs this artefact. It’s worth the risk.”
He held the rifle to Markus, the polished wood glinting faintly in the dim light. “Take this. You might need it more than I will.”
Markus blinked in surprise, glancing at the rifle and then back at Eddie. “Are you serious?”
Eddie nodded, his expression uncharacteristically grim. “It’s not just for show. Do you know how to use it? Do you remember the times we practised with Alfred? You’ll be glad you have it if anything happens out there.”
Catherine’s eyes narrowed slightly as she studied Eddie. “You’re not coming?” she asked, curious in her voice.
Eddie looked away, scratching the back of his neck. “I’d just slow you down,” he said quickly, avoiding her gaze. “Besides, Markus is better equipped for this sort of thing. I’ll stay here with Torrie.”
Markus sighed, clearly torn. He glanced at Catherine, who looked at him with a mixture of hope and anxiety. Finally, he nodded, though his reluctance was evident. “Alright, I’ll go with you. But only because it seems important.”
Catherine’s face brightened with relief. “Thank you, Markus. I promise we’ll be cautious.”
Eddie watched as Catherine and Markus prepared to leave. Catherine adjusting her staff. The tension in the air was palpable, and Eddie couldn’t help but feel a pang of concern. He knew the risks involved and hoped their decision to split up wouldn’t lead to unforeseen trouble.
“Be careful out there, yeah, Markus?” Eddie said, his voice carrying a hint of unspoken worry.
“We will,” Catherine assured him, giving him a warm, albeit slightly strained, smile. “And we’ll be back as soon as we can.”
Catherine and Markus stepped beyond the glowing barrier of Illuminas. The contrast between the safety of the Traveler’s Path and the dark forest beyond became palpable. The air seemed to grow colder, and the soft glow of the flowers behind them grew dimmer as they moved further into the unknown.
Eddie turned to Torrie, who was still holding her jar of pixies. Her excitement was dimmed by her aunt's worry. “Let’s stay put for now. We’ll give them some time and make sure everything’s alright.”
Torrie nodded, though her eyes flicked toward the darkened edge of the forest. “I just hope they come back soon. The forest... it feels different now.”
Eddie glanced back toward the path. His own feelings are a mix of apprehension and resignation. He had promised himself not to use magic. But as he watched Catherine and Markus disappear into the darkness. He couldn’t help but wonder if things might have been different if he had chosen another path.
All he could do now was wait and hope for their safe return. </Text>

            <Text>The forest felt different now—hostile and foreboding. The air grew colder, and a sense of dread seeped into Eddie's bones. He held his rifle tightly, his senses alert for any sign of danger. Every crack of a branch or rustle of leaves seemed amplified in the oppressive silence.
Eddie's heart pounded as he plunged into the darkness beyond the Traveller's Path. The surrounding forest was dense and oppressive, its shadows closing in like a suffocating shroud. The warm glow of the Lumina flowers faded behind him, leaving only the cold, eerie light of the moon to guide his way.
His rifle rested on his shoulder, but the weapon felt heavy and awkward in his hands. Every snap of a twig or rustle of leaves heightened Eddie's senses, setting his nerves on edge. The forest was alive with whispers and shuffles, and the undergrowth cracked with unseen creatures. Eddie moved through the dense foliage. He noticed eyes watching him from the dark. They glowed with an unsettling array of colours—fiery reds, cool blues, and ghostly greens. Creatures of all shapes and sizes peered out from behind trees and rocks. Their eyes tracked his every movement. Some were curious, their heads tilted as they observed him with interest. Others were more wary, their gazes sharp and assessing. The forest was like a living entity, a myriad of eyes in the dark scrutinising the intruder.
Eddie's breath came in shallow, controlled bursts. He could feel the weight of the forest's gaze upon him. The very trees and creatures were trying to decipher his purpose. Was he a hunter? A threat? The forest seemed to sense the intent behind his presence, but Eddie's focus was not on aggression. His posture, though tense, did not convey a desire to harm but a determination to protect.
He had always read about the Deep Glaive's unpredictability, but experiencing it firsthand was an entirely different challenge. The silence between the rustling leaves and occasional growls was deafening, broken only by the distant roar of the Nightingale Fox, which drove Eddie forward.
The forest itself felt alive, its magic palpable in the air. The shadows appeared to writhe and shift. Trees seemed as if they were watching him, their ancient limbs stretching out to obscure his path. The atmosphere grew colder, and a shiver ran down Eddie's spine. Every step he took was carefully measured, his rifle held ready but lowered—he had no desire to provoke, only to find and rescue Catherine. He navigated through the underbrush. Eddie's sharp eyes caught glimpses of strange flora and fauna. Vividly coloured mushrooms glowed faintly in the dark, and vines pulsed with a bioluminescent rhythm. The creatures that stared at him seemed to blend into the background, their forms almost camouflaged by the magical light and shadows.
Eddie could feel the weight of the forest's magic pressing in on him. Its power was both awe-inspiring and menacing. His path was a tangled mess of roots and branches. Each step was fraught with the risk of stumbling into hidden traps or dangerous plants. The deeper he went, the more intense the feeling of being watched became—as though the very forest itself were holding its breath, waiting to see what he would do next.
The distant roar of the Nightingale Fox grew louder and more urgent. Eddie quickened his pace, his breath coming in short, measured bursts. He moved with the careful precision of someone who knew the stakes—every noise, every movement, was calculated to avoid drawing unwanted attention.
Eddie emerged from the forest's edge, his breath ragged from the exertion of the chase. He stepped into the ruins of Groville. Wide town square stretched out before him in eerie silence. Broken stone streets and collapsed buildings stood as silent witnesses to the passage of time. He hesitated for only a moment. His instincts took over as his sharp eyes scanned the desolate expanse.
Then the growl echoed again—a low, rumbling sound that shook the ground beneath his feet. Eddie's muscles tensed, and before he could even think, he was running. His footsteps echoed through the empty square. The wide open space now felt like a trap, an open battlefield. The rumble of shifting stone and the grinding noise of something heavy moving through the rubble reached his ears. Catherine. His heart hammered in his chest as he sprinted. The chaotic sound of her transmutation magic filled the air—the sounds of stone being reshaped into something new, something to defend herself.
The growls of the Nightingale Fox were closer now, rising in intensity. The hairs on Eddie's neck stood on end, and he pushed himself harder, desperation fuelling his every stride. He couldn't let her face this alone. The tension in the ruins was palpable, the creatures' eyes fading back into the darkness as if to let Eddie pass. The ruins were a living maze of shadows and uncertainty, its magic swirling around him like a storm. Every step forward brought Eddie closer to the heart of the danger, and the realisation that he was the only one who could save Catherine intensified his resolve. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 7E</Title>
            <Text>The Edenfield Police Department felt nothing like the rest of campus.
Gone were the whimsical arches, the enchanted sconces, the scent of parchment and old spellbooks. Here, the walls were flat stone and the light was sterile, humming faintly overhead from charmed crystals embedded in the ceiling. The waiting room was too large and far too empty, its rows of bolted-down iron chairs left mostly unoccupied, their surfaces cold and uninviting.
A steaming cup of tea would’ve felt absurd here. Even a fire rune would’ve died out from shame.
Eddie sat forward in his chair, elbows on knees, hands clasped so tightly his knuckles had gone white. Across from him, Will tapped his foot, the soft tick-tick-tick filling the silence like a clock running out. Ashley sat between them, shoulders drawn in, her staff across her lap like a protective ward.
Two Paladins flanked the stone archway into the main precinct—tall, gleaming figures in full white steel, faces hidden behind opaque visors. They didn’t move. They didn’t speak. Just stood as if carved from the same walls they guarded, radiant symbols faintly glowing from the glyphwork etched into their armor.
Besides them, there was no one else.
Except Victoria.
She sat apart—one row down, two seats to the left. A deliberate distance. She had her coat draped across her lap, hands folded atop it with eerie stillness. Her blazer still looked pristine. But the shadow under her eyes betrayed something closer to human.
No one had said anything since they arrived.
The air was heavy with grief unspoken. Questions without answers. The kind of silence you didn’t want to break, because it might just shatter you with it.
Eddie stared at the floor. A hairline crack ran through one of the stone tiles.
He couldn’t stop thinking it looked like the ones inside him.
A voice crackled through the intercom on the far wall.“Edward Welton?”
Eddie’s head snapped up.
He rose slowly, the missing person paperwork clutched tightly in his grip. It was still warm from his hands—creased and smudged from where he’d rewritten parts of it, over and over again, as if clearer words could change reality.
Will gave him a nod. Ashley didn’t speak, but her eyes followed him until he reached the desk.
The reception counter loomed under flickering crystallight. Behind the reinforced glass sat a tired-looking officer in navy-blue robes, his badge dulled and his eyes glazed with bureaucratic fatigue. Without looking up, he extended a hand through the opening.
Eddie passed the form through.
The officer glanced over the details, flipped a few pages, then sighed and reached for a stamp. A dull thud echoed as red ink met parchment.
“We’ve logged the case,” the man said flatly. “Estimated processing time is one month.”
“A month? But… she is missing today.”
“We’ve got over three hundred active missing persons reports,” the officer said, finally looking at him. “You’ll be contacted when a field detective is assigned.”
“That’s too long,” Eddie said, his voice rising. “She was taken. This isn’t someone who wandered off. This is different. They’re making Chimaeras. They're experimenting on people—”
“Chimaeras?” The man scoffed. “Right. And maybe dragons are nesting in the west tower again.”
“Look, I’m serious,” Eddie said, stepping closer to the glass. “We saw one. Someone’s continuing the research. They’ve got her.”
The officer’s tone flattened. “The creation of Chimaeras has been outlawed for four hundred years. No confirmed sightings in three centuries. Every known text on the process has been destroyed or locked away in Council vaults. They don’t exist anymore, kid.”
“But they do,” Eddie said, louder now. “I’ve seen one. Madeleine’s missing. Her wand was left behind. There were signs of a struggle. We don’t have a month. She doesn’t have a month—”
“Look,” the man snapped, tapping the form with one ink-stained finger. “I’m telling you what I tell every family that comes through this door: sit tight and wait your turn. We don’t have the manpower to chase fairy tales. You want help? Get in line.”
Eddie stood there, chest heaving, a bitter heat rising in his throat.
The officer let out a tired huff and leaned back in his chair. “Is there anything else,” he asked, voice thick with boredom, “or are you just going to stand there?”
Eddie stared at him for a beat longer—jaw clenched, knuckles white at his sides—then turned without a word.
His footsteps echoed down the polished stone floor as he walked back into the waiting room. The two paladins guarding the doors didn’t flinch. They stood motionless in their gleaming armor, visors down, like statues of judgment watching over a tomb.
Ashley and Will looked up from their seats, expectant—but Eddie didn’t meet their eyes.
Victoria spoke before anyone else could.
“You won’t get anywhere with them,” she said quietly. “Not with the police. Not with a case like this.”
Eddie didn’t respond. Not right away.
He just walked past her.
Through the heavy oak doors. Down the pale marble steps of the Edenfield Police Department.
And into the cold, sleepless city night.

-o-

Eddie sat slumped against the cold stone wall just outside the police department, legs drawn up, arms limp at his sides. The sharp night wind tugged at his jacket, but he didn’t move. Didn’t shiver. Didn’t speak. His eyes stared ahead, glassy and hollow, reflecting nothing but streetlight and the faraway haze of passing carriages.
He looked like someone who’d already buried what mattered.
The heavy doors creaked open behind him.
Ashley stepped out first, followed by Will. Their footsteps slowed when they saw him on the ground.
Ashley’s brow furrowed. She looked down at him, voice tight. “That’s it?”
Eddie didn’t move.
“You’re just going to sit here?” she pressed, sharper now. “Let them do nothing? Let her be gone?”
Will glanced between them, uneasy, but stayed quiet.
Eddie didn’t move. “The police said it themselves. They’re overwhelmed. Missing people all over the place. If even they can’t help... what chance do we have?”
Will lingered behind her, unusually silent.
“She’s gone, Ashley.” Eddie said, letting his head fall back against the stone wall, eyes closing. “It’s over,” 
Ashley stared at him—then dropped to a crouch in front of him, eyes fierce and unwavering. Her staff was still clutched tight in one hand like a torch not yet snuffed.
“No,” she said. “It’s not over.”
“What?” Eddie asked back, “What did you just said?”
“I said, it is not over.”
“Come on,” Eddie said. His voice was low and hoarse, but angry now. “Don’t give me that nonsense. Don’t you see that we’re standing inside a building full of knights and mages trained to uphold the law. Do you see justice served in that building?”
Ashley’s mouth parted slightly, but he didn’t stop.
“You think if we just try hard enough we’ll find her?” His voice cracked. “That we can just charge off into the night and save her like some a hero?”
Will stayed behind them, his expression unreadable.
“You’re not being realistic. You're talking like someone who thinks justice always wins if you just want it hard enough. When you scream enough. But justice doesn’t come because we believe in it. It comes with power, with reach—and we don’t have any of that. We’re just bunch of fucking kids. So let it go, Ashley. We’re not going anywhere with this, It’s over.”
Ashley leaned closer, the wind tousling her wavy brunette hair with blond fades, eyes burning with quiet defiance.
“If you give up. If we give up. Then we’ve lost. We will lose Madeleine.” Her voice caught—just for a moment—but she didn’t look away. “But we haven’t yet.”
“That’s what they want us to do,” she continued, voice burning now. “Wait. Fade. Let the fire go out. But we don’t have to. We don’t have to wait for permission to fight for her.”
Eddie looked at her, something fragile flickering in his eyes.
“You said there’s no hope,” she continued. “But there is. There’s still us. We saw what happened. We know who took her. That’s more than enough to start.”
“You don’t know what’s out there, Ashley.” Eddie said, “If they can create a Chimaera, god knows what else can they do… and you think we can go against something like that?”
She stood, her voice steady and resolute when she said:
“It’s not over if you deem it is not over.”
The words hit Eddie like a pulse through the chest. He’d heard them once before—different place, different pain.
He hadn’t expected to hear them again. 
Not halfway across the continent. In a city so far removed from the corner of the world. And most of all.
He hadn’t expected to hear them from Ashley.
Those words. Her words had pushed him to stand when he wanted to fall and stay on the ground a few years ago.
And now, in some strange, fractured way, she was still pushing him. Not in flesh and voice, but through Ashley, of all people.
Through the echo of a creed he’d thought was buried.
A laugh escaped Eddie’s throat—more morbid than amused. It was ironic. 
He looked at Ashley—her eyes steady, her resolve burning—and in that moment, the old promise rang out louder than the despair threatening to drown him.
Damn you, Catherine. Eddie thought. You never leave me alone, huh.
He tried to rise, muscles stiff and heavy, like dragging himself out of quicksand.
Will and Ashley didn’t hesitate—they each reached out a hand to steady him.
Eddie grasped them, letting their strength pull him upright.
He wiped a hand over his face, eyes searching Ashley’s with a flicker of reluctant hope.
“So,” he said, voice rough but steadying, “What’s the plan? If you’re the one who’s not giving up, I’m betting you’ve got a few tricks left up your sleeve.”
Ashley’s gaze sharpened, determination flaring.
“We’re going to need help moving this faster,” she said quietly, then looked over toward Victoria, who was standing nearby, arms crossed but watching intently.
“Then we need a help from her,” Ashley said, “Her father’s the police chief. Maybe he can push things along, make sure Madeleine’s case doesn’t get buried.”
Eddie’s eyebrows lifted. “Victoria?”
Victoria folded her arms tighter, eyes cold. “Huh? Why would I? My father’s never around. He’s more interested in his own world than anything happening here. In fact, why would I want to do it for any of you?”
Will stepped forward, cutting through the tension like a blade. “Come on, cut the crap.”
He didn’t bother softening his tone.
“I don’t care how much you hate us. But there’s one thing I know for sure—you cared about Madeleine, I see that you are close friends to some sense. Maybe you hate how things went down with us, maybe you hate us, and you don’t trust any of us, but you love Madeleine. Just like we do… Like we all do.”
His voice cracked with urgency, raw and unyielding.
“So put aside whatever disdain you have for us, for whatever grudge you’re holding onto. Help us get her back. Don’t do it for us, do it for her.”
The words hung heavy in the cold air, a desperate plea—and maybe the only chance they had.
Victoria’s eyes flickered, something unreadable breaking through the walls she kept up.</Text>
            <Notes>Eddie, Will and Ashley argued with the EPD about Madeleine’s dissapearance, when they talked, it is revealed that turns out there are so many dissapearance lately

Eddie lost hope

Ashley pep talk

Ashley asked Victoria for help, her father is in the chief, she thinks it will be much faster if Victoria is the one reaching out

Victoria don’t want to do it

But Ashley said to do it for Madeline, not for them. She might had grudge against the three of them, but they know they all love Madeleine, and for once they need to work together

1. - The wait at the police station
2.+ They are called 
3. - The police said it took a month, and when they pressed, the police said that there are numerous of missing people cases, and they are overwhelmed, it will take a while for the detective team to get to Madeleine’s case

4. The trio resigned, Eddie gave up, maybe he is not cut out for any of this. Ashley gave a pep talk that it is not over, if they think it’s not over. Which throws back to Catherine’s advice back when he was in Weshaven

5. Ashley then asked Victoria a favour, since her father is the police chief, he might be able to help it faster,

6. But victoria refused saying why would she do that. Her father was never around, her relationship with her father is not what she expected. But Will said that she should cut the crap. He doesn’t care if she hated them. But one thing for sure that she is a close friend to Madeleine too, she might hate them, but she love Madeleine. Just like how they all love Madeleine, so he begs her to put aside her disdain, and help them get her back

            <Title>Chapter 12</Title>
            <Text>The cobblestones beneath their feet gradually gave way to packed dirt. Catherine's staff's rhythmic clicking softened on the more forgiving ground. Earthy scents of tilled soil and hay replaced the fish markets and harbour smells of salt and brine. Weathered barns with peeling paint stood amidst sprawling fields, and the occasional farmhouse, smoke curling lazily from its chimneys, dotted the horizon.
Eddie walked, the rifle strapped across his back, swaying slightly with his steps. Catherine, ever the scholar, kept stealing glances at the weapon. Finally, her curiosity got the better of her.
&quot;Eddie,&quot; she began, her tone casual but probing, &quot;I've been meaning to ask about that flintlock of yours. It's not exactly what you see every day, especially for someone working at an apothecary.&quot;
Eddie sighed lightly as though he had anticipated the question. &quot;It's more of a hand-me-down, I guess,&quot; he said, adjusting the strap on his shoulder. &quot;Back when Weshaven was still full of wolves and wild animals, Dad taught my brother Alfred how to use it. Alfred would go into the woods and scare off anything too close to the farms. Sometimes, he'd even shoot them if they were too bold.&quot;
Torrie, who had been eavesdropping, piped up with wide-eyed enthusiasm. &quot;Wait, like actual wolves? Did Alfred ever fight one off?&quot;
Eddie chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;No, it never got that dramatic. Most of the time, the sound of the shot was enough to send them running.&quot;
&quot;Boo,&quot; Torrie pouted, twirling her wand idly. &quot;I thought we were finally hearing a good action story.&quot;
Catherine tilted her head, her gaze flicking back to the rifle. &quot;And now? I assume there aren't any wolves around anymore.&quot;
&quot;Not really,&quot; Eddie replied. &quot;There's a Hunting Guild that takes care of stuff like that. They meet at the Swordfish Pub. They keep the area safe, so I haven't had to use this thing in ages. Honestly, it's just been collecting dust.&quot;
&quot;So why bring it now?&quot; Catherine pressed, a note of curiosity creeping into her tone.
Eddie shrugged, a small, sheepish smile forming. &quot;Because it's cool.&quot;
Catherine couldn't hold back her laughter this time. Her composed facade broke for a moment. Eddie smirked, shaking his head at Torrie's antics.
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he said, his voice edged with mock exasperation. &quot;Let's just hope none of you are begging me for help when something shows up.&quot;
Markus clapped Eddie on the back, his grin widening. &quot;If something does, I'll ask the bard in Swordfish to make a song about you. 'Eddie Welton and the Rusty Rifle.' Has a nice ring, doesn't it?&quot;
The group's laughter echoed across the dirt road. The distant lowing of cows and the rustling of leaves in the breeze filled the air. However, the tension of the morning still lingered in Eddie's mind. He couldn't help but feel a flicker of warmth amidst the camaraderie.
-o-
As they ventured into the gathering dusk, the world around them grew quieter. Their footsteps and the distant calls of seabirds were the sounds they could hear. The path ahead was long, and the mysteries of the Deep Glaive awaited.
The path they had been following gave way to a darker earth. The cobblestones disappear beneath layers of fallen leaves. Catherine's party is approaching the edge of the Deep Glaive. The sun was now just a sliver on the horizon, casting the last rays of daylight through the trees. As they drew nearer, the forest ahead seemed almost unremarkable—a small cluster of trees, their branches swaying gently in the evening breeze.
But as they crossed the threshold into the forest, the air seemed to shift. It became cooler, denser, and more vibrant. The small, unassuming trees began to grow taller. Their trunks thickened, and their canopies stretched higher into the sky. The underbrush, once sparse, now teemed with strange, luminescent flora, casting an otherworldly glow on the path ahead.
Catherine was the first to react, her eyes widening in astonishment as she took in the sight before her. &quot;Look at it... It's more incredible than I imagined.&quot; Awe filled her voice, each word a reverent whisper. She stepped forward, her fingers lightly grazing the bark of a nearby tree, which seemed to pulse gently beneath her touch. &quot;I've read about the Deep Glaive in countless texts, but seeing it in person... It's like stepping into another world.&quot;
Torrie, who had been trailing behind her, was equally mesmerised. Her gaze darted from one glowing plant to the next, and her hands were itching to gather samples. &quot;It's like the trees are alive... I mean, really alive,&quot; she murmured, her voice tinged with the wonder of a child seeing magic for the first time. She turned to Catherine, her eyes sparkling. Catherine, can we collect some of these? Just imagine the experiments we could conduct!&quot;
Catherine chuckled softly, her earlier playful demeanour returning as she nodded. &quot;Yes, but let's not be too hasty, Torrie. People know the Deep Glaive for its beauty, but also its dangers. We must tread carefully.&quot;
Markus, who had been lingering at the back, stepped forward. Quiet reverence replaced his usually cheerful expression. He glanced around, his eyes wide with both fear and fascination. &quot;I didn't expect it to be so... vast. It's like the forest goes on forever.&quot; He let out a shaky breath, rubbing the back of his neck as he tried to steady his nerves.
Eddie stood apart from the others. He watched their reactions with a sense of detachment. He had read about the Deep Glaive in his academy days and studied its mysteries. His younger self would have been giddy with excitement. He would be eager to explore every inch of this magical place. But now, as he looked around at the towering trees and the glowing plants, he felt a dull sense of indifference.
It's just a forest, he thought to himself. Trees, plants, maybe a few magical creatures—nothing special.
He knew the theory behind the forest's strange properties. Its size was an illusion, and it seemed to stretch endlessly for those who ventured inside. But knowing the how and why stripped away the wonder. He saw what others saw as extraordinary as simply the result of magical phenomena he had once been so passionate about, now reduced to nothing more than trivial facts in his mind.
Catherine turned to him, her eyes still wide with excitement. &quot;Eddie, isn't this just amazing? I remember how you used to talk about places like this when you were a child. You were always so eager to see them for yourself.&quot;
Eddie forced a smile, nodding politely. &quot;It's impressive, I suppose.&quot;
Catherine blinked, surprised by his lack of enthusiasm. She studied him momentarily as if trying to reconcile the man before her with the boy she remembered. &quot;Still, there's something magical about being here in person, don't you think?&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eddie shrugged, his expression neutral. &quot;I think so.&quot;
Catherine, undeterred by Eddie's indifference, smiled warmly at the group. &quot;Alright, let's not waste any more time. We've got work to do, and the Deep Glaive won't wait for us. Stay close, and remember—this forest may be beautiful, but it's also unpredictable.&quot;
As they ventured deeper into the forest. Catherine and Torrie continued to marvel at their surroundings. Markus followed closely, his nerves slowly easing as he became more accustomed to the strange sights around him.
Eddie walked a few steps behind, his rifle still slung across his back, his gaze focused ahead. He knew there were wonders in the Deep Glaive that would have once thrilled him beyond measure. But now, they were just another reminder of the life he had left behind and the magic he no longer cared to understand. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1</Title>
            <Text>The clock ticked.
A hollow, relentless sound, like a fingernail tapping against glass. Then the scrape of pencils—nervous, hurried—etching answers onto paper. A cough. The rustle of someone shifting in their seat. The slow, deliberate click-clack of the teacher’s shoes as he paced between rows, his shadow stretching long under the flickering fluorescent lights.
At the back of the room, a boy with unruly brunette hair and jade-green eyes stared at his exam paper, his fingers tight around his pencil. His maroon jumper was rumpled, sleeves pushed up to his elbows, and his brown jacket slumped over the back of his chair like a discarded second skin. The numbers and formulas blurred in front of him, not because he didn’t know them, but because the silence was too loud.
Tick.
The boy’s knee bounced under the desk. His pencil hovered over question four—Calculate the molar mass of sulfuric acid—but his mind was elsewhere. The clock’s ticking had become a drumbeat, syncing with his pulse. A bead of sweat traced his temple.
Tock.
Someone whispered two rows ahead. The teacher’s shoes stopped. A sharp inhale. The whisperer fell silent.
Eddie answered the first few questions with ease—stoichiometry, balancing equations, nothing he hadn’t done before. His pencil moved in quick, confident strokes. But then, as always, his focus began to slip.
The graphite tip against paper wasn’t just graphite anymore. He could see it—the layers of carbon, the way the atoms locked together in hexagonal lattices, the faint, shimmering resonance of electrons dancing between them. His vision tunneled, the classroom fading at the edges.
His gaze drifted upward, past the exam paper, past the rows of bent heads, to the window. The sky wasn’t just blue—it was a swirling sea of oxygen molecules, nitrogen, the occasional rogue pollutant from a passing car’s exhaust. Sunlight didn’t just shine; it collided with the air, scattering, bending, turning the atmosphere into a living, shifting prism.
&quot;Mr. Welton?&quot;
The voice barely registered. He was too busy watching the way oxygen split and recombined under the sun’s insistence, how the light fractured into wavelengths his eyes weren’t supposed to parse.
&quot;Mr. Welton?&quot; Louder this time.
A nudge at his shoulder—sharp, insistent.
Eddie blinked. The classroom snapped back into focus.
Twenty pairs of eyes stared at him.
The pencil in his hand was just a pencil again. The sky outside the window was just sky.
The teacher stood over his desk, lips pressed thin. &quot;Please focus on the exam at hand, Mr. Welton,&quot; he said, voice dry as chalk dust. &quot;The test ends in five minutes. It is not the best time to dilly-dally about.&quot;
Eddie’s throat tightened. &quot;Um. Yes, sir.&quot;
He looked back at his paper. Question six was still half-finished.
His fingers trembled.
The clock ticked.
And beneath the silence, the world kept whispering.

-o-

The bell rang, sharp and impatient. Chairs scraped against linoleum as students surged toward the front of the classroom, exam papers in hand. Eddie stayed seated, watching the scramble with detached amusement. There was no point in joining the fray—he’d rather wait until the crowd thinned, until the last possible moment. It wasn’t patience. It was something worse: a habit of making himself small, of stepping aside even when there was no reason to.
One by one, the students handed their papers to Mr. Turing, who stood by his desk with the weary air of a man who had graded one too many exams. He offered a nod or a tired smile to each of them as they passed.
&quot;Good effort, Patel.&quot;
&quot;Solid work, Li. Watch your sig figs next time.&quot;
A girl with a high ponytail paused as she handed in her test. &quot;What’s the next unit, Mr. Turing?&quot;
Mr. Turing rubbed his temple. &quot;Electrochemistry. Batteries, corrosion—the fun stuff.&quot; He said it like a man announcing a root canal.
Eddie finally stood when the last student ahead of him had gone. He approached, paper extended. Mr. Turing took it, glanced at the half-blank final page, then back up at Eddie with a raised eyebrow.
&quot;So,&quot; he said, leaning against the desk, &quot;what was so fascinating out that window? A bird? A UFO? Or were you just contemplating the meaning of life instead of finishing question six?&quot;
Eddie adjusted the strap of his satchel. &quot;Plane,&quot; he said. &quot;Low-flying. Thought it was going to crash for a second.&quot;
Mr. Turing snorted. &quot;Right. And I suppose next you’ll tell me you were calculating its velocity mid-flight instead of your reaction yields.&quot;
&quot;Something like that.&quot;
&quot;Mhm.&quot; Mr. Turing didn’t look convinced, but he waved a hand. &quot;Get out of here, Welton. Try not to get distracted by the air on your way home.&quot;
Eddie turned, relief already loosening his shoulders—
&quot;Actually,&quot; Mr. Turing said.
His voice had changed.
Eddie looked back.
The teacher’s expression was no longer amused. He folded his arms, hesitated, then spoke slowly, like he was choosing each word with care.
&quot;Stay behind a minute. We need to talk.&quot;
Eddie turned. &quot;What is it, Mr. Turing?&quot;
The teacher’s face was unreadable—somewhere between surprise and confusion, his brows slightly furrowed, lips pressed into a thin line. He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he gestured toward Eddie’s desk.
&quot;Come here.&quot;
Eddie stepped forward, his pulse suddenly loud in his ears. Mr. Turing held out the exam paper.
&quot;Care to explain this, Mr. Welton?&quot;
Eddie took it.
And froze.
The answers he remembered writing—neat chemical equations, balanced formulas—were gone. In their place were sprawling, circular diagrams, intricate and archaic, like something out of an alchemist’s manuscript. The handwriting wasn’t his. Or, at least, it didn’t feel like his—the letters were sharp, angular, inked in a script that looked like Latin but twisted with symbols he didn’t recognize. Glyphs curled at the margins, spiraling into the corners of the page.
His stomach lurched.
No. No, I wrote the answers. I know I did.
He flipped the paper over, as if expecting to find his real work on the other side. But the entire exam was like this—every question answered in this strange, esoteric language.
&quot;I... I answered them,&quot; Eddie said, his voice thin. &quot;I could’ve sworn I wrote something else.&quot;
Mr. Turing exhaled through his nose. &quot;Yeah? So they just magically turned into this 18th-century script?&quot;
Eddie’s fingers tightened on the paper. &quot;I don’t know.&quot;
The classroom was too quiet. The clock’s ticking was suddenly oppressive.
&quot;Right,&quot; Mr. Turing sighed, rubbing his temple. *&quot;I suppose I don’t understand Latin nor 18th-century script. But you still remember your answers, don’t you?&quot;*
&quot;Yeah, I do, sir.&quot; Eddie’s voice was steady, but his fingers twitched at his sides.
&quot;Go on, then.&quot; Mr. Turing tapped the paper. &quot;What’s the answer for number one?&quot;
Question 1: Balance the following chemical equation: __H₂ + O₂ → H₂O
Eddie didn’t hesitate. *&quot;2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O.&quot;*
Mr. Turing’s pen scratched against the paper as he marked it correct.
&quot;Number two.&quot;
Question 2: Calculate the molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
*&quot;98.08 g/mol.&quot;*
Another mark.
They continued like this—question after question, Eddie answering flawlessly, his voice calm even as his mind raced.
Question 7: What is the ideal gas law?&quot;PV = nRT.&quot;
Question 12: Define Hess’s Law.&quot;The enthalpy change of a reaction is the same regardless of the pathway taken.&quot;
Question 18: A 0.5M solution of NaCl has a volume of 2L. How many moles of NaCl are present?&quot;1 mole.&quot;
By the time they reached Question 20—Draw the Lewis structure for carbon dioxide—Eddie didn’t even need to describe it. He traced the shape in the air with his finger: &quot;Linear. Double bonds between C and each O.&quot;
Mr. Turing stared at the paper, then at Eddie. &quot;By God,&quot; he muttered. &quot;These are all correct.&quot; His eyes narrowed. &quot;How could you possibly have done this?&quot;
Eddie opened his mouth. The truth—I don’t know—would only dig him deeper. So he grasped for the least believable excuse possible.
&quot;I... I’ve watched it on the internet.&quot;
A beat of silence.
Mr. Turing blinked. &quot;You learned how to do modern chemistry... with ancient methods... from the internet?&quot;
&quot;Yes... sir.&quot; Even Eddie winced at how thin it sounded.
Then—unexpectedly—Mr. Turing burst into laughter. A deep, wheezing sound that filled the empty classroom. &quot;You kids nowadays,&quot; he managed, shaking his head. &quot;Always find a way to baffle me.&quot;
Eddie exhaled, shoulders loosening. &quot;So, um. Did I pass?&quot;
Mr. Turing wiped his eyes, still chuckling. &quot;As much as I don’t want to, I’ll give you a C- on this one. You’re correct on everything, but please use a more up-to-date method next exam, yeah?&quot;
&quot;Yes, sir. Sorry.&quot;
&quot;It’s alright.&quot; Mr. Turing waved him off, still grinning. &quot;You can go home now, Mr. Welton. Have a good evening.&quot;
Eddie grabbed his bag and bolted before the teacher could change his mind.
The symbols on the paper lingered in his mind.
They hadn’t come from the internet.
And he had no idea where they had come from.</Text>

            <Text>His breath is still rugged as he panted, he took a long deep breath.
He stood beneath the dim lights of the gas lamps, his breath still heavy from the adrenaline of the brawl.
He looked down at the wand in his hand, a mixture of disbelief and relief flooding through him. The smooth, slender stick of wood had pulled him out of yet another mess—a mess that could’ve ended with him face down in the wooden floorboards.
He chuckled to himself, the sound almost incredulous. Alchemy, he thought, had just saved his skin.
“God damn it,” he muttered under his breath, “I could never fucking escape using you, huh.” grinning to himself.
“Nice feeling, isn’t it?”
A voice called out, cutting through Eddie’s reverie. He spun around, his heart giving an unexpected lurch. Standing in the shadows, her figure framed by the lamplight,
Catherine stood in the alleyway. Her lips curled into a teasing smile as she stepped forward, illuminated by the gas lamps, her eyes gleaming with amusement.
“You know, the Alamirian Merchants are right about one thing. Eavesdropping isn’t exactly the most polite thing, Edward.” she said, her voice light and playful, her tone teasing.
Eddie blinked. Of course, he thought. She was always a step ahead.
“Come,” she said, stepping closer. “Let’s get away from this mess.”
Eddie glanced back at the ruckus now spilling out of the pub door. The sounds of shouting and scuffling still echoed through the streets.
He let out a long breath and pocketed Torrie’s school-issued wand into his pants pocket.
“Sure,” he replied with a reluctant sigh. “I could use a walk.”
With a graceful turn, Catherine began walking down the street.
Eddie followed.
 
-o-
 
As they walked, the streets seemed quieter now. Save for the distant clink of metal and breaking wood from the pub’s brawl muffled behind them.
Catherine, however, seemed to be deep in thought. After a while, she broke the quiet.
“Do you remember that day at the dining table when I first arrived?”
“Vaguely,” he replied.
“You said you were working on something.&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;You are working for your advanced magical education in the Universities,” she continued.
&quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; Eddie lied.
“And when I asked if you were considering applying for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship, you said yes.”
&quot;Yeah, I am.&quot; Eddie continued his lie.
“But you’re not, are you, Edward?” She continued, 
Eddie stopped his track, the wind continues to howl, there is no point in hiding it anymore
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eddie said, admitting the truth
“Why lie?&quot; Catherine stopped, looked back towards Eddie, her voice soft, &quot;I know you have so much ambition for Alchemy, but now you act like it’s something to run from.”
Eddie froze, his jaw tightened. He couldn’t do this—not with Catherine, not now. She was pressing on a wound he wasn’t ready to open.
But Catherine wasn’t about to let it go. She had always been the type to ask the hard questions, to dig until she found the truth, unlike him, she is an Alchemist, a real Alchemist, and like an Alchemist she will dig the truth. 
“I might not be around by the time you enrolled in Aella Academy,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but insistent. “But I was around when you’re so passionate about your first transmutation, when you’re going to ruins and dungeons retracing the steps of famous Alchemists, when you said you wanted to go to Edenfield University to become an Alchemist.”
“You used to be so passionate about Alchemy.  What happened?” Her eyes searched his face, hoping to understand the change she couldn’t quite place. 
He couldn’t tell her. He couldn’t tell anyone.
“Fifteen years, Eddie.” Catherine’s voice broke through his spiralling thoughts, “Fifteen years is nothing for someone like me. But for you... for you, I know it must have felt like a lifetime. Something happened to you during those years I was gone, something that changes you.”
He kept his gaze forward, avoiding Catherine's eyes; the words swirling in his mind but not forming on his tongue. How could he explain the loss, the guilt, the fear? How could he explain the day he had ruined his life—and someone else’s—forever?
He still couldn’t tell her. He still couldn’t tell anyone.
Finally, she sighed. “Look, I’m not going to pretend I understand what happened to you, because I certainly don’t. But I do know that you’ve changed.”

—=--
“And not in a good way.” Catherine continued, “You’re not the person I knew, you’re not the person Torrie knew. You’ve built up walls around yourself, and from what I’ve seen, it’s tearing you apart-”
“Just drop it.” Eddie interrupted, still trying to keep a polite smile.
“I beg your pardon?” Catherine responded
“Just drop it.” Eddie said with more resolution, his voice now laden with more frustation, “People has been prying on that fact, Eddie why are you not doing alchemy anymore? Eddie why aren’t you doing your transmutation anymore? Eddie where is your passion in Alchemy?”
Eddie stood there, his smile fading, he is not trying to be polite anymore, he is not lying anymore, “I’m sick of it. I’m not interested in Alchemy anymore, okay? I’m sick of people bringing it up, I’m sick of Alchemy. So please, Catherine. Just fucking drop it.”
Catherine stood there clearly taken aback, Eddie expected for her to get offended, then throwing him a three hour lecture about the importance of Alchemy, but then, she just smiled, a teasing smile as if she just found something amusing.
“I see,” Catherine finally said, sighing, crossing her arms, “Fine by me, then. I’ll drop the topic.”
A sense of ease fills Eddie, finally, some peace and quiet, no more prying, no more question-
“But I will only drop the topic only if you can drop your act.”
Eddie stood there, his heart lurching.
“What do you mean?”
“Don’t you see yourself, Edward?” Catherine said, now turning towards the pier, her arms resting on its wooden railing, “If you’re truly disinterested in Alchemy… sick of it, even.”
She then turned her head, facing Eddie, her short hair blown by the cold, sea breeze, “Then why keep working on it?”
“I see the formula you perfected up in Robert’s tower, Edward.” Catherine continued, “The homeworks you’ve helped Torrie with, and how it increased her grade significantly.”
“And don’t even get me started with your room.” Catherine continued, now turning her body, still leaning to the wooden railing, “The transmutation circles you’ve designed in your spare time, the copies of Alchemical tomes scattered on your desk, how you tried to continue your research from Aella Academy.”
Catherine opened her arms, “Why do all of that, if you’re sick of it?” 
Catherine now puts her hands back on her coat’s pocket, “I would’ve let you slide if you truly, truly hate it, Edward, sure. But the fact is that you doesn’t. You still have that passion roaring deep within you that you tried to suppress, you’re playing an act of hating Alchemy whilst the fact that you still love it. That, I can’t stand.”
“Then what do you want me to do?” Eddie asked, chuckling sarcastically, his voice low, his eyes finally meeting hers. “Do you want me just to get back to it? Pick it up again like nothing happened?”
Catherine stood there for a moment, leaning against the pier.
“I wished you were, but i know it’s not that simple, is it?” Her gaze steady, and then she gave him a small, determined smile. “So I’m offering you something different.”
Catherine stood there, the wind blows her short apple-red hair, her red coat flutters in the cold evening breeze like a flag of declaration, the silhouette of her sharp elven ear made the whole scene felt like a fairy tale. She then looked at Eddie's eyes, taking her hand out of her pocket, and raising it, and points it straight at his face.
“I’m offering you an adventure,”
“What?” Eddie blinked, chuckled slightly in confusion. “What are you even talking about?&quot;
&quot;I'm offering you an Adventure for you to be a part of.&quot; Catherine said, her voice steady and firm. “There’s an Artefact hidden deep within the illusory forest of The Deep Glaive. I could use a fellow Alchemist like you.&quot; She smiled, &quot;It'll be like the old days, isn't it?”
“A fellow, is a hard stretch don’t you think, Catherine?” Eddie chuckled, his face sombre, “It can't be like the old days, you know? I’m not that kid anymore, Catherine,” he said quietly. “I can’t be that kid.”
“Of course you're not, you'll never be. You don’t have to be that kid.” Catherine’s light blue eyes stared at his with piercing gaze.
“You just need to be you.”
Eddie looked into her eyes, seeing the earnestness in her gaze. An invitation, a chance to leave behind his regrets and step back into something larger than himself.
He didn’t have an answer right away. But in the silence that followed, he knew that Catherine wasn’t going to let him walk away from this, not that easily. Not when she knew something about him.
“I don’t know,” Eddie said.
“It’s okay,” Catherine said, now continuing her pace, Eddie followed, the cadence of their footsteps echoes through the hard cobblestone road, “But you don’t have to lie anymore, it’s futile. You can lie all you want to Torrie, to Markus, Alyssa, Robert. But one thing for certain.”
“You can’t lie to a fellow Alchemist.”</Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 17 V2</Title>
            <Text>As Markus and Catherine went outside the perimeter of the Eden Flowers, Eddie and Torrie settled down at the side of the Traveller’s Path. The glowing Eden Flowers cast a gentle, golden light over the path, creating a serene atmosphere amidst the dense darkness of the Deep Glaive. 
Eddie sat next to Torrie on the edge of the path, his gaze fixed on the flickering lights of the Eden Flowers. On the other hand, Torrie focused on a more delicate task. She deftly wove Eden Flowers into a crown, her small fingers moving with practised ease.
 “So, Torrie,” Eddie began, filling the silence. “How do you feel about seeing Catherine again?”
Torrie looked up from her flower crown.
“I’m happy.” She said, “Not every day you meet someone with so much knowledge and experience. Aunt Catherine has travelled far and studied so much. Being able to learn from her is fascinating.”
“Yeah,” Eddie flashed a faint smile “it’s... good to see her again.”
Torrie’s smile widened slightly but didn’t reach her eyes as much as before. 
“And what about you? How do you feel about meeting her again?”
“It’s alright.”
“Just that?” Torrie’s smile faltered, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Eddie’s face.  “Nothing else fascinates you about her return?”
Eddie’s smile faded, and he looked away, his expression suddenly distant.
“It’s just... seeing her again is... cool… She’s awesome.” Eddie replied. He glanced at Torrie, whose previously bright demeanour had now shifted to something more serious.
Torrie’s eyes searched his face, her gaze intense. “Are you telling me that’s all there is to it? You don’t feel anything else about her returning after all this time?”
Eddie shifted uncomfortably. “It’s not like that. I just... I don’t know.”
Torrie’s smile had vanished entirely, replaced by a frown of concern and confusion. “Eddie, I thought you’d be more... interested. You used to look up to her so much when we were young!”
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the side, avoiding her piercing gaze. “Maybe. I don’t know.”
Torrie’s fingers paused mid-motion with the flower crown, her face a mask of frustration and somewhat hurt.
The Eden Flowers glowed softly. Their light cast long shadows that danced across their faces. The once-comforting glow now seemed to highlight the distance growing between them.
Torrie finally broke the silence, her voice quiet but firm. “If you’re not interested in seeing what’s different, then...” Her voice ceded down
 “why are you even here?”

-o-

The moonlight pierced through the dense canopy of the Deep Glaive, casting jagged patterns across the forest floor. Twisted vines and ancient trees loomed like sentinels, their gnarled forms seeming almost alive in the shifting light. The forest was oppressively silent, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant, haunting call of some unseen creature. 

Catherine walked through the darkness of the forest, lit up by a white glow she conjured from her staff, Markus is following behind her, his grip tight on Eddie’s flintlock rifle. The weapon was raised, its polished barrel glinting faintly in the pale light. Every whisper of movement sent his heart racing, his eyes darting toward every shadow. At the slightest rustle of a bush, the rifle twitched in his hands, his finger hovering dangerously close to the trigger. 

“You haven’t answered my question, Markus.” Catherine said, her eyes still forward.

“Look, ma’am. I’m here because Eddie clearly don’t want to!” Markus groaned, “In fact, I’m clearly a better shot than he is!” 

“But you clearly looked scared,” Catherine said, brushing the bushes out of her way with her staff, “You’re holding that thing like we’re about to be ambushed by an army of bandits.” 

“Easy for you to joke, ma’am!” Markus lowered the rifle but kept it ready. “You’ve got magic and stuff! I’ve got only this—and it’s not exactly comforting.” He gave the rifle a wary look as if it might betray him at any moment. 

“We’ll be fine.” Catherine said, her voice quiet but steady. “I’ve been through worse, believe me. And I promise you, we won’t be facing it alone if anything comes at us. Beasts this centuries tend to be much more smaller in size, so it will be a piece of cake.”

 “Alright,” he muttered. “One centuries old or one week old, I’m still keeping this thing ready.”  

They continued deeper into the forest. The silence between them seemed to press in even closer, distant howls and rustles of bushes are the only thing they could hear, the darkness growing thicker. Catherine kept her senses sharp, but sensing Markus’s unease, she knows he needed something to keep his mind off his surroundings.

“You know,” she began, her tone conversational, “I used to visit Eddie’s home a lot when he was younger. We’d go adventuring in ancient dungeons, exploring caves and abandoned ruins. But an illusory forest is definitely first for me in ages.” 

“Really?” Markus glanced at her, his face pale. “Yeah, I remember Eddie used to talk a lot about his adventures in the dungeons, that was what made him quite popular at school.” 

“Was he now?” Catherine chuckled. “Eddie used to love going off the path, treading the path uncharted. He was always adventurous, seeking new experiences, no matter the danger.”

“We’d found ourselves in trouble countless times,” Catherine continued, “But Eddie always seemed to enjoy the thrill of it. His older brother Alfred and I often had to help him out of those troubles he got himself in.” 

“Yeah…” Markus said, “That was also the Eddie I remembered, he’s so reckless, even when he was school.”

“Hm?” Catherine said, curious, “You talk as if we are talking about two different person. What’s the matter with the Eddie we are with now?”

“Eddie now...” Markus sighed,  “He seems different. He doesn’t seem like the same person.” 

“Different? “Catherine’s smile faded slightly as she looked at Markus. “How so?” 

“Didn’t you know he was expelled?”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3.5E V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Madeleine walked deeper into the Sanctuary, the mood began to shift. Near the front, sunlight still touched the fences and grassy paths, where Sanctuary members were leading tours for wide-eyed elementary-aged students in matching cloaks. A small group clustered near a gentle, antlered beast with scales like polished stone, giggling as it bowed to let them pet its snout.
Farther along, two caretakers were gently helping an older couple onto the back of a large, feathery creature. It had the wide, watchful eyes of an owl, a powerful bear-like body covered in dappled down, and tucked at its sides—massive, elegant wings folded like cloaks. The creature gave a low, soothing hoot as it crouched to let the riders on, its claws curling into the grass with surprising care.
It moved with the softness of snowfall, each step deliberate, like it was trying not to startle the breeze.
Madeleine nudged him. “Not a nightmare after all, hm?”
“Yeah, I guess so.” Eddie said, but his eyes stayed on the retreating wings. “But I didn’t think Professor Hudson for the type to volunteer here,” he said abruptly. “That man acts like he’d sanitize his hands after petting a puppy or something.”
“He’s head of the Sanctuary’s research program. Has been for years.” Her voice was measured, the way she explained things to spooked animals—gentle but firm. 
“His connections at the university and the Alchemy Ingredients Warehouse keep our supplies stocked.” She continued, “Without him, half the creatures here wouldn’t get their specialized tonics in time.”
Eddie snorted. “Yeah, but does he actually like them? Or are they just… I don’t know, test subjects for him?”
She laughed, “I took his Botanical Alchemy course this year. He’s… meticulous. But people aren’t just one thing, Edward.” A pause, her gaze drifting toward the Back Range. “The man who lectures on ‘precision over passion’ also hand-feeds sugar cubes to the hippogriffs when he thinks no one’s looking.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “You’re telling me that man has a hidden side we don’t know?”
“I’m telling you,” she said, turning to lead him down the path, “That no one is as it seems.”
As they walked deeper into the sanctuary, the cheerful sounds began to fade, replaced by the hush of thickening woods. The trees here grew denser, the canopy forming a living roof that swallowed the sun. The air turned cooler, stiller, and more humid. Eddie noticed the path narrowing as vines and moss crept along the edges, and the sound of their footfalls became muffled on the leafy ground.
Madeleine glanced back at him. “This is part of the containment,” she said. “The trees are grown close on purpose—enchanted and cultivated this way. Nothing with wings can take off easily in here.”
Eddie blinked. “As in… this forest is acting as its cage?”
“A forest as a safety net,” Madeleine corrected gently. “A soft one. The creatures don’t feel trapped, but it keeps everyone safe. Including the creatures.”
They finally stepped into the Back Range, marked by a simple wooden arch wrapped in glowing vines. The shadows here were thick, and the only light came from hanging lanterns and fruits that glowed softly like moonlight—violet, blue, and faintly golden.
Many of the enclosures were hidden by dark fabrics or veils of moss. Muffled growls and low, thudding breaths rumbled from behind them, unseen but deeply felt. One enclosure bore claw marks on the bark of the trees surrounding it, but no sign of the creature inside.
Madeleine’s expression grew somber. “These ones are all recovering,” she said softly. “Most of them were pulled from military use. Trained, abused, pushed past their limits. They weren’t made for war—but they were used like weapons.”
Eddie looked around, his gaze flicking from veil to lantern to the faint glow of eyes peering through a curtain of vines. “So they’re injured?”
“Body and spirit,” she said. “Some are still too aggressive to be handled. Others…” She paused. “Others just need someone to sit near them and remind them they’re not tools.”
The silence that followed was heavier than before. Around them, the woods seemed to watch.
And as they moved forward, Eddie began to see more of the creatures—strange, otherworldly, and awe-inspiring. A towering quadruped with armor-like plates over its shoulders huffed in its sleep. A translucent, almost ghostly winged cat with double pupils crept along the high branches. A half-curled serpent with burning red eyes followed them with its gaze from behind a thick enchanted net.
Eddie gripped his crutch tighter. “Remind me again why we’re walking towards the terrifying creatures?”
Madeleine smirked. “Because you need to see one of them.”
She led Eddie off the path, up a wooden ramp that creaked under their feet, toward one of the enclosed indoor glass sanctuaries tucked between the thick roots of the forest. The structure was built into the trees, its windows fogged and dark, blending into the woodland like a secret hidden in plain sight.
The air inside was cool and still, carrying the metallic tang of blood and the faint, sharp scent of ozone. The cheerful sounds of the front range were gone, replaced by a deep, resonant silence broken only by the sound of their own footsteps and the occasional low, guttural breath from behind the glass.
They walked past the first enclosure. A plaque of polished brass was bolted to the frame.
Calderan Wyvern – Draco Minor Caldarea Status: Rehabilitating. Warning: Corrosive Spittle. Do not approach glass.
Through the murky pane, Eddie could see a serpentine shape coiled in the shadows, its scales shimmering like oil on water. A low hiss, like steam from a cracked pipe, followed them as they passed.
The next plaque read:
Ridgeback Manticore – Manticora Spina Status: Highly Aggressive. Warning: Auditory Lures in Use. Maintain Silence.
A pair of intelligent, cruel eyes tracked them from the darkness within. Eddie felt a prickle on his skin, a primal instinct screaming at him that he was being sized up as prey. He quickened his pace, his crutch thudding heavily on the wooden boards.
They passed another—an Obsidian Basilisk, its petrifying gaze neutralized by the enchanted glass, according to the plaque. Then a cage that housed a creature so massive, all Eddie could see was a wall of thick, grey hide pressed against the window, rising and falling with each thunderous breath. Each enclosure held a monster from a nightmare, a creature of immense power, barely contained.
Finally, they reached the end of the walkway. The final enclosure was set apart from the others. It was smaller, starker, and reinforced with bands of cold, black iron etched with glowing containment runes. The air here was frigid, and a profound silence emanated from it—not the quiet of a sleeping predator, but the absolute stillness of a tomb.
Madeleine stopped, her expression grim. She didn't have to point. Eddie's eyes were already fixed on the plaque. The lettering was simpler, less scientific. It was a label born of fear, not study.
The Spike Man – Chimaera
Eddie’s breath caught. He remembered Madeleine’s story—the creature found outside the city, mangled and wrong. He looked past the plaque, into the enclosure, expecting to see a taxidermied body, a skeleton, something.
There was nothing.
The enclosure was empty. A stark, sterile, stone-floored cell.
No, not sterile. Eddie leaned closer, his hand instinctively going to the glass, which was ice-cold to the touch. The stone walls, the floor, even the reinforced ceiling—they were utterly shredded. Thousands upon thousands of claw marks gouged the surfaces, overlapping in a chaotic frenzy. The marks were deep, frantic, etched with a desperation so palpable it seemed to echo in the silence. This wasn't just an enclosure; it was a torture chamber. This creature hadn’t just lived here; it had spent every waking moment trying to tear its way out.
&quot;I thought you said it died,&quot; Eddie whispered, his voice hoarse. He couldn't tear his eyes away from the sheer violence carved into the stone.
&quot;It did,&quot; Madeleine said softly, her voice tight with a sorrow so deep it seemed to chill the air further. &quot;It screamed for a whole night. And then it just… stopped. This is where we kept it.&quot;
Eddie stared into the empty, ravaged cell. The violence of the claw marks told a story of unimaginable pain. The silence pressed in on him, heavy with the ghost of that final scream.
“What… what did it look like?” he finally asked, his voice barely a whisper.
Madeleine let out a long, slow sigh, as if the question itself was a physical weight. She seemed reluctant, not wanting to revisit the memory, but she reached for the small leather satchel at her hip anyway. With deliberate movements, she unbuckled it and pulled out a thick, leather-bound journal. The cover was worn smooth at the edges from years of use.
She opened it, and Eddie saw pages filled with immaculate handwriting, detailed anatomical sketches, and carefully pressed specimens. As she flipped through, he caught glimpses of a gryphon’s wing diagram, notes on the migratory patterns of hippogriffs, and a shimmering, translucent scale taped to a page labeled Sea Serpent. Each entry was a testament to a lifetime of fascination.
Then, she stopped. The page she landed on was different. It was chaotic.
Her usually neat handwriting was jagged, filled with more questions than answers. Lines were crossed out. Margins were filled with frantic queries: Necromantic origin? Alchemical mutation? Inconsistent biology? Forced cross-breeding? In the top corner, under &quot;Classification,&quot; a list of names had been aggressively struck through—Undead, Aberration, Revenant—before she had finally, uncertainly, circled the word: Chimaera.
But it was the photograph that held Eddie’s attention.
It was a stamped polaroid, slightly faded, showing the creature’s corpse laid out on a steel table. It looked like a painfully thin man, so gaunt its ribs were starkly visible beneath pale, stretched skin. Its arms were unnaturally long, ending in sharp, black talons. And from its spine and the back of its skull erupted a dense crown of sharp, black spikes, like those of a monstrous hedgehog. It was a horrifying fusion of humanoid and something else entirely. The &quot;Spike Man.&quot;
Madeleine’s voice was quiet, tense. “Is this what attacked you?”
Eddie leaned closer, his eyes tracing the grotesque silhouette in the photograph. He remembered the thing in the courtyard—the way it moved on all fours, the unnatural length of its limbs, the face that wasn't right. He compared that memory to the tragic figure in the photo. They were both wrong, both twisted mockeries of life. But they weren't the same.
He took a slow, shaky breath, the chilling realization dawning on him.
“Yeah…” he said, his voice low and full of a new kind of dread. “It’s pretty close.”
The weight of his words hung in the frigid air between them. Not just one monster. An entirely different one. The implications settled, cold and sharp.
Madeleine snapped the journal shut, the sound echoing in the silent corridor. The strength that had held her upright seemed to drain away all at once. She took a half-stumbling step back, her hand finding the wall for support before she sank onto a simple wooden bench not far from the enclosure, her shoulders slumping.
She buried her face in her hands for a moment, her breath trembling. When she looked up, her eyes were wide with a retroactive terror.
“Thank goodness you’re alive, Edward…” she said, her voice shaking. She glanced back at the scarred walls of the empty cell. “That thing… the Spike Man… the sounds it made, the way it threw itself against the walls… If what you fought was anything like that…” She trailed off, unable to finish the thought, “You’re really lucky.”
Eddie looked from the horrifying enclosure to Madeleine’s shaken form. The fear was a cold knot in his own stomach, but seeing hers fanned the embers of his anger into a steady flame.
“That’s why we have to do something about it,” he said, his voice firm. He took a step closer to the bench. “Madeleine, there are two of them that we know of. God knows how many more are out there. We can’t just wait for another one to show up.”
“But what can we do?” she countered, her voice laced with weary defeat. “I’ve been trying to find answers since this specimen arrived. I’ve spent months in the archives, cross-referencing restricted texts, running every alchemical trace I could think of. All it gave me was more questions. No history, no known point of origin… It’s a dead end, Eddie.”
He listened, his gaze fixed on the empty cell. A dead end. Maybe for a scientist.
“You’re looking at it from the wrong angle,” he said quietly.
She looked up, frowning. “What do you mean?”
“You’re treating it like a puzzle,” he explained, turning to face her fully. “Something to be identified and classified. Something to be studied. You are asking what created them. But this isn't a natural phenomenon, Madeleine. This is a crime.” He gestured toward the claw marks. “The question you should be asking is who created them.”
Madeleine went silent, her expression shifting from tired frustration to startled focus. The idea hung in the air, simple and yet paradigm-shifting. All her research, all her expertise, was focused on the creature. She had never truly focused on the creator.
She stared at him for a long moment, a new, dangerous light dawning in her eyes.
“Are you suggesting,” she said slowly, her voice regaining its strength, “You’re going to search for the creator of this… thing?”
For a long moment, Eddie didn’t answer. The sheer audacity of it seemed to settle on him, pushing him down. His gaze dropped from Madeleine’s face to the scratched-up floor of the empty enclosure, then to the worn handle of his crutch. 
He was just a student. A first-year with one strike away from expulsion. Will’s angry warning echoed in his mind, a stark reminder of how much he stood to lose. Every rational thought told him to walk away, to mind his own business, to forget he’d ever seen the things that stalked the campus after dark. Doubt clouded his features, making him look younger, more vulnerable.
He met Madeleine’s waiting gaze. The doubt in his own eyes hardened, replaced by a cold, clear certainty. His grip tightened on his crutch, not for support, but like he was holding a weapon.
“Yeah.” Eddie said, “I will.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 31 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by her son's room's oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 
A flicker of unease settled in her chest. Frowning, she turned the handle and pushed the door open.
The scent of the sea breeze drifted in, mingling with the familiar aroma of parchment and faint traces of potion ingredients. But something was... wrong.
Her eyes swept across the room, and for a moment, she didn’t register it. Then, it struck her all at once.
The bed—perfectly made. Not a single blanket thrown askew, no haphazard pile of pillows. The sheets were pulled tight, smooth as if untouched.
The desk—once a chaotic sprawl of open books, ink-stained papers, and forgotten potion vials—was orderly. Neat stacks replaced the usual clutter. The old alchemical texts, once left to gather dust, had been carefully arranged.
At the corner of the desk sat Eddie’s handmade radio. Its brass dials gleaming faintly in the morning light. The small headset, draped neatly over the side, emitted a soft, crackling hum. 
“…and over in Edenfield, clear skies and a bright, sunny day ahead…”
Her eyes moved to the window. It was open, letting the golden morning light pour in, warmly bathing the room. The soft murmur of the sea drifted in, accompanied by the cry of gulls. 
Eddie was gone, but not in the way he used to disappear into himself. This time, something had changed.
A soft smile tugged at the corners of her lips. Her heart swelled with quiet joy as she realised what had happened. Eddie had finally woken up—not just from sleep, but from the fog of despair that had weighed him down for seven years. He had tidied his room, made his bed, and left purposefully. The message, crystal clear, was silent. He was ready to move forward and re-engage with the world outside.
She stood there for a few moments longer, taking it in, feeling pride swell in her chest. Eddie, her boy, was finding his way again.
On the wall of his room, there is a new calendar, this one is clean, with no mark.
There is a circle on it.
5th of January, 1928.
It was today.
With a soft sigh of contentment. She shut the door behind her, allowing the room to be quiet. She turned and made her way downstairs, a little lighter on her feet, a little more at peace, knowing her son was beginning a new chapter.
She had a day to get on with—the apothecary to tend to, potions to brew, customers to assist—but everything seemed just a little brighter now. Eddie had woken up from his long slumber, and that was all she needed to know. 

-o-

Eddie stepped off the, flipping a few coins to the ferryman before pedalling his bicycle. 
The air here was different—crisper, drier. It lacked Weshaven’s thick briny scent, but in its place was something just as rich: the warm spice of freshly unloaded crates, the earthy tang of dried herbs, and the faint, papery whiff of parchment and ink as merchants tallied their stock.
Osthaven thrived with a different kind of energy. Where Weshaven had the steady, unhurried rhythm of fishermen gutting their morning’s catch, this place pulsed with movement and purpose. Dockhands hauled crates stamped with foreign sigils, couriers weaved effortlessly between carts, and merchants haggled over silk and spices from distant lands.
For the first time in a long while, Eddie felt something stir in his chest—not quite excitement, but something close. Possibility, maybe. A reminder that beyond everything he had left behind, there were still places to go, things to see, and new paths waiting to be taken.
Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the town humming with life around him. The salty breeze had faded, replaced by the warm aroma of fresh bread, sharp spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach grumbled in protest—breakfast had been rushed—but he barely noticed.
After scanning the street for the right building, he moved to sling his bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
Across the street, a building stood apart from the rest. Its stone walls bore the weight of age, but the towering columns remained proud, their intricate carvings unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, softened their edges, but their elegance endured—a testament to something greater than the years that had passed.
Above its heavy wooden doors, an emblem gleamed in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, its wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into a worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, a quiet stirring in his chest. He had never noticed it before—maybe he had never thought to look. But now, standing there, the emblem seemed to be looking back at him. Watching. Weighing.
His eyes traced the contours of the owl, its unblinking gaze steady, unwavering. It wasn’t just a place. It was a challenge. An invitation.
Eddie took a breath, gripping his handlebars a little tighter.
Alright, then. Let’s see what you’ve got.

-o-

The large double doors stood in front of him. Imposing yet inviting in a way only magical institutions could be. He took a deep breath and walked toward them, feeling the weight of the past and the future merge in that single step. The carved owl emblem seemed to watch his every move as if assessing whether he was ready for what lay inside.
This was the place where his life could change again.
Eddie walked through the heavy oak doors of the Sage’s Institute. Feeling a wave of warmth as the air changed from the busy streets of Central Weshaven to the quiet, scholarly atmosphere inside. The scent of old parchment and aged wood hit him immediately. A sense of academic grandeur wrapped in an almost mystical aura. His footsteps echoed across the polished stone floor. Runes, faintly glowing and humming with the wisdom of ages past, etched each tile.
In the centre of the reception hall stood a massive circular desk, staffed by clerks in deep blue robes. The space buzzed with quiet efficiency. The occasional murmur of conversation drifting through the grand chamber. Above the desk, a vast map of Solivia and the surrounding realms were etched into the stone wall. Golden pins mark various magical academies across the land.
Eddie’s gaze lingered, his eyes tracing the intricate pathways connecting cities. He recognised a few of the names.
Silverleaf University, nestled deep in the Forests of Hoverhill. It was reputed to be a haven for those who wished to blend magic with the natural world. Where the trees themselves seemed to hum with arcane energy.
Angelwood University, perched on the serene shores of Dill. Its ivory towers gleamed like pearls against the backdrop of crashing waves. A place where sea mages and weathercasters honed their craft.
Faraday University, on the rolling hills of King’s Grave. Surrounded by windswept fields and ancient stone monoliths. Known for its rigorous studies in enchantment and magical engineering. Solivia considered its graduates the finest spellwrights.
Finally, Eddie’s eyes landed on a pin in the heart of the Plains of Edenfield.
Edenfield University.
Unlike the other names, this one carried a weight that tugged at his chest. It wasn’t just another academy on the map. Edenfield was the dream, the pinnacle of magical education. It wasn’t a place for ordinary students—it was a place for the exceptional, for those destined to leave their mark on the world.
The golden pin glinted under the soft light as if beckoning him. Eddie swallowed hard, his fingers curling into his palms. A flicker of doubt crept into his mind. Did he belong there? Could he ever belong there?
The map whispered promises of possibility. A life beyond Weshaven and the confines of his father’s shop. But it also reminded him of the weight of expectations, of what it would mean to fail.
Eddie’s jaw tightened as he stepped back, shaking off the thoughts. His gaze lingered on the golden pin marking Edenfield University for a moment longer. Before he turned away, the image burned into his mind.
Eddie approached the desk, feeling out of place among the others, waiting. Some were dressed in elegant robes, and others carried enchanted scrolls. All seemed to radiate an air of confidence and purpose that Eddie wasn’t entirely sure he could fake.
One of the clerks, a middle-aged man. Spectacles perched on the edge of his nose and a weary yet meticulous expression. Glanced up from his parchment as Eddie hesitated in front of him.
“Yes?” the clerk prompted, his voice calm and measured. The single syllable was laden with impatience.
“Uh, hi,” Eddie began, forcing himself to sound steady. “I’m here about a scholarship to Edenfield.”
The clerk’s brow creased slightly. “A scholarship to Edenfield?” he repeated, setting down his quill with deliberate slowness. “You mean the Sage’s Institute sponsorship program?”
“That’s the one,“ Eddie said, trying to sound casual, though his hands clenched the edge of the desk.
The clerk’s expression flickered with doubt. He looked Eddie over, taking in the simple, slightly scuffed clothes and lack of discernible magical equipment. “I see. And you are... a registered applicant, I presume?“
“Not... exactly,“ Eddie admitted, heat rising to his cheeks. “But I—”
“Not registered.“ The clerk interrupted smoothly, his lips twitching into a faint, humourless smile. “Young man, the Sage’s Institute sponsorship is one of the most competitive programs in Solivia. Prestigious mentors typically nominated candidates or already have a record of exceptional performance. Forgive me, but you don’t quite seem...“ He gestured vaguely at Eddie, as if to say you don’t belong here. “...like the usual candidate profile.”
Eddie bristled, but swallowed his frustration. “Look, I don’t exactly scream ‘prodigy,‘ but I’m serious about this. I just—“
“Serious,“ the clerk echoed, his tone clipped as if he had heard this line a thousand times before. He picked up his quill again, his eyes drifting back to his parchment. “I’m afraid potential is rarely enough. Perhaps you’d like to review our admissions guidelines? And apply through the standard process—“
“But this isn’t standard,“ Eddie blurted, desperation creeping into his voice. “I have something—someone who’s vouching for me.”
The clerk gave him a sceptical glance over the rim of his spectacles. “Oh? And who might that be?”
Eddie hesitated. This was it. He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out the brass card Catherine had given him. The polished metal gleamed faintly under the reception hall’s magical lighting. He placed it on the desk with more confidence than he felt, sliding it toward the clerk.
“What’s this?“ the clerk asked, eyebrows raised as he reached for the card.
The clerk examined the card, his practised fingers turning it over. His face remained impassive until his eyes landed on the owl sigil of the Sage’s Institute. His brows furrowed slightly, but when his gaze flicked to the name and title engraved below, his demeanour shifted.
“Catherine,“ the clerk murmured, reading aloud. His tone carried an undertone of disbelief. His eyes darted back to the card.
Eddie nodded, unsure whether to feel proud or more intimidated by the weight of the name.
The clerk’s eyes snapped to Eddie, sharp and broad, like he had just seen a ghost. His mouth opened and closed wordlessly for a moment before he managed, “You mean this, Catherine? Is Catherine the Elf?“
Eddie nodded, shifting awkwardly under the man’s intense gaze.
For a heartbeat, the clerk stared at him. His earlier scepticism evaporated like mist under a scorching sun. He looked down at the card again, as if to confirm that it hadn’t somehow changed in the last few seconds. Then, straightening, he cleared his throat, visibly trying to compose himself.
“Well,“ the clerk said, his tone noticeably different now—more measured, almost reverent. “This is... highly unusual. Catherine the Elf does not give her endorsements lightly.”
He studied Eddie with a new, cautious intensity. Like a man reevaluating a puzzle he had underestimated. “Are you saying she’s vouching for you? Personally?”
Eddie nodded again, this time firmer, though the clerk’s disbelief lingered.
The man took a deep breath, his fingers tightening on the edge of the card. “Very well,“ he said at last, setting it down carefully as though it were made of glass. “Let me see what arrangements can be made.“
“Wait here for a moment,“ the clerk said, his voice now more measured. He disappeared through a doorway behind the desk. Leaving Eddie standing alone in the middle of the vast reception hall with his thoughts.
Eddie’s mind raced. He had no idea what Catherine’s influence truly meant in a place like this, and for a moment, he felt the weight of it all. This was a pivotal moment. If the card didn’t work, this whole attempt could fall apart. His gaze wandered around the room, taking in the portraits of past scholars watching him from the walls, their eyes following his every move. They were judging him, questioning whether he could walk the same halls they had.
Time seemed to stretch on as Eddie waited, the quiet hum of the Institute suddenly louder in the silence of his thoughts. His heart beat a little faster. He was on the precipice of something—he could feel it.
The door opened again, and the clerk returned, his expression now softened with respect. “Mr. Welton, if you would follow me, someone will speak with you shortly.”
Eddie nodded, tucking the card back into his pocket. He felt its slight weight as he followed the clerk deeper into the halls of the Sage’s Institute.
A girl in a deep blue robe approached him as Eddie stood there, waiting by the front desk. Her robe bore the emblem of the Sage’s Institute—a stylized owl perched on a scroll, its wings elegantly outstretched. She looked at Eddie with calm, appraising eyes before offering a slight nod.
“Edward Welton?“ she asked.
Eddie nodded.
“Come with me,“ she said, her voice steady but kind. “I’m Emma Somers. I’m the agent responsible for the Edenfield Scholars program.”
Eddie stepped beside her, feeling a mixture of nerves and anticipation. They walked silently for a moment before Emma led him to a spiralling staircase at the far side of the hall. As they began their ascent, Eddie glanced around. Taking in the intricate carvings on the bannisters—symbols of magic from all the schools he had once dreamed of mastering. The stairs spiralled upwards, the balustrade intricately carved with symbols of various schools of magic—Conjuration, Destruction, Alchemy, and more. Soft light from floating orbs illuminated their way, casting long shadows on the walls.
The stairs seemed to wind endlessly upward, and the air grew quieter as they ascended, the sounds of the busy reception hall fading into a soft hum below.
“First time going to the Sage’s Institute?“ Emma asked.
“Yeah, the place is huge for a magic academy,” Eddie said
“Indeed it is,“ Emma answered, “the Sage’s Institute is more than just a magical academy. Its roots go back centuries, to the time of the Nine Sages.“
Eddie’s eyes drifted to the portraits lining the walls as they ascended the winding staircase. He counted nine figures, each depicted with solemn dignity, their robes flowing like shadows that almost seemed alive. Each face held an ageless quality, their sharp eyes brimming with wisdom and quiet power. The intricate brushstrokes revealed an unmistakable Elven influence in the art.
“The Nine Sages,“ Emma said, noticing his gaze. Her voice was reverent as they climbed, “Were a band of scholars centuries ago. This was before the unification of magical academies. Back when magic was feared as much as it was revered. Their mission was to spread the knowledge of magic. Their mission was to guide, teach, and prevent the hoarding and misuse of magic, as had occurred during the Great Mages’ War.
Eddie slowed his steps, his eyes lingering on each portrait. “So... who were they, exactly?“ he asked, genuinely curious.
Emma smiled faintly, glancing back at him. “Each of them was a master in their own field, a visionary who shaped what magic is today. Caerwyn Eithrel—The Founder—is perhaps the most famous. He’s the one who envisioned a world where magic could be a bridge between peoples rather than a weapon. He authored the Codex Magicka, the very foundation of magical education. That’s him there,“ she added, gesturing to a tall, ethereal figure, his silver hair cascading like moonlight.
Eddie’s gaze shifted to the next portrait. A graceful figure with auburn hair crowned with woven herbs. “And her?“
“That’s Merrion Aelwyd—The Healer,“ Emma explained. “She travelled far and wide, healing the sick and teaching the arts of alchemical medicine. Her contributions to healing magic are unmatched even today. Her staff,“ she pointed to the depiction of the figure’s wooden staff. Sprouting with living vines “Is said to have grown from a sapling she saved during a storm.”
Emma motioned to the third figure, draped in a feathered cloak. Their hand rested on a staff intricately carved with what looked like constellations. “Talinor Rhydderch—The Explorer. They charted magical ley lines and discovered lost traditions. Thanks to them, we have portals and magical maps to navigate the arcane realm.”
With each Sage, Eddie found himself increasingly drawn to the stories, his curiosity mounting.
Emma continued to the next portrait row, “These three are the Mortal Men. Brython Gwalchmai—The Artist—used his art to make magic approachable. Inspiring countless people through performances and festivals. Edris Taranis—The Peacemaker—dedicated his life to uniting magical factions. And Loegrin Myrddin—The Philosopher. Penned the Ethics of Magic, which every Edenfield student must study.“
Eddie’s eyes settled on the last three figures, whose stout forms and powerful gazes set them apart.
“And these must be the Dwarves,“ he said.
“Exactly,“ Emma replied, nodding. “That’s Gerwald Eisenfaust—The Warrior—who balanced magic and martial skill to protect the weak. Sigmar Tiefenruh—The Protector—created the first magical vaults to safeguard dangerous artefacts. And Hildebrand Steindottir—The Innovator. Pushed the boundaries of enchantments, crafting the first magical prosthetics and automaton workers.”
Eddie stared at Hildebrand’s portrait, noticing the tools and gadgets painted with remarkable detail. He could almost feel the hum of innovation radiating from the canvas.
“The Nine Sages aren’t just history,“ Emma said softly, breaking his reverie. “They’re why places like Edenfield exist. Their ideals live on in studying, teaching, and using magic. They remind us that magic is a responsibility, not just a power.”
Eddie nodded, the weight of their legacy settling on him as they reached the top of the staircase. The winding steps had felt endless, but now they seemed to represent something else entirely. A journey not just of discovery, but of purpose.
“The Sage’s Institute was founded to carry on that mission,“ Emma said, glancing at Eddie as she spoke. “Our Scholarship program to places like Edenfield exists to ensure that the vision of the Nine Sages continues, even today. We’re not just looking for students with magical talent. We’re looking for those with the potential to carry on that legacy. To spread knowledge and contribute to the world of magic.”
Eddie took it all in, feeling the weight of the surrounding history. They passed under a large painting of the sages standing together before the High King. He felt renewed awe for the institution he was now a part of, even if he was still uncertain about his place there.
“You’ll see portraits of the sages throughout the Institute,“ Emma said. Gesturing to the figures on the wall. “They were instrumental in creating the very first magical universities. Edenfield was one of the first. Many magical traditions and practices we follow today derive from their teachings.“
They continued upward, the steps seeming endless. The further they went, the quieter the building became. The sounds of the bustling reception hall below faded into a deep, almost reverent silence.
Emma finally glanced over her shoulder at Eddie. “You’re lucky, you know,“ she said, her tone softening slightly. “Not everyone gets a recommendation like the one you have. Master Alchemist Catherine’s name holds a lot of weight here.”
Eddie didn’t quite know how to respond to that. He just nodded, gripping the card Catherine had given him tighter in his pocket.
As they entered the room labelled “Edenfield Office,“ Eddie felt a mix of anticipation and anxiety. Books and scrolls filled the shelves, and the scent of old parchment and ink hung heavy in the air. Emma sat behind a sturdy desk while Eddie sat across from her.
“Alright, Mr. Welton,“ Emma began, her tone sharp and professional. “I’ll add you to the list of Scholarship Applicants. But let me make something obvious.“ She fixed him with a steely gaze. “I know you’re connected to Master Alchemist Catherine, but that won’t mean a thing in this process. You’re not getting in just because of a connection. You will earn your place here on your own.”
Eddie swallowed hard, nodding slowly. “I understand.”
Emma continued, her voice unwavering. “You’re going on the entrance exam list. But unlike most applicants who have three months to prepare, you have three weeks. Three weeks to prove that you’re worthy.”
His heart sank. “Three weeks? That’s… really tight.”
Emma’s expression remained cold, “Let’s discuss your path forward. What faculty do you intend to study in at Edenfield?”
Eddie hesitated, the weight of her gaze pressing down on him like a physical force. For a moment, he let his mind wander. Considering the options Emma had laid out earlier: Conjuration, Illusion, Bardry, Enchantments, Automaton Engineering, Alchemy. Each sounded enticing, brimming with possibilities.
Noticing his uncertainty, Emma leaned back in her chair, her tone matter-of-fact. “Let me make this simple for you. Each faculty focuses on a distinct branch of magic. Each has its own strengths and limitations. It’s important to choose something that aligns with both your abilities and interests.”
She began ticking them off on her fingers. “Conjuration is the art of summoning—objects or entities from the Arcane Realm. It’s powerful but dangerous if mishandled. Illusion is about perception and deception, manipulating what others see or believe. Bardry is resonance magic—using performance to amplify and harmonise magical or emotional forces. Enchantment emphasises imbuing objects with magical properties, giving them unique powers or functions.”
Her gaze sharpened. “Automaton Engineering combines mechanical ingenuity with enchantments, creating constructs and magical devices. It’s highly technical but revolutionary.”
Finally, her hand rested on the desk. “And Alchemy,“ she said, her voice steady, “is the science of transformation. It’s about breaking down the physical properties of materials and reassembling them into something entirely new. Alchemy requires precision, knowledge, and resourcefulness. Done correctly, it’s incredibly versatile. Done poorly—“ she gave a slight, almost imperceptible shrug, “—it’s unforgiving.”
Eddie felt the weight of each choice pressing down on him. But as Emma’s voice faded, his thoughts drifted again—
He thought of Davies’s words. Catherine’s advice came to mind, too, her calm, encouraging voice urging him to trust in what he was good at. And then there were the hours spent at the apothecary. Every tincture he brewed and every substance he transformed reminded him of what he loved most about magic: the ability to change, adapt, and refine.
“I’ll go with Alchemy,“ he said, his voice resolute.
Emma’s expression remained inscrutable as she studied him. “Alchemy?“ she repeated, her tone carrying a hint of challenge. “Do you understand what you’re committing to? It’s difficult, and your past will follow you here.“
“I know,“ Eddie replied, his voice steady but firm. He met her gaze directly, feeling the weight of his decision settle like a constant flame in his chest.
“Now, let’s cover the topics that will be on the Edenfield’s Faculty of Alchemy entrance exam.” Leaning forward, her demeanour shifted to a more informative one. “You’ll need to demonstrate your understanding of basic alchemical principles, including transmutation and the properties of common materials. There will also be a practical component where you’ll perform a simple alchemical process.“
Eddie’s heart raced as he took it all in. “What kind of process?“
“Something straightforward,” Emma replied coolly.
“Sounds simple enough,“ Eddie said, trying to mask his apprehension.
Emma continued, her tone returning to its earlier sharpness. “I expect you to come prepared. Alchemy is a demanding discipline, and if you want to succeed, you’ll need to prove you can handle it.”
o-
The tram creaked steadily through the inky darkness of the night. Its rhythmic clattering echoed in the silence that enveloped the world outside. Inside one of the dimly lit wagons, Eddie sat alone. The flickering glow of overhead lights framed his silhouette. He leaned against the cool metal window, staring at the blur of shadows.
The tram rumbled along the tracks. Eddie stared out the window, watching the landscape of Central Weshaven. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels provided a comforting backdrop to his swirling thoughts. He could hear the distant hum of murmurs from other passengers. But they felt miles away, as if he were encased in a bubble of stillness. The comforting thrum of the train’s engine contrasted with the sombre weight pressing down on his chest. This ache had settled there long before this journey began.
How am I going to re-learn Alchemy in three weeks? The weight of Emma’s expectations loomed over him like a dark cloud. The idea of preparing for the entrance exam felt daunting, especially after years of stepping away from magic.
He recalled the lessons from his childhood—Catherine’s patient guidance, the endless experiments in her workshop, the intoxicating scent of alchemical ingredients filling the air. But now, those memories felt distant, almost like a forgotten dream. Could he really reclaim that knowledge in such a short time?
Eddie took a deep breath, his mind racing. He would need to gather his old textbooks, dust off his notes, and practice the fundamentals. But where would he even begin? The thought of diving back into a world he had distanced himself from sent a shiver down his spine.
A sudden jolt of the tram snapped him back to reality. He glanced around at the other passengers, each absorbed in their own worlds. Eddie’s heart pounded as he wondered if they had ever faced a challenge as monumental as his.
Outside, the landscape darkened further, swallowed by the night, and Eddie felt a chill creep into the wagon. He wrapped his arms around his knees, a fragile shield against the creeping thought. The world beyond the window was a canvas of obscurity. Yet, within it, he felt the weight of every unspoken word and every missed connection. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 35 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie puts his hands on his pocket. His jacket provides warmth, although very little, grounding him. Around him, the dock bustled with quiet energy. Dockhands shouted to one another as they secured the ship. Travellers called out farewells to loved ones, and crates thudded against wood as loaded into the cargo hold. 
It had been a month since the letter arrived. Four weeks of disbelief gave way to frantic preparation. The moment he’d torn open the envelope and read those words of acceptance, his life had shifted course. Edenfield. The dream he never dared believe had now shaped into a real, tangible future.
The days since had passed in a whirlwind of small, purposeful actions. Eddie spent his mornings helping at the apothecary. Grinding herbs, mixing tinctures, and packing powders, the clink of glass bottles was a constant soundtrack. Every coin he earned went straight into supplies. Notebooks bound in sturdy leather, glass vials neatly padded in cloth, pencils, and a second-hand satchel that looked worn but sturdy enough to last.
His evenings were spent poring over Emma’s letter. Which he had read so many times that the folds were beginning to fray. “You have been assigned a place in the Sage’s Institute dormitory. A modest allowance will be provided to support you as you settle.” Modest was right—it wasn’t much, but Eddie wasn’t about to complain. It would cover food, at least for a while, and that was more than enough. He had spent hours calculating how far he could stretch the funds. He made lists and crossed them out as he reprioritised them.
His world had narrowed into sharp focus for the first time: prepare, save, plan. The quiet, routine rhythms of Weshaven had taken on a sense of urgency. Eddie hadn’t allowed himself a moment to think too deeply about what lay ahead. There was too much to do, too little time to waste.
But now the time was up.
Now, standing on the old wooden docks of Weshaven. That month of frenzied preparation felt like it had vanished in an instant. The morning was still and quiet, as though the world was holding its breath. A light mist hung thick in the air, softening the edges of everything. Blurring the familiar shapes of the docks. The distant steamships and the endless sea stretching out into the unknown. Eddie shifted the strap of his satchel over his shoulder. The weight of the bag grounded him—he’d crammed everything he would need to start his life at Edenfield into that one bag.
As Eddie reached the bustling harbor, the salty sea breeze ruffled Eddie’s hair while he approached the ticket booth, ticket in hand. Behind him loomed a magnificent ship destined for Edenfield, its sails billowing in the wind like a giant, proud creature. Eddie gazed up in awe, knowing himself will aboard such a vessel, a prospect that seemed closer than ever as he passed his entrance exam.
The ship’s horn echoed across the misty harbor, a low, resounding call that sent a shiver through the wooden planks beneath their feet. The cold morning air was thick with salt and silence as Eddie turned to face each of his family member, her usual grin softened by something more tender.
The faint scent of the sea mingled with the damp wood and iron, seeping into his thoughts and bringing a pang to his chest. He’d grown up with these smells. The gentle lapping of the tide against the docks, the sharp cry of gulls overhead—the lullaby of home, the rhythm of a life that felt so steady before everything began to change.
Eddie took a slow breath, filling his lungs as though trying to memorise everything. Weshaven had been his whole world for as long as he could remember. It was strange to think that it would be behind him by the end of the day. He’d be on his way to Edenfield—Edenfield, he thought again. As though testing the word on his tongue—to begin whatever awaited him there.
Eddie gripped the strap of his satchel a little tighter. The rough canvas bit into his palm, grounding him. Around him, the dock bustled with quiet energy. Dockhands shouted to one another as they secured the ship. Travellers called out farewells to loved ones, and crates thudded against wood as loaded into the cargo hold.
This was it.
He took a steadying breath. A sharp tang of salt air filled his lungs as he stepped closer to the gangway. It stretched upward like a bridge into the unknown. A narrow passage into a future he could barely picture. The ship groaned against its moorings as if impatient to set sail. Eddie’s heart thudded in his chest, each beat louder than the last, matching the rhythmic hiss of steam from the ship’s engine.
He glanced back for just a moment. His family was close by—his mother and father, standing a little apart but close enough to feel at home. Torrie was walking beside him, her face slightly hidden in the folds of her hood. And her footsteps were too light, too quiet for him to hear unless he focused. Markus and Lydia were beside them, quiet too, though he could feel their presence, their shared weight of the moment, as if this was a silent pact between them all.
He’d wanted to go to Edenfield for so long. The city with its history, the ancient university, the promise of magic and mystery. All those things called to him like a flame, lighting the path forward. He wanted to prove himself. He wanted to show everyone, including himself, that he was worthy of the life he was about to enter. But here, in the heavy mist, with the sea mist curling around the edges of the platform and his family walking alongside him, he felt the pull of home more than ever.
And yet, as much as his heart tugged toward the small coastal town, his mind pulled him toward the unknown. Deep down, he knew there was more out there for him. More than what Weshaven could offer, more than the life he’d lived so far. But leaving it behind was a difficult thing to face.
For a moment, he hesitated. His gaze drifted back across the harbour to the clustered rooftops of Weshaven. Mist still softened their edges. This was the town he’d known all his life, the familiar rhythm of the sea and the streets a constant comfort. Now, it seemed distant, as though he were already halfway gone.
Standing next to him, Torrie gripped his arm, her fingers digging into his sleeve. Eddie glanced down at his little sister. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears, though she was trying so hard to be brave. Her lip trembled as she looked up at him.
“I’ll miss you, Eddie,” Torrie whispered, her voice small and soft.
Eddie crouched down so they were at eye level and gave her a reassuring smile. Gently, he brushed a stray lock of her hair behind her ear, just like he used to when she was younger. “I’ll miss you too, Torrie. More than you know.” He paused, his expression turning serious but warm. “But you’re strong, you know that? You’re smart, too—smarter than I ever was at your age. Keep practising that unlocking spell, yeah?”
Torrie let out a half-hearted laugh, though her lower lip wobbled slightly.
Eddie rested a hand on her shoulder, steady and firm. “I need you to look after Mom and Dad while I’m gone, okay? Especially Dad. He’s been working harder lately, and he is not as young as he used to be. You can help him—he’ll appreciate it, even if he doesn’t say it.”
Her face scrunched up in that stubborn way Eddie knew so well. “I will,” she muttered, nodding fiercely. “I’ll help. And you better write.”
“I will,“ Eddie said, ruffling her hair gently, a spark of pride warming his chest at her determination. “I’ll write as soon as I settle in. You’ll hardly have time to miss me, I promise.”
Torrie squeezed his arm again. Clinging to a little longer this time before stepping back. Her forced smile wavered, but she stood tall, trying her best to be brave. Eddie watched her, his little sister, who suddenly seemed so much older, and he knew then that leaving her behind might be the hardest part.
His mother was next. She moved toward him, her face a mixture of pride and sorrow. With a gentle but firm hand, she placed it on his shoulder. Eddie could feel the slight tremor in her fingers, the way she fought to hold back the tears.
“I’m so proud of you, Eddie,“ she said, her voice thick with emotion. “You’ve worked so hard for this. Don’t forget who you are, and remember, we’re always here. No matter what.”
Eddie nodded, feeling the lump in his throat grow. He leaned in to hug her, the warmth of her embrace grounding him at the moment. “I won’t forget. I love you, Mom.”
His father, ever stoic, surprised Eddie by stepping forward. Pulling him into a brief, strong hug. His arms were firm, his grip solid—like he was silently passing on some of his strength. When they pulled apart, Eddie noticed his father’s familiar, steady gaze soften slightly, the corners of his mouth twitching as if holding back a smile.
“Well, I guess this is it,“ Mr Welton said, his voice low but warm.
Eddie hesitated for a moment before breaking into a grin. “Hey, Dad... I’m still sorry about breaking your flintlock rifle,“ he said, scratching the back of his neck. “I know you really loved that rifle.”
Mr Welton blinked at him for a second, and Eddie braced himself for a scolding. Then his father chuckled—a deep, genuine laugh that Eddie hadn’t heard.
“You mean that old thing?“ Mr Welton said, his voice light with amusement. “Honestly, you’ve done me a huge favour! It was meant to give your mother an excuse to let me buy one of those newer models from the gunsmith. I’ll tell her it was all your fault, of course.”
They both laughed. And at that moment, it felt like the weight of Eddie’s departure was softened by their shared humour.
As the laughter faded, Mr Welton’s expression turned fond though wistful. “I’ll miss you, Edward. Your leaving reminds me of when your brother Alfred packed his things and headed off to join the army. Now it’ll just be me, your mother, and Torrie rattling around this house. It’s going to be too quiet without you boys.”
His father clapped a firm hand on his shoulder, squeezing it. “Just promise me one thing, Edward. Don’t do anything shady in Edenfield. I know how you university types can get.“
“Me? Shady?“ Eddie said with mock indignation, a grin breaking through. “Don’t worry, Dad. I’m the picture of innocence!”
Mr. Welton laughed, “Don’t bullshit me, son!.”
They stood there momentarily, the comfortable silence between them saying more than words ever could. Eddie felt a surge of warmth and gratitude. That his father’s parting gift wasn’t a trinket but a piece of himself, wrapped in humour and strength.
Markus and Lydia were waiting nearby. Markus, the ever-optimistic friend, tried to mask his sadness with a grin. He clapped Eddie on the back, its force making Eddie stumble.
“Hey, don’t let them turn you into one of those snooty academics up there in Edenfield,“ Markus joked, trying to lighten the mood. “You know, the ones who always wear those ridiculous robes and talk about magic like it’s a science project.“
Eddie snorted, appreciating the effort. “I’ll try to avoid becoming one of them. But no promises.”
The four of them shared a long, wordless look. A moment of understanding passed between them, its weight lingering in the air. Things would change. There was no avoiding it. The goodbye hung in the air like a bittersweet song, something neither of them was ready to hear but something they couldn’t prevent.
“Boarding now!“ a voice called sharply, jolting Eddie from his partings. He turned, blinked, and nodded faintly to no one in particular with a final glance back at the fading outline of Weshaven. He tightened his grip on his satchel, straightened his shoulders, and took his first step onto the gangway.
The steamship loomed closer with every step, the hiss of its engine growing louder, drowning out everything else. The unknown waited just beyond its deck, vast and uncharted, and for the first time, Eddie didn’t look back.
Eddie’s heart ached as the steamship loomed ahead, the reality of the moment settling in. But as he glanced back at his family and friends, he knew they’d be with him, in some way, every step of the way.
The steamship towered over the docks, its sleek hull gleaming in the sunlight. The striking combination of black and white gleamed under the morning sky. Meanwhile, polished wood accents along the upper decks offered a touch of elegance. Two tall chimneys rose from the centre of the ship. Their red-and-white stripes give it a bold, commanding presence. The rhythmic hiss of the engine and the occasional whistle of venting steam were audible even from a distance, calling Eddie forward.
He stepped closer. The familiar scent of salt and brine mingled in the air. The same as it had been that day Catherine had taken him to the docks. A wave of memory hit him. He could almost hear her voice, clear as day: “If you pass your entrance test, you’ll board this same ship toward Edenfield. Our paths might cross again.“ The words had seemed so distant, so uncertain. Yet here he is. Boarding the same ship, bound for the same destination.
Edenfield.
The distant sound of other steamships, the creaks of the docks underfoot. The rough, weathered houses perched along the cliffs. All these sights and sounds of Weshaven felt as they always had, solid and familiar. But now, with his foot on the gangplank, everything felt different. The sea, the salt in the air, even the sound of the gulls—it was all the same, yet it felt like the last ties to home were slowly slipping away.
The ship’s vast presence is now more than just a passing memory. It seemed to echo Catherine’s words in his mind: Our paths might cross again. It was a fleeting thought that tugged at him, but he couldn’t linger.
He had been so ready to leave, to seek something more significant than his sleepy town. But now, with the steamship before him, a bottomless emptiness settled in his chest. Weshaven wasn’t just a place; it was home. And for the first time, he felt the weight of that truth.
The horizon stretched beyond it, just as it always had, but it seemed farther this time. As though the edge of the world was really there, waiting for him to step past it.
He turned, feeling the steady hum of the steamship’s engines vibrating through the dock. The powerful hiss of the steam venting in the distance added to the moment’s weight. His family and friends were still there, a steady presence in the mist, but even now, the distance between them felt more expansive than ever.
His mother stood close, holding Torrie’s hand, her eyes bright with unshed tears. Torrie waved, her little arm trembling as she tried to smile through the sadness. Markus stood beside Lydia, hands stuffed deep in his pockets, trying to keep a brave face. Though Eddie could see the sorrow hiding beneath his friend’s tough exterior.
Eddie’s heart ached for a moment, wanting to run back to them, hold them, and tell them all that everything would be okay. But he knew he couldn’t. Not yet.
With a final, slow breath, Eddie stepped onto the steamship. Gangplank creaked beneath his feet as the crew moved around him. The sound of the engines grew louder, the hiss of steam signalling the ship’s departure.
He made his way down the narrow corridor, the hum of the ship’s movement vibrating beneath his feet. His gaze stayed fixed on the window near the deck. He could still see his family standing at the edge of the docks, their figures growing smaller and smaller. The mist seemed to close around them like a curtain falling until they were no more than silhouettes, faint outlines against the endless grey sea.
The steamship began to pull away from the harbour. Eddie felt a lump form in his throat, the weight of the goodbye pressing down on him. His hometown, which had shaped him, was slowly slipping from view. The ship gathered speed, and Weshaven, with its familiar sights and sounds, faded into the distance, leaving only memories in its wake.
But those memories stayed with him. Days spent exploring the docks with Markus, late-night talks with Lydia by the storefront, and the quiet rhythm of the town. They were pieces of his past now, treasures that clashed with the uncertainty of what lay ahead. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 12E</Title>
            <Text>The sterile white corridor became a place of silent miracles. From the shimmering, heat-haze curtain of Ashley’s Mirror Veil, ghosts began to emerge. A gaunt, elderly Bapak with haunted eyes stepped out of what looked like thin air, his gaze wide with disbelief. Then a young woman, clutching the arm of her brother, both stumbling on weak legs. Will, a tense shadow by the main lab entrance, would watch the corridor, his face a mask of concentration, before giving a quick, low wave of his hand—Go, now. The freed captives would then move, a silent, ghost-like procession, down the hall leading back to the cacophonous menagerie, their escape masked by the screeching of the captive creatures. Will was the conductor of this impossible orchestra, and Ashley, standing firm with her staff planted, was the magic holding the stage together.
The perspective shifts back to Eddie, who is now on the last three captives, his hope surging.
Inside the holding pen, a powerful, hopeful rhythm had taken hold. The oppressive stench of fear was still there, but now it was mingled with the electric, ozone scent of imminent freedom. Eddie moved to the next cage, his exhaustion forgotten, replaced by a surging, brilliant hope that warmed him from the inside out. We're doing it, he thought, a sense of profound awe washing over him. We're actually doing it.
He no longer needed to look at Madeleine. They were a single unit, moving with an unspoken understanding. As he placed his hand on the next lock, he could hear her soft, steady whisper to the person in the final cage, her voice a balm of reassurance.
The green light of his alchemy felt less like a weapon now and more like a key. Hiss. The lock dissolved into fine grey dust. The cage door creaked open. Madeleine was there instantly, helping a young man to his feet.
&quot;You're okay,&quot; she murmured, giving his arm a firm, steadying squeeze. &quot;Go to my friend at the end of the hall. He'll show you the way. Be quiet, and don't look back.&quot;
The young man looked from Madeleine's tired but fiercely compassionate face to Eddie's, his own eyes filling with tears of disbelief and gratitude. He nodded and shuffled out into the shimmering veil.
Two left.
The holding pen, once a gallery of despair, was now a hall of echoing emptiness. The vast space felt liberating. Eddie allowed himself a small, genuine smile, catching Madeleine's eye as he turned. She returned it, a fleeting, exhausted, but triumphant expression that spoke volumes. They were winning.
He moved to the second-to-last cage. The woman inside was already on her feet, her hands pressed together as if in prayer. The alchemy flowed from him effortlessly now, energized by their success. The final lock dissolved.
One more.
Victory was a breath away. He turned to the last cage, the sense of triumph so close, so tangible, he could almost taste it. One more person to free, and they would have pulled off the impossible.
&quot;Hey! What's the meaning of this!&quot;
The voice was a thunderclap in the sterile quiet. It echoed from the main laboratory corridor, sharp and authoritative. Eddie's smile vanished, his blood running cold. Hope shattered into a million pieces.
He spun around. Professor Gareth Hudson stood at the far end of the room, his face a mask of thunderous disbelief. His polished staff was held tight in one hand, its tip glowing with a faint, dangerous light. Beside him, his two fatigue-jacketed companions snapped into formation, raising military-grade magical staves and aiming them down the hall. Will and Ashley were nowhere to be seen, likely having ducked for cover the moment Hudson appeared.
Without a second thought, Eddie stepped in front of Madeleine, shielding her. &quot;Back off!&quot; he yelled, his voice raw with defiance. He threw his hand forward, and a complex, brilliant green transmutation circle flared to life in the air between them, aimed directly at his professor.
Hudson's companions reacted instantly, their staves shifting to aim squarely at Eddie's chest.
But Hudson himself just stared, his expression looking more confused than angry. &quot;Welton? What in God's name are you doing here? Are you completely mad?&quot;
&quot;I know what you're doing!&quot; Eddie shot back, his voice ringing with righteous fury. &quot;This illegal Chimaera breeding! This whole sick experiment! It ends tonight!&quot;
The accusation struck Hudson like a physical blow. His confusion instantly hardened into a rare, palpable anger. &quot;Chimaeras?&quot; he snarled, taking a threatening step forward. &quot;Do you have any idea of the danger you are in? Of what you have stumbled into? You could have been killed!&quot;
Eddie let out a bitter, incredulous laugh. &quot;Oh, suddenly you care if someone dies? After all the people you've experimented on? After everything you've done to Madeleine?&quot; He gestured wildly at the room around them. &quot;How many have you killed for your precious research?!&quot;
He gathered his energy, the transmutation circle spinning faster, brighter, ready to unleash a wave of corrosive force. But before he could, a hand grabbed his arm. It was Madeleine. Her grip was weak, but astonishingly firm.
&quot;Eddie, stop!&quot;
&quot;Maddie, get back!&quot; he yelled, trying to shake her off, his eyes never leaving Hudson. &quot;I can handle him!&quot;
&quot;No! Eddie, listen to me!&quot; she insisted, pulling on his arm with all her strength. She stumbled in front of him, breaking his line of sight. She put her hands on his chest, forcing him to look down at her, the person he had just risked everything to save. Her eyes were wide, not with fear of Hudson, but with a desperate, pleading urgency. &quot;Please, you have to listen. You've got it wrong.&quot;
&quot;What are you talking about? He's right there!&quot; Eddie fought back, his rage blinding him.
&quot;It wasn't Professor Hudson,&quot; Madeleine said, her voice quiet, but it cut through his fury like a blade of ice. The words hung in the sterile air, heavy and absolute.
The words slammed into Eddie with the force of a physical blow. The brilliant green transmutation circle flickered, sputtered, and died. His arm lowered, feeling impossibly heavy. The entire foundation of his righteous fury, the certainty that had fueled him through the alleys of Hallowmere, crumbled into dust. He stared at Professor Hudson, whose face was no longer just angry, but etched with a deep, familiar weariness—the same grief Eddie had seen the night he'd spoken of his lost daughter. He didn't understand the full story, not even close. But he saw the truth in Madeleine's eyes. And that was enough.
The standoff dissipated, leaving a vacuum of tense, unanswered questions. Hudson’s companions cautiously lowered their staves, their eyes still locked on Eddie.
It was just a moment—a fragile, breathless pause in the heart of the enemy's lair.
Then the world exploded in a flash of violent crimson light.
A streak of spell-fire erupted from the main corridor, silent and impossibly fast. It struck one of Hudson’s companions squarely in the chest. The man cried out, a name—&quot;Jacobs!&quot;—torn from Hudson's throat as the man collapsed, his fatigue jacket smoking.
Instinct, honed by years of training Eddie couldn't possibly comprehend, took over. Hudson didn't hesitate. He lunged, dragging his downed man behind a heavy steel counter. His other companion reacted simultaneously, dropping to one knee and returning fire. A bolt of pure, concussive force erupted from the tip of his staff with a sound like a gunshot, tearing down the hallway toward their unseen assailants.
Eddie shoved Madeleine behind him, instinctively dodging as the firefight erupted. But before he could even raise his own defense, he saw a silhouette in the hall next to him—a different one. He had no time to react. An invisible force, like a solid wall of pressure, slammed into him. He was lifted off his feet and thrown violently across the room. The impact with the hard-tiled wall was a sickening crunch, forcing the air from his lungs before he crumpled to the floor.
His body screamed in protest, a symphony of aches and sharp, stabbing pains. Through a swimming, blurry haze, he pushed himself up onto his elbows.
That's when he saw them.
Figures in long, black cloaks were pouring from the hallway now, moving with a silent, coordinated menace. They flanked the entrance, their faces hidden in shadow. One figure, however, stepped forward, moving with a calm, unhurried grace that was terrifying in its confidence.
As the figure came to a stop in the center of the room, they slowly lowered their hood.
A wave of cold, nauseating horror washed over Eddie, eclipsing the pain. He knew that face. He knew that detached, analytical calm. The friend he had trusted. The man he had defended.
It was Walther Schroder.</Text>

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 4 V2</Title>
            <Text>By the time he reached the apothecary, the comforting scent of herbs and simmering potions greeted him like an old friend. He pushed open the wooden door and stepped into the brewing room, where golden light streamed through the lofty windows, casting long, shifting shadows.
A deep but gentle voice called out from the far end of the room, its warmth filling the space like the heat of a hearth.
&quot;Morning, Edward!&quot;
Markus stood hunched over his workstation, his broad frame making the desk seem almost too small for him. His wild curls peeked out from under his cap, and a faint flush colored his round cheeks—likely from standing over boiling cauldrons all morning. 
He was a large presence in every sense, but his movements were measured, careful, and full of practiced ease as he stirred a simmering mixture, his huge hands treating delicate ingredients with surprising gentleness.
Eddie smirked and reached into his satchel. &quot;Got you something.&quot;
Markus glanced up, his dark eyes curious as Eddie handed over a small paper bag. A familiar scent wafted from within.
&quot;You didn’t,&quot; Markus breathed, opening the bag to reveal golden-brown roasted chestnuts. His expression flickered between delight and nostalgia.
&quot;Stopped by the old stall,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Figured you’d appreciate it.&quot;
&quot;You really do know how to make a guy’s morning.&quot; Markus chuckled, popping one into his mouth and sighing contentedly. &quot;So, how’d it go? With Torrie, I mean.&quot;
&quot;Good. Aella still looks like Aella.&quot; Eddie exhaled, glancing past Markus as if he could still see the academy in the distance. &quot;Nothing much has changed since we were there.&quot;
Markus hummed, a small smile tugging at his lips. &quot;I bet she was buzzing with excitement.&quot;
&quot;Practically skipping through the gates,&quot; Eddie admitted with a chuckle.
Markus laughed, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, that sounds about right.&quot; He rolled up his sleeves, returning his focus to the potion before him. &quot;She’s gonna do great there, you know. Always knew she had it in her.&quot;
Eddie didn’t respond immediately, just nodded, watching the steam rise from Markus’s cauldron.
For a moment, it was like old times.
Eddie had just popped a chestnut into his mouth when Markus spoke, his voice casual but laced with meaning.
“Oh, by the way—Mr. Welton wants to see you earlier.”
Eddie froze mid-chew. A slow, creeping realization dawned on him.
He was supposed to hand over the formula today.
“Damn it—I forgot!” He shot upright,  swallowed hard, nearly choking. nearly knocking over a stack of parchment on the counter.
“Yeah, figured.” Markus raised an amused brow, still munching on his snack. “He’s already up at the tower.”
Cursing under his breath, Eddie spun on his heel and bolted toward the stairs. His boots thudded against the wooden steps as he rushed to his desk, rummaging through scattered notes, ink-stained pages, and unfinished drafts. Where the hell was it?
He shoved aside a worn-out alchemy textbook, and there it was—the carefully scribed formula, buried beneath a pile of old scribbles.
Snatching it up, he didn’t waste another second. He turned on his heel and sprinted towards the tower, heart pounding.

-o-

Eddie barely slowed as he shoved his bedroom door open, the hinges groaning in protest. His pulse pounded in his ears as he bolted down the narrow passageway, the floorboards creaking beneath his hurried steps. 
His arms clutched a haphazard stack of papers and notebooks, some pages slipping loose in his rush.
He was late.
The scent of dried lavender and rosemary clung to the air, undercut by the sharp, metallic tang wafting from the tower above—his father was already deep in his alchemical work.
Markus had warned him, and yet he had still lost track of time.
Eddie skidded to a stop at the base of the spiral staircase, his breath quick and uneven. His gaze flicked to the rune glowing faintly near the stairwell, a familiar aqua shimmer against the stone floor. Alfred’s spellwork. It would cut the thousand-step climb into mere moments.
For a brief second, he hesitated. The rune was convenient. Useful. But magic never quite worked right in his hands, and he didn’t have time for a mishap now.
No choice. He gritted his teeth and lunged up the first step, taking the stairs two at a time.
His boots struck the wood with heavy thuds, the polished steps groaning under his frantic ascent. The wind howled through the narrow side windows, whipping against his cheeks as he climbed higher, the stone walls tightening around him like a winding tunnel. 
His lungs burned, his legs ached, but he didn’t slow.
The tower stretched above him, seemingly endless, but Eddie pushed on, gripping the rail with one hand while keeping his papers pressed against his side with the other.
He was late. He had to move faster.
-o-
Eddie finally reached the top of the tower, his lungs burning and breath hitching in quick, ragged bursts as he crossed the threshold into the alchemist’s lab on top of the tower.
Soft light from the open window cast amusing shadows on the craggy stone walls. He was surrounded by the odours of crushed plants and boiling concoctions and the saline air from big windows with delicate wooden beams. This vantage position revealed the Hamlet of Weshaven, a seaside hamlet full with merchants and fishermen ready for their voyages. 
“Hey there, Eddie!” Mr. Welton said, looking up from his meticulous work with a casual air. 
Mr. Welton looked up from his desk, relaxed. Ageing grey hair neatly brushed back, giving him a quirky genius look. On his nasal bridge, round glasses framed his bright blue eyes that gleamed with warmth and mischief. He looked like someone who had spent his life studying and working, wearing a basic collared shirt with rolled sleeves. Despite his age, his slender frame was nimble. 
Mr. Welton looked up from his desk the moment Eddie burst into the tower, his lips twitching into a smirk.
&quot;Well, well,&quot; he drawled, leaning back in his chair, &quot;Where in the world could my son’s brilliant backache potion formula be? Surely it hasn’t been lost to time and space?&quot;
Eddie let out a breath, half-exasperated, half-relieved, as he rushed to the desk and dropped his bundle of notes and notebooks with a satisfying thud.
&quot;Right here,&quot; Eddie said, smoothing out the topmost page. &quot;And I didn’t lose it—I just… took Torrie to her first day at Aella Academy.&quot;
Mr. Welton, who had been preparing for another playful jab, paused. His teasing smirk softened into something warmer.
&quot;Ah,&quot; he said, nodding as he adjusted his glasses. &quot;Now that is a worthy excuse.&quot;
Eddie ignored the jab, quickly straightening his notes before launching into an explanation. &quot;So, I was thinking—the base potion we use for muscle relief has a long absorption time, right? What if we swap out the oak bark infusion for something more reactive, like willow extract? It has natural pain-relieving properties, and it should cut the absorption time in half.&quot;
Mr. Welton hummed as he followed along, his fingers tapping against the parchment while he skimmed Eddie’s work. His expression, usually lighthearted, turned serious with concentration. He nodded occasionally, making quiet sounds of approval.
After a long moment, he let out a low whistle. &quot;This is brilliant,&quot; he said, setting the page down. &quot;I might actually use this.&quot;
Eddie sat back, his chest swelling with pride. He had expected constructive criticism, maybe even a few amused remarks about overcomplicating things, but praise? That was rare.
Finally, Eddie asked, &quot;So, what’s on the agenda today?&quot;
“Alright, we will need to get these raw materials processed,” Mr. Welton said, slipping on a pair of protective goggles as he approached the array of ingredients strewn across the workbench. “We’ve got to get them ready for brewing in the apothecary. Your mom's a bit understaffed today, and I could really use another set of hands around here.”
Eddie nodded, shaking off his lengthy sleep's fog. He joined his dad and used a wicked-looking knife to slice through the twisted roots. The boiling concoctions, clinking glass devices, and scent of plants and chemicals comforted him as he worked. 
Lab was busy. On another table, glass jars bubbled and steamed, their twisting tubes blazing like ancient monster veins in the faint light. Some bubbled with vibrant hues, while others lay in little glass vials with ethereal light. Eddie saw jars of dried dragon's blood, sparkling scales from mythological fish, and powdered gems on the walls and recalled his childhood ambitions of becoming a famous alchemist, which he had long abandoned.  
 
-o-
As Eddie and Mr. Welton toiled together, the harmonious symphony of slicing and grinding resonated through the lab, mingling with the bubbling and hissing of potions brewing in their cauldrons. The air was thick with the rich scents of crushed herbs, mineral powders, and simmering extracts.
“You know,” Mr. Welton began, his tone casual as he measured out a vibrant powder, “your mother found something this morning.”
Eddie paused mid-chop, glancing up from the herbs he was dicing. “Found something?” He furrowed his brow. “What is it?”
His father didn’t answer right away. Instead, he reached for a folded parchment on the workbench and smoothed it out with deliberate care. The thick, cream-colored paper bore an emblem Eddie didn’t recognize at first—but then, his stomach lurched.
Mr. Welton turned the letter toward him, tapping a finger against the wax seal. “This,” he said, “is no ordinary letter, son. Especially not one that just happens to turn up in a mountain of parchments.”
Eddie swallowed, his throat suddenly dry. The words on the front of the letter gleamed in elegant, embossed script.
Sage’s Institute – Referral for Scholarship Consideration.
Mr. Welton tapped the letter again, his voice steady but firm. “This isn’t just any invitation, Eddie. Look here.”
Eddie leaned in, his eyes following his father’s finger as it traced a line of text near the bottom of the parchment.
Referral valid until the 29th of December, 1927.
His stomach twisted. “That’s barely a month from now,” he murmured.
“Exactly.” Mr. Welton folded his arms, watching Eddie’s reaction carefully. “If you don’t make a decision before then, the opportunity vanishes. You won’t get another chance.”
Eddie exhaled slowly, setting his knife down on the wooden cutting board. “I just… I haven’t really thought about it,” he admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’m not sure I’m cut out for something like that. It’s been tough to think about anything beyond today.”
His father nodded, but there was something searching in his gaze, as if he saw past Eddie’s words. “I know it’s a lot,” he said, his tone gentler. “But this isn’t just about potential—it’s about timing. If you let this slip by, you might regret it down the line.”
“I get it, Dad. But I—”
Mr. Welton set down the vial he had been handling and leaned slightly against the workbench. “Do you remember Aunt Catherine, Edward?”
 “Aunt Catherine?” Eddie blinked, caught off guard. “I… kind of? I mean, I haven’t seen her in decades.”
His father chuckled, shaking his head. “Figures. You were young. But you certainly remember that old alchemy book you’ve practically memorized, don’t you?”
“That was from her?”
“She gave it to you when you were just starting to experiment with transmutations.” Mr. Welton continued, “You spent hours poring over that thing, scrawling notes, testing theories. And back then, you wrote to her constantly, asking questions, exchanging discoveries. She was the one who pushed you to enter that competition.”
Eddie stared down at the referral letter, his mind flickering back to the late nights he’d spent scribbling formulas, the excitement of testing a new method—how much of it had been shaped by that book?
“She practically helped you won those referral, Eddie,” his father continued. “Without her, you might not have even known half the techniques that set you apart. Imagine how she felt if you didn’t consider this.”
Eddie swallowed, suddenly feeling the weight of it all. Catherine had believed in him long before he’d even considered believing in himself.
“It’s been ages since Catherine crossed my mind. So, how’s she holding up?” Eddie asked.
“Your aunt is a real piece of work for sure!” Mr. Welton grinned, a spark of nostalgia dancing in his eyes, “She’s a pretty impressive Alchemist all on her own.”
“Yeah, I remember her being amazing at that,” Eddie said, his mind wandering as he chopped the herbs with a casual flick of his wrist. “But I totally blanked on how much time has passed since we last met.”
Mr. Welton let out a soft chuckle, shaking his head. “That’s because time doesn’t pass for her the way it does for us.” 
“Catherine isn’t just anyone, Eddie.” He picked up the referral letter, his gaze lingering on it. “She’s an Elf. The last remaining ones, that is. For all we know, she’s lived through the rise and fall of kingdoms, seen the Solivian Empire in its prime. She’s a living piece of history.”
Eddie paused mid-slice, glancing up. “Huh.” He hadn’t really thought about it that way. Catherine had always just been… Catherine—brilliant, eccentric, and endlessly knowledgeable. But now that he thought about it, there was something timeless about her, the way she spoke, the way she carried herself, as if she had seen far more than she ever let on.
Mr. Welton smirked. “And yet, despite all that, she still took the time to mentor some scrawny kid with a head full of ambition. Catherine was my Master before she set off on her own epic adventure. She taught me much of what I know today.”
“Hold on, you were her apprentice?” Eddie enquired, arching an eyebrow in curiosity. “You?” The legendary Mr. Welton?”
“Absolutely!” Mr. Welton laughed  “Before I became the legendary Mr. Welton,” his father continued, waving his hand as if brushing away a pesky fly. “I was just a kid, and Catherine was already stirring up quite the storm in the alchemical world. It’s incredible to consider just how gifted she truly is.”
Eddie felt a twist in his gut, a sharp reminder of how much he craved those wild connections and epic adventures. “I totally need to get in touch with her, write a letter or something.”
“Absolutely,” his dad cheered on. “Catherine would totally be stoked to hear from you. She’s always seen the greatness in you, even when you couldn’t see it yourself.”
 
-o-

Eddie took a step back from the solid workbench, swiping the back of his hand across his forehead to clear the sweat. With a flourish, he stuffed the final ingredients into robust wooden crates, ready for their journey down to the bustling apothecary below. He paused for a second, taking in the impressive organisation he had pulled off, a wave of pride swelling within him
“Okay, Dad, I’m heading down,” he shouted, striding towards the door that opened to the twisting staircase. The doorframe creaked like it was just as eager to escape as he was.
But just as he was about to swing the door open, Mr. Welton’s voice stopped him in his tracks. “Eddie, hold up for a second. could you hang around for just a little while longer? I've got one more favour to ask of you.&quot;
Eddie spun around, his curiosity ignited like a spark in a dark room. “Another favor?” What is it?”
Mr. Welton propped himself against the workbench, the morning light streaming in and painting warm shadows across his face.
“So, there’s this thing that popped up in my head, and I could really use your help with it.”
“What sort of thing are we talking about here?” Eddie asked, a twist of anxiety churning in his gut.
“It’s nothing too complicated, I swear,” his dad said, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth, but it didn’t do much to ease Eddie’s nerves. “Just a little tidbit I think you’ll find interesting.”
Mr. Welton’s smile dimmed just a touch as he bent down beneath the workbench, retrieving a small, intricately designed cage. Within the confines of the cage itself, a lovely songbird flitted about, its radiant feathers shimmering in the soft glow of the light. 
“Let this songbird go free,” Mr. Welton said, his voice a mix of kindness and authority. “It’s time for it to spread its wings and soar.”
Eddie paused, a surge of protectiveness washing over him for the tiny creature.
“But… it’s a songbird.” It could totally go missing or end up in a bit of trouble.”
“Songbirds are meant to sing and soar, not be caged,” his father said, the warmth in his voice clashing with the unease bubbling up inside Eddie. “Seriously, just let it slide.”
With a heavy sigh, Eddie stepped forward, gently accepting the cage from his father's grasp. As he opened the cage’s door, the songbird paused for a heartbeat, then erupted into the air, its wings a flurry of motion as it ascended into the vastness of the sky, a vibrant splash of colour against the endless blue. Eddie observed its departure, a bittersweet sensation unfurling within his heart.
“And just like that, she is free,” Mr. Welton declared, a spark of triumph dancing in his gaze.
Eddie spun around to face his dad, the heavy cloak of uncertainty still draped over his shoulders.
“Alright, but what’s the deal with that?”
Mr. Welton's face transformed into a mask of mischievous gravity.
“Alright, I've got another task for you.”
Mr. Welton then went on digging under the workbench again, he found a bigger, more elaborate cage. The morning light illuminated a gorgeous Fire Falcon in its cage, its plumage shimmering like liquid gold. The bird's ferocious glance fell on Eddie, and he suddenly saw its magnificent majesty. 
“Let this one go, too,” Mr. Welton said, his voice playful.
Eddie's eyes went as wide as saucers. “You want me to release the Fire Falcon?” But it’s worth a fortune! You can’t just let it go!&quot;
Mr. Welton leaned in closer, a glint of mischief dancing in his eyes. “How about I wager you a hundred gold coins?”
“A hundred gold coins?” Eddie found himself caught in a whirlwind of temptation, the thrill of the wager tugging at him while his instincts screamed to safeguard the awe-inspiring beast before him. “But it’s a Fire Falcon!”
“Exactly,” Mr. Welton said, a grin spreading across his face like he’d just uncovered a hidden treasure. “This isn’t merely about the wager; it’s about daring to leap into the unknown.” Consider it a crash course in bravery.”
Eddie paused, a storm of thoughts battling it out in his mind. “But what if it just doesn’t return?”
“Well, I guess that’s how the universe works,” Mr. Welton said, his eyes unwavering. “Sometimes, you’ve got to release your grip to discover what treasures await you.”
Eddie let out a reluctant sigh, his head bobbing in agreement as he fought to push down the knot of apprehension twisting in his stomach. “Alright, I’ll do it.”
As he drew near the cage, Eddie inhaled deeply, his heart pounds. He opened the cage’s door and with a gentle push, urged the Fire Falcon onwards, anticipating its swift ascent into the sky. 
Yet, to his astonishment, the falcon stayed resolutely perched within the confines of the cage, its golden eyes locked onto him, as though contemplating the choices before it.
“Come on!” Eddie urged, his heart racing like a runaway chariot on a quest. “You’re meant to soar off into the sky!”
But the Fire Falcon just cocked its head to the side, refusing to budge. Eddie felt a heavy weight settle in his stomach as the truth dawned on him. “No way… this is not happening.”
Mr. Welton let out a hearty laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. “Well, well, well, it seems I’ve come out on top, son.”
Eddie was hit by a wave of disappointment, swirling with anger and confusion like a storm brewing in his chest. “Why not?” Why didn’t it just take off into the sky?
Mr. Welton's expression turned warm as he moved in closer. “Sometimes, Eddie, just like that falcon, we get a little too cosy in our cages. We hesitate to take that leap, even when the chance to escape is staring us in the face.”
Eddie lingered, the disappointment brushing against him like a cool breeze, as he reached for the meticulously arranged ingredients resting on the workbench. The vivid hues of the herbs and raw materials drew his gaze, yet his thoughts wandered, circling back to that moment when the Fire Falcon had stubbornly remained in its cage.
“Thanks for the lesson, Dad,” he said, managing a tight smile as he turned to face his father. 
He sensed the words dripped with sweetness, yet beneath the surface, frustration bubbled like a volcano ready to erupt. He wasn’t looking for some fancy metaphor about comfort zones and soaring through the skies—he just needed to find his own way forward.
As he approached the door, Eddie wore a mask of calm, resolute in his mission to keep the irritation simmering just below the surface a secret. “I’ll just take these to the Apothecary,” he said, trying to keep his voice cheerful, even though a storm of irritation brewed inside him. “Appreciate the, um, ‘lesson’.”
Mr. Welton observed his son's silhouette,worry reflected in his eyes. He could perceive the strain in Eddie’s shoulders, the manner in which his jaw clenched tightly. “Eddie,” he called after him, but the young man had already vanished through the door, descending the twisting staircase that spiralled down from the tower.
The lab door creaked shut behind Eddie as Mr. Welton leaned against the workbench, arms folded, watching his boy descend the stairs. His quiet sigh blended with the rich, aromatic alchemical concoctions around him. 
“Ah, Edward,” he murmured to himself, shaking his head slightly. “If only you could see what I see.”
Mr. Welton felt a deep ache in his chest, aware that Eddie was ensnared in a tangle of fear and reluctance. His heart ached for his son, longing to share the wisdom he had known through the years. He grasped, with a profound clarity, the anxieties that tethered souls to the ground, preventing them from taking flight.
“At times, one must allow them to navigate their own path,” he murmured, observing the final sight of Eddie as he faded from sight. 
“Do not remain in that cage, son,” he breathed softly, his voice a mere flutter in the air. “A vast realm lies ahead, eager for you to take flight.”</Text>

            <Title>[REV] Prologue</Title>
            <Text>&quot;By the gods! H-his face!&quot;
The girl's scream pierced through the silence that had blanketed the classroom, drawing the attention of the other students. 
All eyes turned towards him now, three boys stood at the center. The classroom smells of books, papers, chalks, and blood.  
The first, a boy kneeling on the coarse floorboards, clutched his face as blood oozed through his fingers, staining the wooden floorboards beneath him. His sobs were muffled, drowned out by the overwhelming horror of the moment. His wand, made of sturdy ashen oak and silver engraved accents lies in defeat in front of him. A dragon finally slain… But amidst its den.
The Second, stood over him, the second boy’s breath came hard and fast, his chest heaving. His fist was still clenched, the jade ring on his finger pulsing with a sickly green glow. The air around him crackled, the lingering green transmutation circle hovers over his hand. The mark of an Alchemist in training.
The duel. The anger. The need to win. It still burned in his chest, a fire refusing to die. But then, a voice broke through behind him… shaken and small.
&quot;E-Eddie?&quot;
“Stay back Markus,” The second boy said, “I got this—” 
“Eddie… his face…”
The voice was small, coming from behind him, The Third boy called Markus stood rigid, his face pale, his wide eyes locked on the scene before them. His hands twitched at his sides, as if wanting to reach for Eddie—then thinking better of it. 
&quot;What have you done?&quot; Markus said to him at last.
The glow of the ring flickered. Then, as if drained of life, it dimmed.
Eddie, the second boy blinked. The fire in his chest sputtered, giving way to something colder. He followed Markus’s gaze down—
And saw what he had done.
The Boy lay sprawled on the floorboards, blood seeping between his fingers as he clutched his face. His breathing ragged, wet and pitiful.
Eddie’s stomach lurched.
The duel was over. But the nightmare had just begun.
Whispers began, low and fearful at first, but quickly growing in intensity. Fingers pointed, eyes narrowed in disgust and fear. 
“Did you see that spell? isn’t that…”
“Isn’t it obvious?… And Welton just used it against him?”
“Yeah, look at him…” 
“Someone call the headmaster! Now!”
Eddie stood in the center of it all. The room felt too bright, the lamps flickering against the polished tables, illuminating every horrified stare. His breath came shallow, too fast. He could feel their eyes crawling over him, stripping him bare.
A sense of sickness. The jade ring on his finger sat cold and heavy, and it started to get heavier and heavier. an anchor dragging him down. The weight mounting and mounting. 
He followed their gazes—past the blood on the floor, past Markus’s stricken face—back to his own trembling hands. He looked at it, shaken.
The weight of what he had done pressed in, suffocating.
The door to the classroom burst open. 
Gusts of cold air followed, sweeping through the aftermath of the classroom. Then came the headmaster, his heavy robes rippling like a gathering storm. His gaze sharp enough to cut through the air itself.
Behind him, a procession of teachers flooded in, their presence a verdict before a trial had even begun. Nurses, and Healers pushed through the throng of students, ordering them to make way, their voices sharp and urgent. The Boy was lifted onto a stretcher, his bloodied hands weakly grasping at nothing, his screams still muffled. Someone pressed a cloth to his wound. Someone else muttered a healing incantation.
Eddie barely saw it… He don’t want to, 
A hand landed on his shoulder—firm.
He looked up. The headmaster’s eyes locked onto his, a silent decree of what was to come. No shouting, no accusations. Just the crushing certainty of what this meant.
The jade ring on Eddie’s index finger felt as heavy as the mountain itself, its magic… or whatever it had just conjured, now has long gone. 
He barely noticed as they took it away from him, his lifeline—his heirloom, as if the weight of the mountain has been lifted from his very index finger… he felt somewhat free… but he dreaded that feeling.
They led him away from the classroom, away from the chatter, away from the accusations.
The whispers followed him down the corridor, curling against the stone walls, not only his classroom, the whole hallway is filled with students poking their heads out of the classroom windows, muttering his fate in hushed, pitiless tones as Eddie continues his walk of shame. Aella Academy, the very institution itself seemed to recoil before him him—walls narrowing, shadows deepening, as if it could no longer bear to house him.
He had spent years dreaming of these halls. Studying, pushing himself, proving himself.
And now, step by step, it was all being stripped away. Death by a thousand cuts.
The end was waiting for him at the headmaster’s office. A place of judgment. A place of exile.
He knew his sentence had already been passed.
Edward Welton is going to be expelled.

            <Title>Chapter 5E</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine’s boots clicked softly on the stone path as she crossed the campus grounds, the foggy air curling around her like ghostly ribbons. Her scarf was pulled tight around her neck, and she buttoned her coat all the way up, her gloved hands tucked into her sleeves to fend off the creeping cold.
The lamplight from the faculty buildings spilled in golden puddles onto the walkway, but the rest of Edenfield was dim and quiet—students tucked away in their dorms or libraries, the hum of campus life reduced to stillness.
She reached the bus stop at the edge of the quad, where the wrought-iron sign swayed slightly in the breeze. The enchanted schedule flickered faintly, glowing with runes that shifted to show Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
With a quiet sigh, Madeleine sat down on the bench, the cold seeping through the wooden slats. She leaned back and let her head tilt toward the sky, watching her breath fog in the moonlight. 
Her gaze drifted out across the empty road, unfocused.
But her thoughts didn’t stay still for long. They circled back—inevitably—to her conversation with Walther.
He’d acted strangely. Not obviously so, but off. She’d known him since the start of term, shared a lab bench with him more days than not. He was reliable. Reserved. Never the type to get worked up about… anything, let alone one of her messy drawings.
He had never shown the slightest interest in her sketches before. Never once asked her where she got her ideas, let alone stared at one like he’d seen a ghost.
Why today?
Then it hit her. Of course. Walther had mentioned in passing—once, maybe twice—that he was studying the anatomy and vascular structures of South Alamirian Tigers. That was probably why the drawing caught his eye. That had to be it.
Still, something didn’t sit right.
She sat up straighter, her fingers curling against her knees. Wait.
Walther volunteered at the Sanctuary. But unlike her—who cleaned enclosures, administered salves, handled creature check-ups—Walther never worked in the physical sections. He was never on feeding duty, never in the recovery stables, never doing the dirty work. His role was… research. Always research.
He studied the creatures. Dissected their physiology through observation and notes. He didn’t care for them. He studied them.
And there was more. He volunteered with Edenfield’s Food Shelter Society. Madeleine remembered him saying that once, off-handedly, like it didn’t matter. They helped the city’s unhoused population. They delivered food, yes—but also went into places people didn’t like to talk about. Old tunnels, abandoned corners of the city. The underbelly.
Two things clicked. Then three. Then four.
Madeleine’s breath caught in her throat.
Research… deep anatomical knowledge… access to vulnerable populations… a strange, cold fascination with a creature that shouldn’t exist…
Her hand flew to her satchel, as if instinctively checking her sketches were still there.
Her face slowly paled, lips parting slightly as a horrible thought took shape. Not fully formed—but enough to cast a shadow over everything she’d been trying to ignore.
Could it be?
No. No, that’s insane… she told herself. But her gut didn’t agree. Her heart was thudding now, dull and fast beneath her scarf. The pieces didn’t fit perfectly—but they sat too close not to touch.
The wind picked up again, rustling the trees behind the shelter.
Madeleine stared ahead, her eyes wide, her breath held.
The bus rolled up in the distance. But she no longer felt the comfort of home awaiting her. Only a hollow, rising dread.

-o-

The bus hissed to a stop at the edge of Aetherell Reach. Madeleine didn’t wait for the doors to fully open before stepping down. She didn’t thank the driver—a small, almost sacred courtesy she never forgot. But tonight, it slipped her completely.
Her boots hit the pavement. Cold air bit at her cheeks.
She moved fast.
Madeleine spotted the phone booth at the corner just beyond the wrought-iron fence, tucked beneath a flickering lantern. She broke into a brisk jog, her satchel thudding against her side.
The glass door rattled in her grip. She shoved it open and stepped inside, heart pounding. The booth smelled of damp copper and dust, the glass fogged from the cold. Her breath ghosted across the surface as she picked up the receiver with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking.
She slipped a coin into the slot.
Dialled the number from memory.
The ring buzzed against her ear. Once. Twice.
C’mon, Eddie. Please pick up.

-o-

Eddie sat at his desk in the corner of Dormitory 7, shoulders hunched over a thick Alchemical textbook. The diagrams sprawled across the page in tight, looping script, encrypted formulas showing the delicate thresholds between copper and verdigris, gas and flame, matter and memory. Notes were scrawled in his own handwriting along the margins. The desk lamp hummed faintly, casting sharp shadows that danced with every flick of his pen.
He didn’t hear the guitar at first—barely registered the sound amid the quiet storm of his concentration. Will was on the bottom bunk, leaning against the bedframe, head bobbing slightly as he coaxed soft scales out of his guitar. Each note plucked from the strings glowed faintly in the air, trailing runes that pulsed and faded like sparks drifting on water.
The room was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the bunk frame, the gentle thrum of guitar strings, and the scratch of Eddie’s pen as he annotated a particularly difficult transfiguration formula.
He didn’t notice the sound of footsteps approaching.Didn’t register the hurried knock.Didn’t hear the door swing open.
&quot;Ashley?&quot; Will said, glancing up.
Ashley stood in the doorway, slightly breathless. Her eyes went straight to Eddie.“You’ve got a call,” she said. “It’s Madeleine. On the hall phone.”
Eddie looked up, blinking as if surfacing from underwater.“A call?” he repeated. “Now?”
Will grinned. “Oho, the mystery deepens. She finally cracked and confessed her undying—”
But Ashley didn’t laugh. She didn’t roll her eyes or shove him in the shoulder like she usually would.She just said, quietly, urgently, “Eddie. You need to come. Now.”
Eddie was already out of his chair.
Eddie jogged down the corridor, bare footsteps thudding against rough floorboards. The dorm hallway was mostly quiet—just the faint hum of lanterns and a distant laugh from someone two floors down. He rounded the corner and spotted the wall-mounted phone at the end of the corridor, its receiver swinging like a pendulum from the base.
His heart kicked up.
He grabbed it mid-swing. “Hello?”
There was a sharp breath of relief on the other end.“Eddie. It’s me.”
“Madeleine?” His back straightened. “Are you okay? You sound—”
“Listen,” she cut in, voice taut and quick, like a pulled string. “I don’t have time to explain. I need you. I need all of you—Will, Ashley, everyone—at the library. Tonight.”
Eddie blinked. “Wait, what’s happened? What’s going on?”
“It’s—” Her voice cut out for a second. A faint crackle distorted the line. “It’s Walther. I think he’s—”
Bzzzt.
A loud burst of static screamed through the receiver. Eddie yanked it away from his ear, flinching.
“Madeleine?” he called into the noise, trying the hook. “Hello? Madeleine?”
Silence. Then a low mechanical whir. Then nothing at all.
He glanced back down the hall as if expecting Ashley to still be there. “Come on…”
Suddenly—Click.
“Hello?” he tried again, breath held.
A gasp. “E-Eddie!”
He gripped the receiver tighter. “Madeleine, what’s happening?”
“I think someone’s following me.”
His stomach dropped. “Where are you?”
There was a pause. A rustle. Then, distantly: the creak of a booth door opening. Her voice dropped to a whisper.“I’m at my apartment. Just past the old fence. Near the east ward sign. There’s someone—he’s not moving, but—”
The line cracked again.
“I’ve got my wand—he’s coming closer—Eddie, I—”
Pop.
The line went dead.
Eddie stood there, frozen, the soft dial tone humming against his ear like a dirge.
Slowly, he lowered the receiver.
He turned.
Will and Ashley were already there at the end of the corridor. Ashley’s face was pale, tense—she’d heard enough to know. But it was Will’s expression that struck Eddie now: no smirk, no joke, just quiet alarm setting into his features like a stormcloud.
Eddie’s eyes met theirs. A flicker. A pause. A breathless moment where nothing needed to be said.
We’ve got to do something.
Ashley gave a sharp nod. Will was already moving.
They grabbed their jackets from the hooks near the dorm stairs, Will slinging his guitar bag over his shoulder out of instinct. No time to ask why. No time to prepare. Only the urgency in Eddie’s blood and the fading echo of Madeleine’s voice in his ear.
Then they stormed out into the night.
Through the arching gates of the dormitory. Across the frost-hushed campus. Their breath rose in quick clouds as they ran—past silent halls, over cobbled paths slick with dew, the gaslamps stretching their shadows long and fast.
Toward Aetherell Reach.
Toward her.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stepped off the ferry first, tossing a few coins to the ferryman before helping Torrie down onto the sturdy wooden planks of Osthaven’s dock. The air here was different—crisper, drier. Less of that thick, briny scent of fish that clung to Weshaven. Instead, the harbour was filled with the rich aromas of spice crates being unloaded, the earthy scent of dried herbs, and the occasional whiff of parchment and ink from merchants tallying their stock.
Osthaven was busier in a different way. Where Weshaven had the steady rhythm of fishermen mending nets and unloading the morning’s catch, Osthaven hummed with the brisk efficiency of trade. Men and women haggled over silk and spices from distant lands, warehouse workers hauled crates marked with foreign sigils, and couriers darted between carts carrying letters sealed with wax.
Torrie took it all in, wide-eyed. “It’s… bigger than I thought.”
Eddie smirked. “Told you. Less fish guts, more commerce.”
They moved through the streets, weaving past merchants arranging their displays and scholars in robes, their arms laden with books. As they walked, Eddie found his eyes drifting, the familiar streets pulling at old memories.
As they walked through the bustling streets of Osthaven, Eddie gestured toward a small stall by the corner, where the scent of roasted chestnuts wafted through the air.
&quot;See that?&quot; Eddie said, nudging Torrie. &quot;Markus and I used to stop there after classes. We'd split a bag of chestnuts and complain about assignments the whole way home.&quot;
Torrie looked over, her nose scrunching slightly. &quot;You two really bonded over complaining, huh?&quot;
Eddie smirked. &quot;It's an art form, I tell you.&quot;
They continued down the road, past the colorful stalls of cloth merchants, until Eddie’s gaze landed on a narrow shop with a faded green awning.
&quot;And that place,&quot; he pointed, &quot;Was where I used to get supplies for my... projects.&quot;
Torrie raised an eyebrow. &quot;What kind of 'projects'?&quot;
Eddie chuckled. &quot;Alchemy, mostly. The owner—grumpiest old man you'd ever meet—used to grumble about every single request I made, but he never actually turned me away.&quot;
Torrie grinned. &quot;Sounds like he liked you.&quot;
Eddie scoffed, shaking his head. “I think he just liked my coins.”
Eddie slowed slightly, his fingers brushing against the strap of his bag. It was strange, being back. The town hadn’t changed much, but everything felt different now.
Torrie noticed his lingering gaze. “You’ve been here a lot, huh?”
Eddie gave a small nod, exhaling softly. “Yeah… long ago.”
Torrie smiled. “Well, now I’m here too.”
Eddie chuckled, shaking off the weight of nostalgia. “Yeah. Let’s get you to Aella.”

-o-

Eddie pedaled through the last stretch of road, the cobbled streets of Osthaven giving way to packed dirt as they left the bustle of town behind. Fields of golden hay swayed gently in the morning breeze, stretching far and wide, their soft rustling the only sound accompanying them now.
And then, past the gentle slope of the hill, Aella Academy came into view.
It stood just as Eddie remembered—tall, sturdy, with its weathered stone walls and a modest courtyard nestled at its center. It wasn’t the grandest school in Solivia, not the kind spoken of in hushed reverence like Edenfield, but around here, it was everything. A place of learning, discipline, and quiet ambition.
Eddie slowed the bike to a stop near the front gate. Torrie hopped off, adjusting her satchel, her eyes gleaming as she took in the sight before her.
“Well,” she said, turning to him, a wide grin breaking across her face, “I guess this is it.”
 “You’ll do fine, Torrie.” Eddie said, forcing a small smirk. “You better not cause too much trouble.”
She stuck her tongue out playfully before stepping forward, her pace quickening until she was practically skipping through the front gate.
Eddie lingered by the entrance, watching her go. 
He saw himself in her.
The same eagerness, the same restless energy that had carried him through these very gates years ago. He remembered what it was like, standing on the threshold of something new, looking ahead and seeing only possibility.
Now, he stood on the other side of it.
Eddie let out a quiet breath, gripping the handles a little tighter before shaking his head.
“Go get ‘em, Torrie.”
And with that, he turned the bike around and started pedaling back towards town.

-o-

Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the hum of the town buzzing around him. The salty breeze had thinned, replaced by the scent of fresh bread, spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach reminded him, with a low grumble, that breakfast had been hurried.
He slowed to a stop near a familiar stall, the one that sold honeyed almonds and sesame biscuits. The sight alone pulled him back to old routines—grabbing a bag for himself, an extra for Markus. It had been a while, but some habits never quite faded.
After paying the vendor, he stepped back toward his bicycle, ready to sling the bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
A building stood across the street, its architecture different from the others around it. Age clung to its stone walls, yet the towering columns bore intricate carvings, their shapes unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, but their elegance remained, a relic of a bygone era.
Above the heavy wooden doors, an emblem was set in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into the worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, something stirring in his chest. He hadn’t noticed it before—maybe he had never cared to look. But now, standing there, it felt like the building was watching him back.
Eyes tracing the contours of the emblem, Eddie lingered a moment longer, the owl’s unblinking gaze seeming almost knowing. The Sage Institute. He knew nothing about it—had never needed to—but something about it gnawed at the edges of his mind. A curiosity, fleeting yet persistent.
With a breath, he shook it off, tucking the bag of snacks securely inside his satchel before turning back to his bicycle. The world outside his thoughts rushed back in—the chatter of merchants, the rhythmic clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the occasional call of dockworkers hauling cargo.
He swung a leg over the bike and pushed off, weaving through the streets of Osthaven with practiced ease. The town passed him by in a blur of nostalgia and familiarity, but his mind remained half elsewhere, lingering on the building, on the emblem, on the feeling.
The distant chime of a bell tower reminded him of the time. He wasn’t in a hurry, but he didn’t want to miss the next ferry back to Weshaven either.
By the time he reached the harbor, the ferry was already boarding. He rolled his bicycle up the gangway, found a quiet spot near the railing, and exhaled, letting the sea breeze wash over him.
Back to Weshaven. Back to his routines.

-o-

Eddie stepped off the ferry, the lingering scent of salt and fish clinging to his coat as he pedaled back through the familiar streets of Weshaven. The town moved at its usual pace—fishermen hauling in their morning catches, merchants calling out their wares, the rhythmic hammering of shipwrights at work. It felt routine, but his thoughts still lingered on Osthaven, on Aella, on the emblem of the owl perched on a scroll.
By the time he reached the apothecary, the comforting scent of herbs and simmering potions greeted him like an old friend. He pushed open the wooden door and stepped into the brewing room, where golden light streamed through the lofty windows, casting long, shifting shadows.
A deep but gentle voice called out from the far end of the room, its warmth filling the space like the heat of a hearth.
&quot;Morning, Edward!&quot;
Markus stood hunched over his workstation, his broad frame making the desk seem almost too small for him. His wild curls peeked out from under his cap, and a faint flush colored his round cheeks—likely from standing over boiling cauldrons all morning. 
He was a large presence in every sense, but his movements were measured, careful, and full of practiced ease as he stirred a simmering mixture, his huge hands treating delicate ingredients with surprising gentleness.
Eddie smirked and reached into his satchel. &quot;Got you something.&quot;
Markus glanced up, his dark eyes curious as Eddie handed over a small paper bag. A familiar scent wafted from within.
&quot;You didn’t,&quot; Markus breathed, opening the bag to reveal golden-brown roasted chestnuts. His expression flickered between delight and nostalgia.
&quot;Stopped by the old stall,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Figured you’d appreciate it.&quot;
&quot;You really do know how to make a guy’s morning.&quot; Markus chuckled, popping one into his mouth and sighing contentedly. &quot;So, how’d it go? With Torrie, I mean.&quot;
&quot;Good. Aella still looks like Aella.&quot; Eddie exhaled, glancing past Markus as if he could still see the academy in the distance. &quot;Nothing much has changed since we were there.&quot;
Markus hummed, a small smile tugging at his lips. &quot;I bet she was buzzing with excitement.&quot;
&quot;Practically skipping through the gates,&quot; Eddie admitted with a chuckle.
Markus laughed, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, that sounds about right.&quot; He rolled up his sleeves, returning his focus to the potion before him. &quot;She’s gonna do great there, you know. Always knew she had it in her.&quot;
Eddie didn’t respond immediately, just nodded, watching the steam rise from Markus’s cauldron.
For a moment, it was like old times.
Eddie had just popped a chestnut into his mouth when Markus spoke, his voice casual but laced with meaning.
“Oh, by the way—Mr. Welton wants to see you earlier.”
Eddie froze mid-chew. A slow, creeping realization dawned on him.
He was supposed to hand over the formula today.
“Damn it—I forgot!” He shot upright,  swallowed hard, nearly choking. nearly knocking over a stack of parchment on the counter.
“Yeah, figured.” Markus raised an amused brow, still munching on his snack. “He’s already up at the tower.”
Cursing under his breath, Eddie spun on his heel and bolted toward the stairs. His boots thudded against the wooden steps as he rushed to his desk, rummaging through scattered notes, ink-stained pages, and unfinished drafts. Where the hell was it?
He shoved aside a worn-out alchemy textbook, and there it was—the carefully scribed formula, buried beneath a pile of old scribbles.
Snatching it up, he didn’t waste another second. He turned on his heel and sprinted towards the tower, heart pounding.</Text>

            <Text>

The air between them crackled with unresolved tension. Torrie seized the moment, her frustration bubbling over. “You’re seriously not going to say anything about it? You’ve just gone quiet again. Don’t you care?” 

Eddie, still processing the shot, struggled to find the right words. He opened his mouth, then closed it again, trying to make sense of everything. 

“Look, Torrie. It’s not that it doesn’t fascinate me,” Eddie said finally, his voice strained. “There’s just... nothing else to discuss. I don’t know what else to say about her.” 

Torrie’s expression shifted from frustration to something more accusatory. Her eyes narrowed. Her voice rose, barely containing the anger simmering beneath the surface. “You used to be so eager to meet Catherine. You’d spend hours talking about her, sharing everything you learned from her with me. Now, you act like she’s just another stranger. She noticed it, too—she was confused and disappointed by your reaction. Doesn’t that bother you?” 

Eddie’s face flushed, his patience wearing thin. He shook his head, frustrated by her insistence. “It’s not that simple. You don’t understand—” 

Torrie cut him off, her voice trembling with emotion. “Don’t I? You used to be passionate about magic, Eddie. You looked up to Catherine like she was some kind of hero. But now you’re just... a shell of your former self. You’ve completely shut down!” 

The accusation hung heavily in the air, and Eddie felt a pang of guilt. His hands clenched around the rifle, knuckles white. 

Torrie’s tears began to flow, her voice breaking with each word. “Don’t you feel bad for her, Ed? Magic used to be your life! You used to dream about it, and now you just act like it’s nothing. What happened to you? Just because you scarred a boy’s face during a duel doesn’t mean you should give it up!” 

Eddie’s face contorted with anger and pain. He stood up abruptly, his voice rising in frustration. “I didn’t just scar him, Torrie! I ruined his life. I didn’t just get expelled from the academy—I destroyed someone’s future, and I’ve done it countless times! Magic wasn’t just a hobby but a weapon, and I used it recklessly.” 

Torrie’s eyes widened in shock, her tears flowing freely now. “You’re just using that as an excuse! You’ve let one mistake define you. You’ve let it make you cold and distant. Aunt Catherine returned expecting to see the old you, full of wonder and ambition. Instead, she finds someone who’s given up on everything that used to matter.” 

Eddie’s voice cracked as he shouted back. “You think I wanted this? Do you think I wanted to become this person? It’s not just about one mistake—it’s about everything I lost because of it. I can’t just turn it back on like a switch.” 

The argument continued to escalate, their voices echoing off the surrounding trees. The once-gentle glow of the Eden Flowers seemed to flicker—more erratically this time—casting long, wavering shadows around them. The silent and watchful forest seemed to hold its breath as the siblings’ emotions spilt out. 

Torrie, flushed with anger and hurt, took a step back. “You’ve changed so much, Eddie. It’s like you’re not even the same person anymore.” 

Panting and shaken, Eddie looked at her with regret and defiance. “Maybe I’m not. Maybe I can’t be the person I was before. You don’t know what it’s like to live with the consequences of your actions.” 

For a moment, the forest seemed to close around them, the weight of their argument pressing down on both of them. The glow of the Luminas felt colder, and the distance between them seemed to widen with every harsh word. 

Torrie’s tears continued to flow, her voice a whisper of anguish. “I just... I wish you could see how much we still need that part of you, Eddie. The part that believed in magic believed in the good it could do.” 

The tension between Eddie and Torrie still hung in the air as they sat by the Traveller's Path. The sound of hurried footsteps and ragged breathing shattered the silence. 

Markus burst through the trees, his face pale, eyes wide with fear, his grip tight on the flintlock rifle. He staggered to a stop, chest heaving, his breath coming in desperate gasps. 

&quot;Eddie!&quot; Markus shouted, his voice trembling. His knuckles were white as he clutched the rifle. Instinctively raising it as though expecting danger at any moment. &quot;Something's happened! Catherine... she's in trouble. There's something huge in there—&quot; 

Eddie was instantly on his feet, his body tense, ready to act. &quot;Alright, alright, calm down, Markus. What is it? What happened to Catherine?&quot; His voice was sharp, but concern laced his words. 

Markus's eyes flickered, scanning the dark forest behind him. &quot;I—it's like a dragon, but it has six pairs of red eyes!&quot; 

Eddie's breath caught in his throat. His mind raced as he processed the description. The rifle in Markus's hands trembled. The barrel still pointed toward the trees as if he were unsure whether to aim at something or someone. 

“It’s the fucking sentinel, the Nightingale Dragon.”

Eddie's heart pounded as he imagined Catherine. She had always been a symbol of strength and wonder in his life, facing such a formidable foe. The terror was palpable, a suffocating weight pressing down on him. He could feel his hands trembling, his mind racing with the gravity of the situation. 

But amidst the fear, a realisation took hold. Eddie was the only one present who could confront the Nightingale Fox. Markus was panicked. Torrie, though brave, was not yet equipped for such a dire confrontation. It fell to him—Eddie—to face the creature. 

Eddie's fear crystallised into fierce determination. He had to protect Catherine, to prove to himself that he could rise to the challenge despite his past. With a deep breath, he forced himself to focus, pushing aside the paralysing dread and replacing it with a steely resolve. 

Without a word, Eddie grabbed his rifle from Markus. His fingers tightened around the cold wood of the stock. 

Eddie reached into his satchel and pulled out a small, worn bag of gunpowder. He tore open the pouch, the dry powder spilling between his fingers. His brow furrowed with focus as he raised the rifle's hammer, pouring the gunpowder into the pan. The powder swirled, settling in the shallow basin, a moment of calm before the storm. With a soft snap, he closed the frizzen, securing the charge. 

Then, with swift, practised motions. Eddie poured the rest of the gunpowder into the barrel, feeling the weight of the weapon shift as he worked. He placed a round into the barrel, the heavy ball resting on the powder. Without hesitation, he tapped it with the ramrod, pushing the round firmly down into place. The motion was fluid and efficient—every action was a well-practised part of the ritual. 

Finally, he stood tall, the rifle primed and ready for whatever awaited. He looked at Markus, his voice calm but carrying the weight of his resolve. &quot;Stay here with Torrie,&quot; he ordered, his voice sharp, though his insides churned with concern. &quot;I'm going after her.&quot; 

Torrie's eyes blazed with concern and anger as she jumped up, her voice rising in desperation. &quot;Eddie, this is insane! You can't just go off into the forest after what Markus described. It's too dangerous!&quot; 

Eddie's expression was determined as he started moving towards the forest. &quot;I don't have time to argue, Torrie. Catherine's in danger.&quot; 

As Eddie took a step forward, Torrie, in a last-ditch effort, thrust something into his hands. It wasn't a wand but a small, smooth object, cold to the touch. Eddie's gaze flickered to it in surprise. It was his old heirloom, a jade ring set securely within a silver band. He'd never known his real family, but the ring was a silent reminder of them, a conduit for magic passed down through generations. It had always been a part of his history, even though he knew so little about the family it came from. 

&quot;Take this,&quot; Torrie insisted, her voice unwavering despite the tremble in her hands. &quot;You may not want it, but it's better than nothing. Edward, please.&quot; 

Eddie looked at the ring, his expression conflicted. &quot;I don't need it,&quot; he said, shaking his head. &quot;I can handle this on my own.&quot; 

Torrie's eyes filled with a mixture of pleading and frustration. &quot;Just take it. You owe it to yourself and to Catherine.&quot; 

Realising she wouldn't back down. Eddie pocketed the ring, his fingers brushing against its cold, familiar surface. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said. 

Eddie turned and moved past the protective ring of glowing Luminas. Stepping into the darkened forest. As he ventured further into the unknown, the shadows seemed to close around him. The protective flower's glow dimmed behind him, leaving the path uncertain. </Text>

            <Text>The air crackled with a tension so thick it felt like a living thing, a suffocating shroud around Eddie, Ashley, and Will. Walt stood opposite them, a dark sorcerer cloaked in shadows, his power a tangible presence that pulsed with a malevolent energy. Sparks danced between his fingertips, a chilling display of the raw magic at his command.
&quot;You think you can stop me?&quot; Walt spat, his voice dripping with disdain. &quot;Pathetic fools. You're nothing but children playing at magic, wielding trinkets against the tide.&quot;
Eddie felt a surge of anger course through him. He ripped off his cloak, revealing the bandolier and satchel strapped across his chest – his arsenal of potions and concoctions glinting defiantly in the dim light. &quot;We're not children, Walt,&quot; he growled, his voice laced with a steely resolve. &quot;We may not have your brute force, but we have something far more potent – the will to fight for what's right.&quot;
Ashley mirrored his defiance, her grip tightening on the ornately carved battle staff she'd snatched from the armory. Her eyes, usually sparkling with warmth, now burned with a fierce determination. &quot;You won't get past us, Walt. Not today.&quot;
Will, his face etched with a quiet determination, slung his electric guitar into position. The familiar weight of the instrument felt grounding amidst the chaos. He connected it to the portable amp strapped to his back, a silent promise of the unconventional magic he wielded. &quot;We may not have your raw power,&quot; he said, his voice ringing with a quiet strength, &quot;but we have something you'll never understand – trust. We trust each other, and that, Walt, is a power all its own.&quot;
Walt's eyes narrowed, a flicker of something akin to surprise crossing his features for a fleeting moment. But it was quickly replaced by a cold fury. &quot;Trust? You think that childish sentiment will protect you from the inevitable?&quot; He raised a hand, dark energy swirling around it. &quot;Then prepare to face the consequences of your naivety!&quot;
With a snarling battle cry, Walt unleashed a torrent of dark magic. The air itself seemed to warp under the strain, and a wave of raw power slammed into the makeshift trio. Eddie, Ashley, and Will, their faces grim with determination, met the attack head-on. The battle had begun.
In a whirlwind of motion, Walt unleashed a torrent of magic, bolts of crackling energy aimed squarely at Eddie, Ashley, and Will. The makeshift trio, their faces grim with determination, launched into a desperate ballet of evasion. Eddie, with a flick of his wrist, sent a vial of glowing blue potion sailing through the air. It struck Walt's barrier a split second before detonation, erupting in a burst of blinding light and acrid smoke. Blinking back tears caused by the sudden brightness, Walt stumbled back, momentarily disoriented.
Ashley seized the opportunity. With a battle cry that echoed through the narrow corridor, she swung her staff, its tip glowing with an emerald light. A shimmering wave of energy surged forth, slamming into Walt's chest and sending him staggering back. He roared in frustration, the dark energy crackling around him intensifying with each passing moment.
Will, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs, poured his soul into his music. The once cheerful melody he usually played had morphed into a discordant symphony of defiance. The very air vibrated with the raw power of his emotions, a sonic assault that disrupted Walt's concentration and caused the tendrils of dark magic to sputter and die.
But Walt was a formidable opponent. Even weakened and disoriented, he remained a terrifying force. With a guttural growl, he unleashed another barrage of magic, the bolts finding their mark with an accuracy honed by years of dark practice. Eddie cried out in pain as a stray bolt grazed his arm, a sizzling burn blooming across his skin. Ashley, her staff clattering to the ground as she was struck by a bolt of energy, crumpled to the floor.
Panic threatened to consume Will, but the sight of his friends falling only steeled his resolve. He strummed his guitar with renewed ferocity, the music morphing into a desperate plea for aid. A silent message, a beacon of hope piercing through the chaos, lanced outwards, searching for any who might hear his call.
In the dim recesses of the cellar, the captives huddled together, their faces etched with terror. But amidst the fear, a flicker of hope ignited. The raw emotion pouring from Will's music resonated within them, a shared connection that transcended the physical barrier separating them from the battle raging above.
As if in response to Will's desperate plea, a faint tremor echoed through the stone walls. The tremor intensified, growing into a deafening rumble that shook the very foundations of the fortress. Dust rained down from the ceiling, and cobwebs swayed precariously in their corners. The captives exchanged startled glances, a sliver of uncertainty mingling with the nascent hope that had taken root within them.
From the outside world, the sound of a colossal explosion shattered the tense silence. The fortress, once an imposing silhouette against the twilight sky, shuddered violently. A plume of smoke and debris erupted from the battlements, spewing outwards like a monstrous flower blooming in slow motion.
Christine, Geralt, and Henry, who had been preparing to launch their rescue mission, exchanged stunned looks. The fortress, seemingly impregnable moments ago, was now under attack. Relief warred with apprehension within them. Help had arrived, but at what cost? The battle lines had shifted, but the true test was yet to come.
In the midst of the chaos, the captives watched with wide eyes, their hopes riding on the shoulders of their friends. Eddie, Ashley, and Will fought with a ferocity born of desperation, their determination unwavering even as the odds seemed stacked against them.
But as the battle raged on, it became clear that they were locked in a stalemate. Walt was powerful, too powerful, and every blow they landed seemed to only fuel his fury. Eddie, Ashley, and Will exchanged a knowing glance, their silent communication speaking volumes.
&quot;We can't keep this up forever,&quot; Ashley said, her voice strained but determined.
&quot;We have to find a way to end this,&quot; Will replied, his fingers flying over the strings of his guitar as he unleashed another barrage of sound.
And with that shared resolve burning in their hearts, Eddie, Ashley, and Will redoubled their efforts, pouring every ounce of their strength and magic into the fight. They may not have been winning, but they refused to give up. Not while there was still a chance to protect their friends and emerge victorious against the dark magician who threatened everything they held dear.
-o-
The air around Henry crackled with the raw energy of the unseen battle raging within the fortress. His muscles tensed, every fiber of his being yearning to join the fight. Behind him, Christine, Geralt, and the freed captives huddled together, their faces etched with a mixture of relief and apprehension.
Christine's voice, sharp and laced with urgency, cut through the tension. &quot;Henry, remember the plan. We create a distraction, get the others to safety, then we provide backup. Charging in now is just…&quot;
&quot;Suicide?&quot; Henry finished the sentence for her, his voice tight with frustration. The booming echoes of battle grew louder, a constant reminder of the danger his friends faced. &quot;I can't just stand here while they…&quot;
The plan, the one they'd meticulously crafted, felt like shackles in this moment. His loyalty, his very soul, resonated with the desperate pleas pouring out from the music – Will's music – a beacon cutting through the chaos.
A steely resolve hardened his features. &quot;Screw the plan,&quot; he muttered, his voice barely a whisper above the din. &quot;They need me. I'm going in.&quot;
Christine lunged forward, her hand reaching out to grab his arm, but Henry was already a blur of motion, disappearing into the dark maw of the fortress entrance. Her protests died in her throat as she watched him vanish, a wave of worry washing over her.
Geralt placed a hand on Christine's shoulder, his gaze locked on the imposing structure. &quot;We follow, but cautiously. Henry may be impulsive, but he wouldn't break ranks unless it was critical.&quot;
Christine nodded, her eyes filled with a fierce determination that mirrored Henry's. They had a job to do – ensure the safety of the freed captives while providing support for the fight within.
Inside the fortress, Henry navigated the labyrinthine corridors, his senses on high alert. The thrumming of magic echoed from somewhere deeper, guiding him towards the heart of the conflict. He finally burst into the communication channels room, his breath catching in his throat at the sight before him.
Fred, his face contorted in a snarl, was locked in a brutal magical duel with a pair of cloaked cultists. Bolts of energy crackled in the air, the very room humming with volatile power. Without a second thought, Henry threw himself into the fray. His dwarven automaton gauntlet, a marvel of engineering, whirred to life as he unleashed a torrent of arcane energy.
The cultists whirled around, surprise momentarily flickering across their features before hardening into murderous intent. &quot;Another fool joins the fray!&quot; one of them bellowed, his voice distorted by the shadows of his hood.
&quot;Think a glorified machine can stop us?&quot; the other sneered, his hands crackling with dark magic.
Henry gritted his teeth, his resolve unwavering. &quot;It's not just a machine,&quot; he growled, the gauntlet amplifying his voice to a metallic boom. &quot;It's the future you so desperately cling to the past to destroy!&quot;
The room erupted in chaos as the battle lines shifted. Fred, a manic glint in his eyes, threw his head back and let out a booming laugh. &quot;Welcome to the party, Henry! Knew you wouldn't be able to resist the fireworks!&quot;
Just as the clash seemed to reach a fever pitch, the door to the communication room burst open once more. Christine and Geralt stood framed in the doorway, their faces grim but resolute. With a deafening roar, Christine unleashed a wave of pure magical energy, sending the cultists flying backward into the far wall.
As the dust settled, the two remaining cultists lay groaning on the floor, their dark magic dispelled. Christine and Geralt stood side-by-side, their eyes scanning the room before landing on Henry.
Henry lowered his gauntlet, a sheepish grin spreading across his face. &quot;So… about that plan…&quot;
Christine shook her head, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. &quot;If you're going to be an idiot, Henry,&quot; she said, her voice laced with mock seriousness, &quot;don't do it alone. Let's go finish this.&quot;

            <Title>Chapter 13</Title>
            <Text>The carriage creaked to a halt in front of a weathered farmyard. Gunther’s Farm marked the northernmost point the driver was willing to take them. Beyond this, the journey would continue on foot.
Eddie stepped out first, the cool northern wind brushing against his face as he glanced toward the horizon. A vast expanse of waving grass stretched ahead, glowing faintly in the soft light of the setting sun. Torrie followed, holding her bag tightly as her eyes darted around the quiet farmyard.
&quot;This is where we part ways, folks,&quot; the driver said gruffly, tipping his hat. &quot;Best of luck to you. Deep Glaive’s not a place I’d go wanderin’ after dark.&quot;
&quot;Noted,&quot; Markus replied, slinging his pack over his shoulder. &quot;Thanks for the ride.&quot;
The group began their trek northward, the golden sea of grass swaying rhythmically as a gentle breeze carried the scent of earth and wildflowers. Their shadows stretched long and lean under the waning sunlight. The land ahead gradually sloped upward, and as they crested a small hill, the forest of Deep Glaive came into view.
At first glance, it seemed underwhelming. A scattered cluster of saplings, small bushes, and a few modestly sized trees lined the edge. Markus stopped and crossed his arms, tilting his head with a skeptical smirk.
&quot;This is it?&quot; he asked, glancing at Catherine. &quot;This is the infamous Deep Glaive? Doesn’t seem so... deep. Looks more like a glorified garden.&quot;
Torrie giggled, and even Eddie smirked, but Catherine didn’t take the bait. She simply regarded the forest with a calm, knowing expression.
&quot;That’s because you’re standing on the shallow end,&quot; she replied, her voice measured.
Markus raised an eyebrow. &quot;Shallow end? What’s that supposed to mean?&quot;
Catherine turned toward him, gesturing to the trees ahead. &quot;The Deep Glaive isn’t an ordinary forest. It’s enchanted—alive, in a way. It mimics the ocean. The closer you stay to the edges, the smaller everything seems. But as you go deeper...&quot; She trailed off, her gaze drifting to the horizon.
Markus frowned, his earlier bravado faltering. &quot;And what happens as we go deeper?&quot;
&quot;The trees grow larger. The creatures more dangerous. The forest doesn’t just grow—it transforms,&quot; Catherine explained, her tone steady but laced with a hint of caution. &quot;It’s why they call it the Deep Glaive. You won’t understand the scale until you’re standing in the heart of it.&quot;
Markus rubbed the back of his neck, his confidence wavering. &quot;Great. That’s... comforting.&quot;
Eddie glanced at Torrie, who seemed undeterred, her curious gaze fixed on the unassuming trees ahead. She was practically bouncing with excitement, which only made Markus mutter, &quot;Kid’s fearless, huh?&quot; under his breath.
The group pressed onward, stepping into the forest’s threshold. The moment they crossed the invisible boundary, the air changed. It grew cooler, denser, and carried a faint hum, as though the forest itself was alive and watching.
As they ventured into the gathering dusk, the world around them grew quieter. Their footsteps and the distant calls of seabirds were the sounds they could hear. The path ahead was long, and the mysteries of the Deep Glaive awaited. 

The path they had been following gave way to a darker earth. The cobblestones disappear beneath layers of fallen leaves. Catherine's party is approaching the edge of the Deep Glaive. The sun was now just a sliver on the horizon, casting the last rays of daylight through the trees. As they drew nearer, the forest ahead seemed almost unremarkable—a small cluster of trees, their branches swaying gently in the evening breeze. But as they crossed the threshold into the forest, the air seemed to shift. 

It became cooler, denser, and more vibrant. The small, unassuming trees began to grow taller. Their trunks thickened, and their canopies stretched higher into the sky. The underbrush, once sparse, now teemed with strange, luminescent flora, casting an otherworldly glow on the path ahead. 
Eddie glanced at Markus, who was inspecting the vibrant moss clinging to a nearby trunk. &quot;Do you feel that?&quot; Eddie asked, his voice hushed.
&quot;The air’s richer,&quot; Markus replied, brushing his fingers across the moss. &quot;Like the forest itself is alive.&quot;
Torrie trailed behind them. She looked up, craning her neck to take in the towering trees. Their trunks spiraled skyward, their leaves forming an interwoven canopy so thick it blocked out the remnants of the evening light. Shadows danced across her freckled face, and her voice piped up, soft but curious. &quot;Is it night already?&quot;
Catherine, leading the group, paused and turned to Torrie with a small smile. &quot;Not quite,&quot; she said. Her silver hair shimmered faintly, catching the luminescence of the forest flora. &quot;The deeper we go, the larger the forest grows. This is the Deep Glaive—an Illusory Forest. It’s not just a place, but a world within itself. Like the ocean, it swells with depth. The trees grow taller, the creatures larger, the magic stronger.&quot;
Torrie's eyes widened. &quot;So, it’s like we’re walking into... another layer of reality?&quot;
&quot;Precisely,&quot; Catherine said, stepping forward again. &quot;The Deep Glaive is an ancient place, shaped by spells older than any of us. It doesn’t follow the rules of the outside world.&quot;
Markus chuckled softly as he joined Catherine, tapping the flask on his belt. &quot;And yet, here we are, bringing mundane supplies into a place like this. It’s humbling, isn’t it?&quot;
Eddie remained quiet, his eyes darting between the glowing plants and the shifting shadows. Despite Catherine’s calm explanation, there was something unnerving about the way the forest seemed to press in on them. The path was no longer clear cobblestones but a soft, spongy surface underfoot, rich with fallen leaves and vines that seemed to writhe faintly in the periphery of his vision.
“We’re getting closer to the forest’s center. Stay vigilant. Not all creatures here are friendly, and illusions can play tricks on the mind.&quot;
Torrie shivered, her earlier wonder giving way to nervousness. She edged closer to Eddie. &quot;What kind of creatures?&quot;
Markus threw her a reassuring grin. &quot;Big ones.&quot;
As they ventured further, the luminescent plants grew brighter, painting the towering trees in hues of blue and green. The hum grew louder, joined by faint rustlings in the dense underbrush. Shadows flickered at the edges of their vision, always just out of focus.
They trudged forward, their footsteps crunching softly against the dense forest floor. The air seemed heavier now, as though the forest itself were holding its breath. Shadows shifted in the dim light, and the towering trees pressed closer.
Torrie broke the silence, her voice hesitant but curious. &quot;Are we in the center of the forest yet?&quot;
Catherine glanced back at her, a small smile playing on her lips. &quot;Not quite,&quot; she said, gesturing toward the dense wall of trees ahead. &quot;We’re at the Gates.&quot;
&quot;The Gates?&quot; Torrie echoed, her brow furrowing.
Catherine nodded. &quot;The Gates to the forest’s heart. If you know where to look—and what to do—you can open them. Only then will we truly reach the center.&quot;
The group exchanged wary glances, and Eddie adjusted the strap of his satchel. &quot;So... how exactly do we ‘open’ them?&quot;
&quot;Follow me,&quot; Catherine said, her voice calm and assured. She led the way forward, her staff tapping lightly against the forest floor.
As they trudged forward, a subtle shift occurred—the forest began to open up. The trees parted to reveal a circular clearing, illuminated by an eerie golden glow. In the center was a patch of delicate, circularly arranged yellow flowers. Their petals seemed to shimmer faintly, as though catching a light that wasn’t there.
Catherine stopped abruptly, and the others nearly bumped into her. She gestured toward the center of the clearing. &quot;There it is.&quot;
At the heart of the space was a patch of delicate yellow flowers, their petals arranged in a near-perfect circle. They seemed to shimmer faintly, catching and reflecting light that wasn’t visible to the naked eye.
Catherine let out a soft breath, her expression a mix of awe and satisfaction. &quot;The Eden Flowers,&quot; she murmured, kneeling beside them. Her hands brushed lightly over the petals, careful not to disturb their fragile beauty. &quot;I didn’t think we’d find them this deep.&quot;
Torrie dropped to her knees beside Catherine, her wide eyes captivated by the flowers’ soft luminescence. &quot;Are they special?&quot; she asked, her voice filled with wonder.
Catherine nodded. &quot;They are here,” Catherine said, “But not in a city called Edenfield where they’re from, but in ancient times, they were widely cultivated. Eden Flowers are incredibly receptive to magic—ideal for enchantments, alchemical transmutations, and even energy storage. These might have been planted centuries ago, perhaps by one of the Nine Sages themselves.&quot;
Markus raised an eyebrow. &quot;Edenfield’s namesake, right?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Catherine replied, her voice tinged with admiration. &quot;This was their legacy. A flower that could shape entire eras of magic. And now... we need them to guide us through this place.&quot;
She stood, brushing the dirt from her gloves. &quot;I’ll prepare a transmutation circle to reveal a safe path. But first, I’ll need light.&quot;
“Sure,” Eddie glanced at Markus. &quot;Got a flashlight?&quot;
Markus’s eyes widened. &quot;Oh, damn it. I think I left it back at the pack.&quot;
&quot;You’re joking.&quot; Eddie pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration mounting.
Markus scratched the back of his head, his sheepish grin doing little to help. &quot;Sorry. Guess I thought the forest would provide enough glow.&quot;
The group scrambled for a solution. Torrie waved her wand, attempting to conjure an illumination spell, but only managed a few flickering sparks. Markus rummaged through his bag, muttering apologies under his breath. Even Catherine seemed momentarily at a loss, her expression taut with the urgency of their situation.
Eddie let out a groan. &quot;Fine. I’ve got this.&quot;
He reached into his coat and pulled out a wand. It was plain, its wood worn smooth from years of use, but as he held it, a subtle warmth spread through his fingertips. He focused, muttering a quiet incantation under his breath.
The tip of the wand ignited with a small flame, fuelled by the gunpowder he had been carrying. The fire hovering just above the wood. It flickered and danced, casting warm, golden light across the clearing.
&quot;There,&quot; Eddie said, holding the wand high. The firelight illuminated Catherine and the flowers, the glow accentuating their delicate beauty.
The flame cast dancing shadows on their faces, illuminating Catherine’s smile, her features softening in the firelight. She nodded approvingly. &quot;Good work, Eddie. That’s perfect.&quot;
Markus raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised, but didn't comment further. Torrie, on the other hand, couldn’t hide her curiosity. &quot;You—You’ve still got it, huh?&quot; she asked, a bit in awe.
Eddie shrugged it off, not meeting her gaze. &quot;I just burned the spare gunpowder for light, that’s all. Catherine needed it, and nobody else had one.&quot; 
&quot;Hold the light steady,&quot; she instructed. &quot;This will take precision.&quot;
Eddie nodded, his hand unwavering as Catherine began tracing intricate lines in the dirt with her staff. The others gathered closer, their breaths quiet, watching as the transmutation circle took shape under Catherine’s careful guidance. The forest seemed to hold its breath, the hum of its magic vibrating faintly in their bones.
The circle glowed faintly, reacting to the proximity of the Eden Flowers. Torrie whispered, &quot;Is it working?&quot;
Catherine glanced up, her silver hair shimmering in the firelight. &quot;It will. Just a little longer.&quot;
As she worked, Eddie felt a strange sense of calm settle over him, the light of the flame casting away the shadows both in the forest and within his own doubts.</Text>
            <Notes>journey to DEEP GLAIVE

Who wants what? Why can’t they have it

THE PARTY wants to get inside the forest, but as the forest name implies, it is illusory. They enters and it was as if they are on an ocean, as they enters, the roof closes in

What will they do?
THE PARTY needs a light, so Eddie uses Torrie’s wand to light a fire, its floating on the tip of her wand, he uses the gunpowder for fuel

Who cares? What if they don’t get it?



What is the good news?They got a source of light

What is the bad news?
They got lost

            <Title>Chapter 7E</Title>
            <Text>The library bustled with a nervous energy unlike anything Eddie had ever witnessed. Gone was the usual hush reserved for studying and quiet contemplation. Instead, a murmur of tense whispers filled the air, punctuated by the occasional choked sob or muttered curse. The room was a sea of faces, etched with worry, anger, and a desperate hope that mirrored his own.
Eddie, alongside Will and his bandmates, Jake and Jane , stood amidst this gathering storm. They had heeded Ashley's advice, transforming the library into their temporary headquarters. Henry and some of his friend from Automaton Engineering Faculty, who had finished with their automaton engineering project also joined, hearing of the news about the dissapearance of his  friend, he wanted to help. News of their mission, spread through the network of missing person posters, had drawn a diverse crowd. Eddie and Will, perched on a long table usually reserved for group projects, found themselves facing a sea of unfamiliar faces, Young students, their eyes red-rimmed from tears, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with older siblings, caretakers, and even a few weary-looking parents. They were all united by a single, burning desire: to bring their loved ones, like Madeleine, back home.
The weight of their expectations pressed heavily on Eddie. These people had placed their trust in him, a complete stranger, fueled by a single desperate broadcast. He scanned the room, his gaze lingering on the tear-streaked face of a young girl clutching a worn teddy bear, or the grizzled features of a man whose hardened eyes betrayed a deep well of grief.
And then the door of the library creaked open, revealing Claire, she is heading towards Eddie and Will
“Where is Ashley?” Asked Eddie his voice laced with a hint of urgency.
&quot;She's out getting someone,&quot; Claire explained, taking a seat at the long table they had commandeered. &quot;This is unexpected,&quot; she added, gesturing towards the growing crowd, “To see the library this lively at night.”
“Yeah, this is so many people,” Eddie said, “Far more than i initially thought,”
Will chuckled, a nervous sound. &quot;The more the merrier, I say. The Black Hand has a sizeable operation, we need all the help we can get.&quot;
After a while waiting, the front door of the library creaked once more, Eddie's brow furrowed as the library door creaked open, his gaze darting towards the entrance. Christine and Geralt entered, accompanied by Ashley, their presence a source of surprise and tension.
&quot;What are they doing here?&quot; Eddie muttered to Ashley as she joined him in the long table, his voice laced with suspicion as his eyes flickered between Christine and Geralt.
Ashley, ever the diplomat, stepped forward with a reassuring smile. &quot;They're here to help, Eddie,&quot; she explained. &quot;Christine and Geralt have also lost someone to these kidnappings.&quot;
Claire head snapped up, a flicker of recognition dawning on her face. &quot;You mean Dominic?&quot; she asked, her voice tinged with sympathy.
Christine's face hardened, her voice devoid of warmth as she replied, &quot;Yes, Dominic had gone missing a few days ago and we’ve been searching for him ever since. And unlike some people,&quot; her icy glare landed on Eddie for a brief moment, &quot;We're not content to sit around and do nothing.&quot;
Eddie's jaw clenched, his fists involuntarily balling up at his sides. &quot;You've got some nerve showing your face here, Christine,&quot; he growled, a dangerous edge creeping into his voice.
Geralt, sensing the rising tension, stepped forward quickly, placing himself between Christine and Eddie. &quot;Mind your tone, Welton,&quot; he warned, his voice firm but laced with a hint of understanding. &quot;Madeleine isn't the only one they've taken. We're all in this together now.&quot;
Ashley, ever the voice of reason, intervened before the situation could escalate further. &quot;Look, I know there's bad blood between you all,&quot; she said, her voice calm yet firm, &quot;but right now, we need to focus on finding our missing friends. The Black Hand doesn't discriminate – they've taken from all of us.&quot;
Will, after a moment of deliberation, nodded slowly in agreement. &quot;Ashley's right,&quot; he conceded, his voice heavy. &quot;We can't afford to let personal grudges get in the way. Madeleine, Dominic – they're all counting on us.&quot;
Christine gritted her teeth, the anger in her eyes battling with the desperation in her voice. &quot;Fine,&quot; she spat, the word laced with bitterness. &quot;But don't think this means we're suddenly friends, Welton.&quot;
Eddie returned her glare with a coldness that mirrored her own. &quot;Trust me, Christine, the feeling's mutual.&quot;
A heavy sigh escaped Ashley's lips. &quot;Can we please try to work together?&quot; she pleaded, her gaze sweeping over the tense group. &quot;We're stronger as a team. Divided, we fall. Together, maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to bring our friends back.&quot;
One by one, the others in the library shifted their attention towards the central long table, their hushed whispers fading. The air crackled with a newfound sense of purpose, the shared grief and determination overshadowing the personal conflicts. Together, they began to formulate their next move, a ragtag band of students united against a common enemy. The library, once a haven for quiet study, now hummed with the energy of a rebellion, the fate of their missing friends hanging in the balance.
Will nudged him, his voice a low murmur. &quot;Alright, Eddie,&quot; he said. &quot;Time to step up.&quot;
Eddie glancing around, “Who? me?” &quot;Of course, you, buddy!&quot; Will chuckled good-naturedly. &quot;You're the one who rallied this army. Now you gotta lead them.&quot;
Eddie's gaze darted around the room, taking in the expectant faces – young and old, etched with worry and a spark of defiance. He swallowed hard, the weight of their trust settling heavily on his shoulders. He had never considered himself a leader, and the thought of standing before this crowd, his voice cracking under pressure, sent a fresh wave of panic coursing through him.
Eddie stood up, he tries to opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out. His hands tremble, and he looks down at the floor, feeling the weight of everyone's expectations pressing down on him
Eddie goes back to his seat in the long table, stammering, “But I’m— I’m not good at this. I’ve never— I can’t—” Ashley steps forward, sensing his struggle. She gently takes Eddie’s hand in hers, her touch cold but reassuring. Her hand was cold, almost unnaturally so, yet through that coolness, He felt a pulse, a steady rhythm that echoed his own. There was a calmness in her touch, a grounding anchor in the storm of his nerves. He looks up, meeting her bright hazel eyes. Her gaze is steady and filled with unwavering belief in him
“It’s Alright, Eddie.” Ashley said softly, “We believe in you.”
They sat like that, hands clasped in each other's grasp, Minutes morphed into an eternity, punctuated only by the distant chatter in the sea of worry and grief for acts he no longer saw. In her hand, Eddie found a strength he hadn't known I possessed. He squeezes her hand back, drawing strength from her support. He takes a deep breath, his chest rising and falling as he tries to calm his racing heart. ”Alright. Here goes nothing.” Eddie muttered
Eddie took a deep breath, the air thick with anticipation. He raised his hand for silence, and the room gradually quieted. Hundreds of eyes turned towards him, a sea of hope and desperation washing over him.
&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; he began, his voice surprisingly steady despite the tremor running through his limbs. &quot;We're all here for the same reason – to find those the Black Hand has stolen from us.&quot;
He paused, letting his words sink in. A murmur of agreement rippled through the room. A young woman, her eyes red-rimmed from crying, stepped forward. &quot;My brother,&quot; she choked out, clutching a well-worn photo. &quot;He disappeared a month ago. No leads, no answers. The police… they just gave up.&quot;
A burly man with a shaved head nodded grimly. &quot;My sister. Brightest student in the academy. Gone without a trace. No one seems to care.&quot;
&quot;We may not know each other,&quot; Eddie continued, &quot;but we share a common enemy. The Black Hand has taken our loved ones, filled our lives with fear and pain. But we won't stand by and let them win!&quot;
A wave of determined energy surged through the room, a ripple effect starting with a single, hesitant nod and culminating in a chorus of fists clenching on the table. Christine, who had remained perched on the table with a skeptical frown etched on her face, found herself mirroring the action, a flicker of defiance replacing her doubt. The air crackled with a newfound electricity, the collective fear morphing into a shared purpose.
&quot;Mr. Jester, a contact of mine,&quot; he explained, &quot;has offered to help us strike back.”
Christine, her skepticism momentarily forgotten, leaned forward, her voice sharp. &quot;And what does he want in return?&quot;
Henry then also spoke up. &quot;Yeah, What do they want? they couldn’t just help us for free?&quot; His voice was laced with steely determination.
“He requires one thing,” Eddie continued, “An army. Not an army of soldiers, but an army of people united by a common cause. People like you and me, who refuse to let the Black Hand win.&quot;
&quot;They want us to strike back,&quot; Will said, laying it all bare. &quot;They want us to attack a Black Hand hideout, deep within the city's underbelly.&quot;
A collective gasp filled the room. The magnitude of the task settled upon them like a heavy cloak. This wasn't a protest, not a rally. This was a daring raid, a perilous mission that could thrust them all into the heart of danger.
Geralt's skepticism hung heavy in the air, a dampener on the burgeoning enthusiasm. &quot;And how do we know we can trust this contact of yours?&quot; he asked, his voice laced with suspicion.
Eddie, stung by the doubt but understanding its source, took a deep breath. &quot;We don't,&quot; he admitted, his voice firm despite the tremor in his hands. &quot;But right now, it's the only lead we have. We can't sit around and wait for the Black Hand to strike again. We need to take action, gather our own forces – people who understand what's at stake, people who have a stake in this fight.&quot;
Will leaned forward, his voice echoing Eddie's resolve. &quot;We need to be smart about this,&quot; he emphasized. &quot;We're not just looking for muscle; we need people with the same fire in their bellies, the same desperation. People who've lost loved ones to the Black Hand and won't rest until they're back.&quot;
Ashley chimed in, her voice a beacon of unwavering belief. &quot;And from what I've seen,&quot; she said, her gaze sweeping across the sea of anxious faces, &quot;there are more people affected by this than we realize. This campus alone is teeming with them. We just need to channel that collective grief, that shared anger, into something more.&quot;
Eddie scanned the room, searching for a flicker of doubt, a hint of hesitation. But instead, he saw only a sea of resolute faces, each one etched with a unique story of loss, yet all bound together by a common purpose.
Taking a deep breath to steady his own nerves, Eddie addressed the room once more. &quot;We know this is a big ask,&quot; he acknowledged, his voice resonating with sincerity. &quot;We know this is a dangerous path we're about to embark on. But we can't do this alone. Every single one of you has a reason to fight. They've taken your loved ones, your friends, your family. But they haven't taken your spirit. They haven't taken your fight!&quot;
Silence once again descended upon the room. The students exchanged glances, their faces a mixture of fear and resolve. Then, a small, determined voice broke the tension.
&quot;I'm in,&quot; a young woman declared, her voice trembling slightly but her eyes blazing with defiance. &quot;I won't let them get away with this.&quot;
A wave of relief washed over Eddie. One voice had become two, then three, then a chorus. Christine, her face stoic but a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes, finally spoke. &quot;Fine,&quot; she conceded, a grudging acceptance in her voice. &quot;But let's get one thing clear – this alliance ends when we get Dominic back.&quot;
Geralt echoed her sentiment with a curt nod. &quot;We're here for Dominic. Nothing more.&quot;
Will, his eyes gleaming with newfound hope, added, &quot;And for Madeleine. And for everyone else they've taken.&quot;
Ashley looking Eddie with a smile latent with pride said, “We can do this. We have to.”
One by one, others echoed her sentiment. A ripple of agreement spread through the room, gathering momentum with each voice that joined the chorus. The fear hadn't vanished, but it was overshadowed by a fierce determination, a collective will to fight for justice.
&quot;We won't promise it will be easy,&quot; Eddie continued, his voice ringing with conviction. &quot;There will be challenges, dangers… But we will face them together. Because giving up is not an option. Not when our loved ones are counting on us to bring them home!&quot;
A collective cheer erupted from the crowd, a raw, primal sound that resonated with the pain and anger festering within them. This wasn't just a gathering anymore; it was the birth of a resistance, fueled by love and loss. Eddie glanced at Will and his bandmates, their faces alight with determination. He spotted Ashley next to him, a small smile playing on her lips as she watched the scene unfold. They had a long road ahead, but for the first time since Madeleine's disappearance, a flicker of hope danced in his heart. They weren't alone. They had an army. And together, they would find Madeleine and dismantle the Black Hand, one way or another. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 15</Title>
            <Text>For the first time after Eddie entered the forest, he felt safer. The ground below crunch as he made through his way along the Traveller’s Path. Torrie and Markus was up ahead, marvelling the surroundings beyond the Traveller’s Path. They are at the heart of the Deep Glaive now, they are at the deep end, as Catherine puts it, it’s like the depth of the oceans, and it shows.
Catherine walks behind Torrie and Markus, but in front of Eddie, she doesn’t seem to be marvelled by the sight of the enormous forest, she just strolled through the Travellers Path as if it was a walk in the park.
As they walk deeper and deeper. The trees grew thicker and taller as they go. Their trunks now as thick as a castle’s tower, the barks gnarled and ancient. 
Eddie looked up, following the bark’s reach above, only to find that the clouds had swallowed them before it could reach the heavens.
The thick canopy above had completely sealed them from the skylight, ocassionally streams of moonlight passes through the heavy canopy, only to be swallowed by the darkness below.
“Alright, folks. We will be stopping here.” Catherine said, stretching her arms, &quot;We should arrive at the Heart of the Deep Glaive—the deepest, most ancient part of the Illusory Forest itself. We can rest here for now.&quot;
“Yay!” Torrie exclaimed, “Can I go exploring now, Aunt Catherine?”
“You may,” Catherine said, “But don’t go over the Eden Flowers, Torrie. You don’t want to be snatced up by whatever creatures in here don’t you?”
Torrie nodded then went off.
“You too can go on explore too, you know?” Catherine glanced to Eddie and Markus with a teasing expression, “Adventures are not just for sightseeing.”
Eddie and Markus exchanged a glance 
“Alright then,” Eddie said, “Let’s go Mark, maybe we can get something for the apothecary.”
Eddie and Markus then off wandering, keeping close enough to stay within sight of the glowing Eden Flowers. They marveled at the unique vegetation that thrived on the massive tree trunks.
Vivid green mosses with faint silver veins, delicate flowers that shimmered with an iridescent glow, and clusters of mushrooms that emitted soft blue light.
&quot;Whoa… this is incredible…&quot; Eddie said to himself. &quot;These are Everglow Mushrooms. And that moss… it’s Silverweave. These are rare—used for potent healing potions and wounds regenerations.&quot;
Markus then leaned closer. &quot;You’re right, this is worth a fortune.&quot;
“Catherine?” Eddie called, “Can we pick these? Please tell me we can pick these.&quot;
Catherine though, seemed distracted, she is looking at the paths ahead, then to the dark abyss on the sides, as if looking for something.
“Catherine?”
“Yeah?” Catherine jolted
“I was asking whether can we pick the plants here, just making sure it’s not cursed or something.”
“Of course not, it’s not cursed,” Catherine chuckled, “Take as much as you like! As long as it’s withing the paths of course, just don’t stray over it.”
That was all the confirmation Eddie needed. He and Markus began carefully gathering the rare ingredients, their earlier fatigue forgotten in their excitement.
As Eddie and Markus gathered ingredients, Torrie sat cross-legged on the side of the path, her attention captured by the Eden Flowers. She carefully plucked a few blooms, weaving them together into a delicate crown. The golden light of the flowers reflected onto her face as she placed the crown on her head.
&quot;How do I look?&quot; she asked, turning to show Eddie, and Markus.
Markus chuckled. &quot;Like a queen of the forest.&quot;
&quot;Don’t let it go to your head, Torrie.&quot; Eddie added, “The queen shall never let go of her crown!”
Torrie responded with a laugh, The party seemed to relax for the first time since their journey began. The forest, once so foreboding, now felt welcoming, even protective. 
For now, all seemed well.
After filling their satchels with rare Ingredients, Eddie and Markus settled back to the Traveller’s Path, joining Torrie. 
When Eddie and Markus joined her at the side of the Traveller’s Path, Torrie puts two of the Eden Flower crowns on top of Markus and Eddie, he could see to that Catherine also had one in her head, and Torrie didn’t seem to be stopping making the crowns.
“And now I shall pronounce you King of the Deep Glaive!” Torrie said with a fluorish.
“Don’t you hear that, Ed? We’re kings now!” Markus joked.
“A kingdom doesn’t have two kings, Torrie.” Eddie said back, “If me and Markus are Kings, and you are the Queen, that what you make of Catherine then?”
Torrie then stopped and thinks, and then her face lit up with mischief.
“Aunt Catherine would be the irresponsible Princess!”
Eddie and Markus then brust into a laugh, The air seemed to lighten.
Eddie’s gaze lingered on Catherine thinking she would make some sort of witty response to Torrie’s joke, it is weird that she seemed very occupied. She stood apart from the group, her hand clutching something—a map, Eddie realized her frustated expression.
Shouldn’t she be pleased? Happy? The fact that they made it safely to the heart of the Deep Glaive? They conquered the Illusort, afterall. Shouldn’t that be a reason to be happy in this scenario?
But then suddenly… Eddie remembered something…
It hit him like a blast of cold air. The conversation they’d had a few nights ago, outside the Swordfish Pub, rushed back to him.
She isn’t here for rare ingredients.
She isn’t here for adventures.
She is here for an ancient artefact.
Eddie swallowed, watching her as she folded the map, the parchment old and weathered, its edges frayed and stained with dirt. She folded it, then unfolded it again and again, once in a while looking over the abyss beyond the Traveller’s Path.
Catherine then walked to the edge of the Traveller’s Path just next to Eddie. Her gaze was overlooking the abyss in front of her, the seeming darkness that enveloped the Illusory forest, as if searching something beyond its darkness.
Looking at her, Eddie stood up and looked to the direction Catherine is gazing.
“Catherine?…” Eddie began, “You alright? You seemed really occupied.”
“We didn’t arrive where I thought we would…” Catherine said almost whispering, “We were off a couple metres… this can’t be good.”
&quot;What do you mean?” Eddie frowned, glancing at the map. “We are at the Heart of the Deep Glaive isn’t it? Isn’t this… where you wanted to be?&quot;
Catherine lets out a frustrated sigh. She tapped a spot on the map, near a series of intricate symbols. &quot;The Traveler’s Path doesn’t lead directly to the ruins I was hoping to explore. 
“I thought it might cross through, but… it doesn’t.&quot; Catherine continued, turning her gaze toward the abyss beyond the glowing Eden Flowers. &quot;The ruins are only a few meters off the path. Not far.&quot;
“I’m going over.”
Eddie stared at her, his pupils dilating in panic, did he heard her correctly? Didn’t she just said a few moments ago to Not go beyond the safety of the Eden Flowers? Is this the same person who just gave that advice?
“Catherine…” Eddie said, his eyes piercing towards Catherine, “Are you fucking crazy?”</Text>
            <Notes>What do they want? And why can’t they have it?

They already got what they want, that is they are already in the heart of the deep glaiveBut, Catherine is still not statisfied, turns out the paths did not cross where the Artefacts will be, so she wants to get it over the Traveller’s path

Why do we care? What if they don’t get itCatherine cannot leave without the Artefact, they are alredy this deep, and the party certaintly cannot ditch her

What are the good news?

Markus and Eddie found rare ingredients for the Apothecary, Torrie found her liking for Eden Flowers.What are the bad news?

Catherine is determined to seek the Artefact, that means, going over the paths</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 14E</Title>
            <Text>A low, rhythmic beeping and the gentle hum of an air conditioner struggling against the tropical heat were the first things to pierce the darkness. Eddie stirred, a deep groan escaping his lips as a dull, comprehensive ache settled into his bones. He blinked, once, twice, trying to force the world into focus.
The light was bright, filtering in through the slatted blinds of a large window, painting stripes across a clean, tiled floor. This wasn't his dorm room. The sterile smell of antiseptic confirmed it. A hospital.
It took a while for his eyes to adjust, and then he noticed a figure standing by the window, hands clasped behind his back, looking out over the bustling city below. The silhouette was sharp, familiar, and impeccably dressed.
&quot;Professor?&quot; Eddie asked, his voice a dry, raspy whisper.
Professor Gareth Hudson turned his head, his silver hair catching the morning light. &quot;Finally awake, have you?&quot; His tone was as cold and precise as ever, though perhaps this time, the sharpest edges had been blunted by a hint of warmth. &quot;You took some beating yesterday. You're lucky you're even back alive.&quot;
Guilt, heavy and immediate, settled in Eddie's stomach. He struggled to push himself into a sitting position, the movement sending a fresh wave of pain through his ribs. &quot;I... I suppose I owe you an apology, Professor.&quot;
&quot;Hm?&quot; Hudson turned fully to face him, one eyebrow raised in feigned curiosity. &quot;What for?&quot;
Eddie looked down at the thin hospital blanket covering his lap, unable to meet the man's intense gaze. &quot;For assuming that you... for thinking you were the one who kidnapped Madeleine,&quot; he said, the words tasting like ash. &quot;I know I misjudged. Badly.&quot;
A moment of silence passed. Then, to Eddie's utter astonishment, Professor Hudson laughed. It wasn't a loud laugh, but a dry, rare chuckle that seemed to surprise even him.
&quot;The only time I have ever 'kidnapped' Mrs. Daedallia, Welton, is when I've required her assistance at the Sanctuary to study a particularly stubborn species of moon orchid,&quot; he said, a faint, wry smirk touching his lips. &quot;Otherwise, yes. It was a foolish misjudgment on your end.&quot;
Eddie managed a weak chuckle, the effort sending a dull ache through his ribs. It felt important to acknowledge the Professor's attempt at humour, a small gesture to bridge the gap his accusations had created. The faint smile faded as his expression turned serious again. &quot;Can I ask you something, Professor?&quot;
&quot;If this is to clear more of your 'misjudgments,' then go ahead,&quot; Hudson replied, his tone returning to its usual dryness. &quot;You're free to speak, Welton.&quot;
&quot;What were you doing back there?&quot; Eddie asked, his voice quiet but direct, referring to the chaos of the previous night. &quot;At the pet shop. It couldn't be that you were also aware of Madeleine's disappearance, could it?&quot;
Professor Hudson didn't answer right away. He turned from the bed and walked back to the window, his posture rigid as he stared out at the sprawling, sun-baked city. For a moment, the sharp, authoritative lines of his face seemed to soften, collapsing inward under the weight of an unseen, profound burden. A flicker of raw grief, so quick Eddie almost missed it, crossed his features before being locked away again behind a mask of stoicism.
&quot;Something is brewing in this country, Edward Welton,&quot; Professor Hudson said at last, his voice low, his gaze still fixed on the horizon. 
&quot;A sickness, slowly spreading, infecting anyone to whom it made contact with. And your friend, Mr. Schroder, was a symptom of it.&quot; He turned his head slightly, his eyes finding Eddie's in the reflection on the glass. &quot;You need to choose your allies more carefully in the future. Sometimes the best ally is not the kindest. And sometimes, the sweetest and most caring of individuals have the potential of stabbing one in the back.&quot;
Eddie sat there in silence, the truth of Hudson's words a heavy weight in the quiet room.
Hudson then turned fully, his expression unreadable. &quot;Take your other friends, for example. Mr. Chester and Ms. Mayfair.&quot; He paused. &quot;I've heard the rumors, of course. The three of you in the restricted section of the library after midnight. An act that can, and should, grant anyone involved an immediate expulsion from Edenfield.&quot;
He took a step closer to the bed. &quot;The organization we dismantled last night... they are not just rogue academics, Welton. They are human traffickers, kidnappers, extortionists. The most dangerous elements in this city. A dragon's den. And yet, when you decided to walk into it, Mr. Chester and Ms. Mayfair followed you without question.&quot;
Hudson looked down at Eddie, his gaze intense, a flicker of something that might have been respect in his cold eyes.
&quot;You have great allies, Mr. Welton. Cultivate their trust, and they will protect you for as long as they can. As you will also do for them.&quot;
Eddie sat there in the quiet, the weight of Professor Hudson's words settling upon him. He thought of Walther's cold smirk and Will's steady presence, of the conspiracy brewing in the shadows and the unshakable loyalty of the friends who had walked into hell with him.
His reflection was interrupted by a commotion down the polished linoleum hall. A woman's voice, sharp and insistent, with a familiar Kiwi accent, was growing louder.
&quot;I don't care if visiting hours are technically over! He's our friend! We just need to see if he's awake!&quot;
That was definitely Ashley. Her voice was followed by the calmer, placating American tones of Will trying to mediate with a nurse. &quot;Ash, easy... Ma'am, we'll just be five minutes, I promise. We brought snacks.&quot;
A rare, genuine smile touched Professor Hudson's lips. As if on cue, he straightened his overcoat, his business concluded. &quot;Well, it seems my time is up. Goodbye, Mr. Welton. And good luck.&quot; He walked towards the door, pausing just before he left.
&quot;And for the record,&quot; he added, his tone returning to its usual deadpan seriousness, &quot;final terms are in two weeks. 'Dismantling a rogue trafficking organization' will not earn you an automatic pass.&quot; He let that sink in for a moment. &quot;However... I suppose I could be persuaded to add three points to your final test scores. For... 'exceptional field research'.&quot;
For Professor Hudson, it was the most generous offer he'd likely made all year.
He swept out of the room just as Will and Ashley finally won their battle with the nursing staff. They rushed in, their faces etched with a frantic worry that melted into visible relief upon seeing him awake.
&quot;Eddie! You're awake!&quot; Ashley breathed, her usual composure frayed at the edges.
Will followed her in, looking equally exhausted but managing a weak grin. &quot;Dude. You look like hell.&quot;
Eddie let out a raspy chuckle, the sound catching in his sore throat. &quot;Relax. You know, I've had worse.&quot;
&quot;Will, don't say that!&quot; Ashley scolded, lightly smacking his arm before turning her worried gaze back to Eddie. &quot;How are you feeling, really?&quot;
&quot;Like I got kicked through a door and fell down a flight of stairs,&quot; Eddie admitted, a wry smile touching his lips. &quot;But I'll live.&quot;
As Ashley started meticulously arranging the pastries from the box onto a hospital tray and Will cracked open a cold bottle for him, Eddie just watched them. He watched the easy, familiar way they moved around each other, the unspoken rhythm of their friendship filling the sterile room with a warmth that no amount of tropical sun outside ever could. A profound sense of gratitude, so strong it almost hurt, washed over him.
He remembered, then, how utterly impossible it all was. Will and Ashley had been his closest friends, his only real friends, since he'd arrived in Edenfield. They had come just as far from their homes as he had, from worlds he couldn't even imagine. He had never seen the endless, sprawling maze of London, the city that had shaped Will's sharp wit and unshakeable confidence. He had never felt the humid, subtropical heat of a Brisbane summer that lived in Ashley's pragmatic, sunny disposition. He was just a boy from a dying town in Oregon, a place that smelled of wet pine and quiet desperation.
But here, by some sheer, miraculous chance of fate, the three of them had been drawn from completely different corners of the world to this mystical city in the heart of Solivia. A boy from America, a boy from England, and a girl from Australia. They had met, and in the strange, magical air of Edenfield, they had become best friends, a family forged not by blood, but by choice.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 29 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The moonlight filtered in through the high stained-glass hospital window, casting a pale, silver glow across the room. The soft rustling of the night breeze was the only sound, yet Eddie couldn't sleep. He lay on his back. He stared up at the ceiling, the quiet hours of the night stretching out before him like an endless expanse.
The card Catherine had given him rested on his chest. Its brass surface was calm and weighty beneath his fingers. The owl sigil of the Sage's Institute gleamed faintly in the moonlight. Beneath it, Catherine's name and title—Master Alchemist—stood in sharp contrast to the softness of the room.
Eddie turned the card over, tracing the edges with his thumb. Its weight felt symbolic as if it were more than just a gift. A decision was waiting, a door standing wide open before him.
He had always wanted this—Alchemy, the pursuit of magic in its purest form. It had been his passion, his purpose back at Aella Academy, and now, it was within reach. But doubts crept in. He was no longer the same person he had been back then. He wasn't the golden student of the class. He had fallen, been expelled, and now he was just… stuck.
A deep sigh escaped him. His mind raced, replaying everything that had happened. Catherine's words, the moment they'd shared earlier in the courtyard. Davies's encouragement still ringing in his ears:
&quot;If you're considering continuing to university, choose Alchemy! You've got a real knack for it!&quot;
Davies, of all people. The same guy he thought would never forgive him, who now had reminded him of the very thing he had buried deep inside. His talent. His potential. What if he didn't pursue this? What if he let this chance slip away like all the others? Would he ever get another one?
Eddie closed his eyes and breathed deeply, trying to calm his racing thoughts. It's not too late, he told himself. I don't have to keep running away from what I really want.
He opened his eyes and stared at the card again. The sigil glowed faintly as though it were waiting for him to make his choice. It was as if the universe had placed this opportunity in his path, and now it was his turn to decide if he would take it.
The thought of walking into Sage's Institute. Of knocking on that front door in the heart of Central Weshaven. It filled him with a mixture of excitement and fear. But then, a sense of resolve settled over him.
When I get better, Eddie thought, I will go. I'll knock on that door and tell them I'm ready. I'll make my way to Edenfield University. I'll pursue Alchemy for real.
With the decision, Eddie felt a shift, a quiet sense of purpose taking root. His hand tightened around the brass card, his thumb retracing the edges.
He would do it. He would become the Alchemist he was meant to be. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 8E</Title>
            <Text>As the first fingers of dawn crept through the city's dense fog, a sliver of light sliced through the grimy window of Mr. Jester's apartment. Inside, the space served a dual purpose: a sanctuary for sleep and a war room for relentless pursuit of truth. Countless hours of investigation and writing had been waged within these walls, leaving their mark on the overflowing bookshelves and stacks of papers.
Mr. Jester, an indie crime journalist renowned for his relentless pursuit of truth, was already at his desk. The rhythmic clack of the typewriter keys mingled with the faint hum of the city awakening outside. His brow furrowed in concentration, eyes scanning a page from a handwritten notebook before translating his thoughts onto the crisp white sheet of paper. A steaming mug of black coffee, its aroma a potent lure, sat within arm's reach – a faithful companion for these early morning hours. His glasses perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, and a pen rested behind his ear, poised for swift notes or corrections.
In these quiet, pre-dawn hours, the world around Mr. Jester faded away. He was completely absorbed in his writing routine, fingers flying over the typewriter keys with practiced ease. The rhythmic tapping became a soothing soundtrack to his thoughts, each keystroke bringing him closer to unraveling another piece of the truth.
&quot;Just a few more lines, and I'll have this done…&quot; he muttered to himself, lost in the flow of his words.
His reverie was shattered by a jarring ring at the door. Mr. Jester sighed, the sound heavy with exasperation. &quot;Who could it be this early?&quot; he grumbled, pushing himself away from the desk and shuffling towards the front door.
Unbolting the locks, he cracked the door open to find three figures standing on the other side. Will, instantly recognizable, stood front and center, flanked by Jake and Jane, the twins, their mischievous grins unmistakable.
&quot;Hey, we're Eddie's friends,&quot; Will announced, his voice booming through the narrow entryway. &quot;He said to meet someone called Oswald Jester in this room.&quot;
Mr. Jester, momentarily taken aback, raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes, that's me,&quot; he finally acknowledged, his voice laced with a hint of amusement. &quot;Though, calling my apartment this grand of a 'room' might be a bit of a stretch.&quot;
A burst of laughter erupted from behind Will. Jake and Jane, never one to miss an opportunity for a playful jab, chimed in. &quot;Edward's Army reporting for duty! Sir!&quot;
Will joined in the laughter, the tension easing from his shoulders. Mr. Jester, despite himself, couldn't help but crack a slight smile. &quot;Very funny,&quot; he conceded, stepping aside to allow them entrance. &quot;Wait in the middle room. I'm still finishing up an article.&quot;
Will, Jake, and Jane exchanged amused glances before filing into the designated room, their earlier apprehension replaced by a sense of camaraderie. Mr. Jester, left alone with the rhythmic clicking of his typewriter once more, attempted to refocus on his article. But the echoes of their laughter lingered, a reminder of the task at hand and the unexpected army that now stood beside him.
A few minutes passed, the rhythmic clack of the typewriter a lonely sound in the now-quiet apartment. Just as Mr. Jester felt a sliver of focus returning, another jarring ring shattered the fragile peace.
&quot;This better be important,&quot; he muttered under his breath, his earlier frustration bubbling back up.
He trudged to the door again, flinging it open with a sigh. This time, three familiar faces greeted him – Henry, Claire, and Madeleine, a small army of their own in tow.
&quot;Hey, we're Eddie's friends,&quot; Henry announced, his voice carrying a hint of sheepishness. &quot;Can we come in?&quot;
Madeleine, ever the diplomat, stepped forward, a warm smile on her face. &quot;We also bring some snacks for you and the others,&quot; she added. &quot;My parents baked some cookies yesterday! They were practically begging me to bring some.&quot;
Mr. Jester pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to tamp down the surge of exasperation. &quot;Oh, feel free,&quot; he sighed, stepping aside to allow them entrance. &quot;Join the others in the middle room. And please,&quot; he added, a hint of pleading in his voice, &quot;keep it down alright?&quot;
&quot;Okay!&quot; Madeleine chimed, relief washing over her features. With a nod, Henry, Claire, and Madeleine filed inside, their group merging with Will's. The low murmur of conversation that had subsided earlier rose in volume once more, punctuated by the crinkling of cellophane and the tempting aroma of freshly baked cookies.
Mr. Jester sank back into his chair, the typewriter keys mocking him with their silence. Refocusing on his article felt like an impossible feat. The chaotic energy of the growing army seeped into his workspace, a stark contrast to the solitude he usually craved.
The rhythmic clack of the typewriter resumed, a valiant attempt to reclaim the battlefield of Mr. Jester's focus. Each keystroke was a soldier pushing back against the tide of interruptions. But just as a semblance of order began to re-establish itself, the doorbell, that insistent harbinger of chaos, rang once more.
Mr. Jester's face contorted in a grimace. His brow furrowed so deeply it threatened to become a permanent resident of his forehead. With a sigh that spoke volumes of his frustration, he pushed himself away from the desk and marched towards the door, each step heavy with resignation.
He yanked the door open, his patience hanging by a thread. Before him stood Christine and Geralt, an unlikely pair united by their shared purpose. Christine, ever the picture of propriety, wrinkled her nose at the faint scent of stale tobacco and hops that wafted out from the apartment.
&quot;Is this the right place?&quot; she scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. &quot;It smells like…&quot; she paused, searching for a particularly scathing word, &quot;…like a bachelor pad that hasn't seen cleaning supplies in a decade.&quot;
Mr. Jester, on the verge of exploding, simply reached his limit. He threw his hands up in exasperation. &quot;Yes, it's the right place!&quot; he barked. &quot;Middle room, with the rest. Now if you'll excuse me…&quot;
Christine, momentarily taken aback by his outburst, simply grunted in response and swept past him, Geralt trailing behind with a stoic expression. The door slammed shut behind them, adding another layer to the symphony of noise emanating from the middle room. Mr. Jester, defeated, returned to his desk. The frustration was etched on his face, a stark contrast to the blank page staring back at him.
Mr. Jester slammed his fist onto the desk, the impact rattling the typewriter and sending a jolt through his already frayed nerves. &quot;Just a few more minutes of peace,&quot; he growled, his voice hoarse with frustration. &quot;That's all I ask, dear gods of the arcane, just a few more minutes to finish this damn article!&quot;
As if in mockery, the doorbell pierced the tense silence with a shrill ring. Mr. Jester lurched to his feet, his chair tumbling backward with a crash. Coffee cup in hand, he stormed towards the door, the scalding liquid threatening to spill over.
He flung the door open, the snarl on his face rivaling a cornered badger's. But before he could unleash a torrent of frustration, the words died in his throat. There, on his doorstep, stood Eddie, a look of sheepish apology plastered on his face. But Eddie wasn't alone. Flanking him was a sea of faces, a throng of students, parents, and concerned citizens – all united by the cruel hand of the Black Hand. A flicker of recognition sparked in Mr. Jester's eyes as he spotted Alfred and Corporal Gareth, both dressed in inconspicuous civilian clothing, standing discreetly behind Eddie.
&quot;Oh look,&quot; Mr. Jester deadpanned, his voice laced with a hint of dry humor, &quot;if it isn't the commander of the Edward Welton army himself. Come in, come in, the more the merrier…&quot;
Eddie shifted his weight awkwardly under the journalist's gaze. &quot;Uh, thanks, Mr. Jester,&quot; he mumbled, ushering the crowd past the threshold.
The once-quiet apartment was now overflowing with a cacophony of sound – hushed conversations punctuated by sniffles and the shuffling of feet. Mr. Jester watched with a mixture of exasperation and begrudging admiration as the room filled to the brim. He closed the door with a soft thud, the sound barely audible over the growing din. Glancing down at his now-cold coffee staining the floor, he let out a defeated sigh.
&quot;So much for a quiet morning,&quot; he muttered to himself, the weariness evident in his voice.
Despite his frustration, a small, unexpected smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. As he surveyed the determined faces, the burning embers of hope in their eyes, a warmth bloomed in his chest. This wasn't just chaos; it was the spark of a rebellion, a testament to the unwavering spirit in the face of adversity. Mr. Jester straightened his shoulders, a newfound resolve settling in his gut. With a resolute nod, he turned back to his desk, the cacophony around him no longer a distraction, but a battle cry. He had a plan to finalize, and an army to lead.
-o-
The air crackled with a nervous energy that buzzed beneath the surface of grim determination. The golden light of dawn spilled through the partially open curtains, casting an uneven glow over the room. The outside world, with its usual cacophony, seemed miles away, its noise muffled by the walls that now served as a war room.
Mr. Jester's desk, usually a haven for his investigative endeavors, had been transformed into the heart of their operation. The clutter of personal projects had been replaced by a sprawling map of the city, illuminated by a harsh desk lamp. The once-crisp surface was now a battlefield of tactics; photographs of the missing, their hopeful smiles replaced by a stark urgency, lay scattered alongside police reports and hastily scribbled notes. A vintage notebook, its pages yellowed with age and filled with Mr. Jester's spidery handwriting, lay open, offering a glimpse into his years of relentless pursuit of the Black Hand.
One entire wall had been commandeered to serve a different kind of purpose. A large corkboard, adorned with a haphazard tapestry of clues, dominated the space. Pictures of the missing, some recent, some faded with worry, held prominent positions. Red yarn, a stark symbol of danger, connected them, weaving a chilling narrative of abduction. Notes scribbled on scraps of paper offered details: last seen, last heard, any leads, however insignificant. A timeline of events, meticulously drawn in blue ink, provided a grim roadmap of their disappearance.
Eddie, his voice echoing with a newfound gravitas, stood in the center of the room, addressing the assembled crowd. &quot;Everyone, this is Mr. Oswald Jester, the journalist I told you about. He's been digging into the Black Hand for years. And this,&quot; he gestured towards a tall man in relaxed civilian clothing, &quot;is my brother, 2nd Lieutenant Alfred Welton of the Argantheian Airforce. He's here to help us plan.&quot;
Mr. Jester, his gaze serious behind the thick lenses of his glasses, offered both the students and the soldiers a curt nod of acknowledgment. A flicker of something akin to respect, perhaps even gratitude, passed through the room.
&quot;Thank you, Mr. Welton,&quot; Mr. Jester said, his voice gruff but laced with a newfound urgency. &quot;Let's get to work.&quot;
Mr. Jester tapped a calloused finger against a photo pinned to the corkboard – a chilling black and white crest depicting a skull leering from behind a grasping black hand. &quot;As you're all likely aware,&quot; he began, his voice raspy with exhaustion but firm with resolve, &quot;we're dealing with the Ancient Order of the Black Hand.&quot;
A murmur rippled through the room, laced with a mixture of fear and grim recognition. Some faces, particularly the students, held a blank confusion that Alfred, standing beside Mr. Jester, made a mental note to address later.
&quot;The Black Hand,&quot; Mr. Jester continued, his gaze sweeping across the room, &quot;has a long and twisted history. Once a legitimate political party in Solivia, they advocated for unrestricted magical use, a philosophy that clashed violently with established laws and societal norms. A decade ago, their controversial practices led to their official disbandment. But,&quot; he leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, &quot;like a weed with tenacious roots, they've burrowed underground.&quot;
&quot;Operating in the shadows,&quot; Alfred interjected, picking up the thread, &quot;they've likely become a rogue organization, experimenting with forbidden magic and employing thugs like the ones you suspect took your friends, Will.&quot;
Will, his jaw clenched tight, mumbled a grim confirmation. &quot;So, mercenaries for these Black Hand goons. But where the hell are they taking them?&quot;
Mr. Jester straightened, his eyes flashing with a spark of something akin to rage. &quot;The kidnappings. Prominent in Archaea, it seems, but with tendrils reaching out to other major cities, including Edenfield. Their victims? Public figures, powerful magic users, or those who possess a coveted magical lineage, like your friend, Eddie.&quot;
Eddie's hand instinctively tightened around a worn photograph tucked in his pocket – Ashley, her bright smile a stark contrast to the grim reality of her disappearance. &quot;She came from a long line of witches,&quot; he confirmed, his voice thick with emotion. &quot;A campus activist, outspoken against injustice. Exactly the kind of target they'd go for.&quot;
Geralt, his face etched with worry, chimed in, &quot;Dominic too. Always digging into conspiracies, questioning authority. He fit their profile as well.&quot;
Mr. Jester nodded grimly. &quot;Indeed. My investigation, aided by some…unorthodox methods,&quot; he shot a pointed look at Alfred, who smirked in response, &quot;has uncovered a pattern. Traces of magical residue, dismissed as unrelated incidents, all lead to a single location – secret entrances into Archaea's Undercity.&quot;
A collective gasp filled the room. Christine, her eyes wide with disbelief, finally found her voice. &quot;The Undercity? You can't be serious!&quot;
Mr. Jester met her gaze head-on, a steely glint in his eyes. &quot;Serious as a heart attack, Ms. Jones. The Black Hand operates from a hidden base deep within its labyrinthine tunnels. They wear black hooded cloaks and iron masks – a mockery of Queen Isobel III, a final insult to the very monarchy that ostracized them.&quot; A grim smile played on his lips. &quot;Seems they haven't forgotten their past, have they?&quot;
He gestured towards a map of Archaea sprawled across the desk, a red circle marking a specific location. &quot;This,&quot; he declared, his voice ringing with a newfound purpose, &quot;is where we'll find them. This is where we'll find your loved ones.&quot;
Mr. Jester stepped back, a silent invitation for Alfred to take center stage. The journalist had laid the groundwork, painting a chilling picture of the enemy and their motives. Now, it was time for the soldier to step forward, to unveil the strategy they had been meticulously crafting.
&quot;Second Lieutenant Welton and I have been working on this investigation on and off, collaborating with his colleagues in the Argantheian military,&quot; Mr. Jester explained, gesturing towards Alfred. &quot;We've been discussing this for months, piecing together everything we could about the Black Hand and their potential hideout.&quot;
A sense of grim determination settled over the room as Mr. Jester acknowledged their joint effort. The weight of the situation, the potential dangers, hung heavy in the air.
Alfred strode forward, his military bearing evident despite his casual clothing. A confident smile played on his lips, a stark contrast to the worry etched on many faces around him.
&quot;Mr. Jester, if you please,&quot; he began, his voice surprisingly light considering the circumstances. &quot;Call me Alfred, everyone. Mr. Jester, I'm not used to being called by my rank outside the base.&quot; A hint of sheepishness colored his grin.
Mr. Jester chuckled, the sound a welcome break in the tension. &quot;Now, now,&quot; he said, clapping Alfred on the shoulder. &quot;No need to be so humble, Lieutenant. Go on, explain your grand plan!&quot;
Alfred cleared his throat, his amusement fading as he addressed the group. &quot;Alright then,&quot; he said, his voice turning serious. &quot;Based on Mr. Jester's intel and our own recon, we've identified key locations within the Undercity. Our plan is to infiltrate these spots simultaneously, a multi-pronged attack that will effectively cut off any escape routes for the Black Hand and free the captives.&quot;
He gestured towards the map sprawled across the desk, the red circle now pulsing with a new significance. &quot;This operation hinges on precision and coordination,&quot; he emphasized, his gaze sweeping across the room. &quot;This isn't just about brute force; it's about strategy. There are a few crucial things you all need to understand before we delve into the specifics of this mission.&quot;
The once cluttered desk had been transformed into a command center. A large map, procured through Mr. Jester's extensive network, dominated the surface. Pushpins of various colors marked key locations within the sprawling labyrinth of the Undercity, while detailed sketches and photographs offered a glimpse into the bowels of the Black Hand's presumed headquarters. Alfred, his voice infused with a newfound authority that surprised even Eddie, stood tall at the head of the makeshift table.
&quot;Alright, everyone, gather around!&quot; he boomed, his voice echoing in the tense silence of the room. This wasn't the soft, hesitant Alfred of their previous encounters; this was a soldier, a leader honed by years of military discipline.
With a flourish, he gestured towards the map. &quot;This,&quot; he declared, his pen tapping a designated spot, &quot;is the heart of the Black Hand's operation, their hidden lair deep within the Undercity. What we're about to embark on is a Raid Operation, a meticulously planned strike with a clear objective: to neutralize the enemy and liberate our captured loved ones.&quot;
His gaze swept across the room, meeting each pair of eyes with unwavering determination. &quot;This mission will be conducted in five distinct stages,&quot; he explained, his voice firm and clear. &quot;Each stage is crucial, a cog in the well-oiled machine that will lead us to victory.&quot;
He pointed to the first section of the map, his pen tracing a path towards the designated target. &quot;Stage one: Infiltration. We will approach the Black Hand's headquarters using routes that minimize detection. Stealth will be our greatest weapon. Cloaks and muted attire will be essential for this phase.&quot;
A sense of grim understanding settled over the room. They were no longer students, activists, or grieving families; they were a unit, bound by a shared purpose.
Alfred continued, his voice rising in intensity with each stage. &quot;Stage two: Isolation. We will establish a perimeter around the target zone, effectively cutting off any escape routes for the Black Hand or reinforcements. Disrupting their communication lines will be paramount, sowing confusion and hindering their ability to coordinate a defense.&quot;
His pen moved to a different section of the map, highlighting strategic positions. &quot;Stage three: Preparation. This is where our specialists come into play. Illusionists will create diversions, while destruction and alteration mages will be positioned to provide cover fire or manipulate the environment to our advantage.&quot;
A flicker of nervous excitement passed through the group. The students, many of whom possessed latent magical abilities, straightened in their seats, eager to contribute their unique skills to the mission.
&quot;Stage four: Assault. The main strike force will breach the enemy's defenses,&quot; Alfred declared, his voice resonating with a steely resolve. &quot;We will move swiftly, silently taking down any hostiles and securing the captives.&quot;
A collective breath was held as the weight of the final stage settled in.
&quot;Stage five: Extraction. With the captives secured, we retreat from the Undercity using pre-designated escape routes. This will be a critical stage, requiring unwavering focus and discipline to avoid the Black Hand's inevitable pursuit. The outskirts of Archaea will serve as our rendezvous point, a safe haven where we can regroup and ensure the safety of our rescued loved ones.&quot;
Alfred scanned the faces around him, searching for any sign of doubt or hesitation. But all he saw were eyes reflecting a steely determination, a mirror of his own. &quot;These stages are a framework,&quot; he explained, &quot;a roadmap to guide our actions. But remember, the battlefield is fluid. We must adapt to the situation as it unfolds, prioritizing the success of the mission and the safety of our team. Any questions?&quot;
Silence reigned. The weight of the plan, the risks involved, hung heavy in the air. But amidst the tension, a flicker of hope ignited. They were no longer a ragtag group; they were a raiding force, a band of heroes united in their quest for justice.
Alfred's gaze swept across the room, meeting each hesitant nod and determined expression. The silence was a testament to the gravity of the situation, the weight of the plan settling on their shoulders. But it wasn't fear that dominated the air, it was resolve. They were no longer civilians, but a team, a band of misfits united by a common purpose.
Seeing no immediate questions, Alfred pressed on, outlining the specific roles within the operation. &quot;To ensure a smooth operation,&quot; he declared, &quot;we'll be divided into five specialized elements, each crucial to our success.&quot;
A wave of hands shot up from the back of the room. It was Jake and Jane, the twins Will knew from his band days. Their streetwise demeanor instantly made them perfect candidates for the task.
&quot;We can handle recon,&quot; Jake announced, his voice laced with a confidence that belied the danger of their assignment. &quot;We know the underbelly of Archaea like the back of our hands. Getting in and out unseen? That's our specialty,&quot; he added with a wink towards his sister.
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jane chimed in, a mischievous glint in her eyes, &quot;cheap booze has its perks, wouldn't you say, Jake?&quot;
Alfred, recognizing their potential, offered a curt nod. &quot;Excellent. Jake and Jane, you'll be our recon team. Your job is to scout ahead, identify any potential threats, and ensure a clear path for the rest of us.&quot;
His gaze then shifted towards Henry, a quiet student with a surprising strength about him. &quot;Henry,&quot; Alfred addressed him, &quot;you and your friends will form the Security Element. You'll be responsible for disrupting the Black Hand's communication lines, essentially cutting them off from reinforcements and creating a communication blackout within their hideout.&quot;
A determined glint flickered in Henry's eyes. &quot;We're on it, Lieutenant,&quot; he said, a hint of pride coloring his voice. &quot;We'll make sure they can't call for help.&quot;
Alfred acknowledged his response with a satisfied nod, then turned to address the remaining students. &quot;The rest of you will join forces with Henry's group,&quot; he explained, &quot;providing additional muscle and ensuring a secure passage for the retrieval team.&quot; His gaze landed on Eddie and Will, a flicker of trust passing between them.
&quot;Eddie, Will,&quot; Alfred continued, his voice taking on a more serious tone, &quot;you two will be the Assault Element. Your primary objective: secure the captives. Get them out of that hideout as quickly and efficiently as possible.&quot;
The two friends exchanged a silent glance, a wordless oath of determination passing between them. With a resolute nod, they confirmed their acceptance of the daunting task.
Alfred's eyes then met Corporal Gareth's, his right-hand man in this operation. &quot;Corporal Gareth,&quot; he said, a hint of respect lacing his voice, &quot;you'll lead the Support Element. Once the Assault Team retrieves the captives, you'll be their extraction point, ready to whisk them away from the Undercity.&quot;
A curt nod from Gareth was his only response, but the steely glint in his eyes spoke volumes. He, like Alfred, understood the importance of their roles.
Finally, Alfred addressed Christine, Geralt, and their group from the Conjuration Department. &quot;You lot,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with a hint of amusement, &quot;will serve as our heavy hitters. If things get messy, we'll be counting on your destructive magic to provide cover fire.&quot;
Christine, perched precariously on the edge of Mr. Jester's kitchen counter, scoffed. &quot;Don't worry, Lieutenant,&quot; she retorted, her voice laced with a dangerous edge, &quot;we'll make sure they regret ever crossing us.&quot;
Alfred couldn't help but offer a wry smile at her bravado. He knew they packed a powerful punch, both magically and in terms of their unwavering determination.
His final words were directed towards Madeleine, a young woman with a gentle aura despite the circumstances. &quot;Once you've successfully escaped the Undercity,&quot; he explained, &quot;regroup at the designated rendezvous point on the outskirts of Archaea. Madeleine, Claire, and your friends from the healing faculty will be stationed there, ready to assess and treat any injuries.&quot;
&quot;We'll be prepared, Lieutenant,&quot; chirped Madeleine, her voice brimming with a quiet confidence.
A lone student, their voice barely a whisper, broke the tense silence. &quot;Casualties? Does that mean that we could…?&quot; they stammered, their eyes wide with fear.
&quot;Die?&quot; another student finished their question, their voice trembling.
Alfred met their gaze with a somber expression. &quot;There are no guarantees when entering enemy territory,&quot; he admitted. &quot;We must prepare for all possibilities. But know this,&quot; he continued, his voice firm and unwavering, &quot;our goal is to get everyone out of there alive as soon as possible.”
The air hung heavy in the room, thick with the weight of the information they had just absorbed. The briefing had painted a stark picture of the dangers that awaited them, and a tremor of fear ran through the group. Glances were exchanged, some filled with apprehension, others with a newfound resolve.
In that charged silence, Mr. Jester stepped forward, his voice a welcome anchor. &quot;Remember,&quot; he said, his gaze sweeping across the room, &quot;you're not embarking on this journey alone. We've planned meticulously, considered every angle, and we'll have your back every step of the way.&quot;
A collective breath seemed to ease the tension, a flicker of hope igniting in some eyes.
Alfred, sensing the shift in the atmosphere, relaxed his rigid posture. The steely commander melted away, replaced by the familiar Alfred Eddie knew – a man of quiet compassion and unwavering determination. &quot;Stick together,&quot; he said, his voice softer now, &quot;stay focused on the mission at hand. Your courage in being here, in facing this danger head-on, is already a testament to your strength. We'll get them back, I have no doubt.&quot;
His words, laced with a quiet confidence, resonated through the room. A spark of determination flickered in each pair of eyes, replacing the initial fear with a steely resolve.
They were no longer just students, activists, or grieving families. In that moment, they were a unit, bound by a shared purpose, a common enemy. They had a plan, a team of experienced allies, and the unwavering belief in their mission. The weight of the unknown still pressed down on them, but beneath it, a newfound strength had taken root. They were ready.
As the weight of the briefing settled in, the initial shock gave way to a grim determination. The students, Eddie, Will, Henry, Madeleine, Claire, Christine, Geralt, and the rest, gathered their belongings. Fear still lingered in their eyes, a shadow cast by the dangers they were about to face. Even Christine, known for her brash fearlessness, couldn't entirely mask the tremor in her hand.
But alongside the fear, a steely resolve had taken root. Alfred's unwavering confidence and Mr. Jester's unwavering support had instilled a flicker of hope that burned brighter than the fear. They were a team now, a motley crew of students, activists, and healers transformed by a shared purpose.
With strategic plans etched in their minds and a newfound sense of unity pulsing through the group, they prepared to step into the night. The air outside was thick with anticipation, the weight of the unknown pressing down on them. Yet, their fear was tempered by a newfound resolve. They were no longer just individuals – they were a unit, bound by love, courage, and a desperate yearning to bring their friends home.
&quot;We'll commence the operation tomorrow morning,&quot; Mr. Jester announced, his voice cutting through the tension. &quot;We'll split up and meet at designated locations in Archaea. Does that work for everyone?&quot;
A chorus of nods rose from the group. A plan had been laid out, roles assigned, and a silent oath sworn. They were ready.
A small smile played on Henry's lips. &quot;I can take us to Archaea in my car,&quot; he offered, looking at Eddie, Will, Madeleine, and Claire. A playful jab followed. &quot;Just make sure Will doesn't light up another cigarette in my car, alright?&quot;
Will feigned offense, but a grin tugged at the corners of his lips. &quot;Hey!&quot; he protested, injecting a much-needed dose of levity into the tense atmosphere. &quot;Seriously, Henry, now's not the time to bring up my smoking habits.&quot;
The light banter, a shared memory from simpler times, brought a wave of comfort to the room. Maybe, just maybe, they could get through this, together. They had each other, a cunning plan, and a fierce determination. And with a flicker of hope burning bright, they stepped out into the night, ready to face the darkness that awaited them in the Undercity. </Text>

            <Text>Eddie stepped through the gate, and the moment his foot crossed the threshold, the air changed. It was warmer here, lighter. He could hear the rustle of grass underfoot, the creaking of wood in the distance, and the soft grunts and murmurs of things—living things—all around him.
He followed close behind Madeleine, taking in the view.
The sheer scale of the place stopped him in his tracks.
Compared to the Book Pirates' so-called “headquarters”—a musty, booze-stained basement barely large enough for a table and mismatched chairs—this was… acres. Fences crisscrossed the landscape, separating fields and paddocks, with stone paths winding between tall grass and wildflowers. Some cabins stood off to the side, their moss-covered roofs blending with the landscape, while distant sheds and enclosures dotted the horizon like watchful outposts.
And the creatures.
There were creatures everywhere.
A herd of something deer-like but scaled grazed lazily near the fence. Bright-feathered bird-beasts perched on low posts, ruffling their wings with annoyed chirps. A furry, long-legged animal with too many eyes blinked up at Eddie from behind a fence and then went back to chewing on a branch.
“This is the front range,” Madeleine said, her tone casual but proud. “We keep the gentler ones closer to the gate. Rescue gryphlings, retired hippogriffs, a few centaur folk who don’t mind being neighbors.”
Eddie’s eyes wandered further out, where the landscape dipped into shadowy groves and distant enclosures. “And the dragons?”
“Back there,” she said, nodding toward the tree line in the far distance. “We keep the more aggressive or high-risk creatures farther out—dragons, manticores, anything that breathes fire or bites through steel.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow. “And that’s where you want to take me?”
She nodded. “Eventually, yes.”
Eddie gave a skeptical chuckle, leaning slightly on his crutch. “Because nothing says recovery like a stroll through the fire-breathing death animals.”
Madeleine laughed. “You haven’t even met one of the cute fire-breathing animals yet.”
Eddie blinked. “I’m sorry, did you just put ‘cute’ and ‘fire-breathing’ in the same sentence?”

-o-

Eddie looked out over the Sanctuary again. Even from here, he could see the faint shimmer of heat waves rising from the far end, where the tree line thickened and the fences became taller, reinforced with wards and polished iron. Something inside him stirred—a mix of nerves, curiosity, and that same stubborn instinct that had made him board the bus in the first place.
Madeleine rolled her eyes fondly. “Before that, I need to speak to someone,” 
She led the way toward a modest stone building tucked under a slope, ivy creeping along its walls and a slanted roof sagging just slightly at the edges. A hand-painted sign above the door read: Caretaker’s Office. Eddie followed her in, the faint scent of parchment and pine oils wafting from within.
At the reception desk, instead of the usual student attendant, Madeleine nearly collided with Professor Gareth Hudson—tall, silver-haired, and impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray waistcoat, his presence as polished as the alchemy vials he carried. A harried student trailed behind him, arms stacked with ledgers titled Species Classification &amp; Behavioral Anomalies.
“Oh, I’m so sorry Professor, I was-“
“Ah, Mrs. Daedallia, not to worry,” Hudson said, his voice smooth and deliberate, like honey over steel. “A pleasure, as always.” His gaze flicked to Eddie, and a faint smile touched his lips. “Mr. Welton. States Transformation, I ? I must admit, I never expected one of my own students to show such… enthusiasm for mystical fauna.” 
Eddie stiffened at the backhanded compliment but forced a grin. “Guess I’m just… expanding my horizons, Professor.”
Hudson’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “How commendable.” He turned back to Madeleine, tilting his clipboard toward her. “Now, what brings Edenfield’s finest caretaker to the administrative den? Surely not my scintillating company.”
Madeleine’s fingers twitched toward the empty keyhook behind the desk. “I need access to the Back Range. For a tour.”
“A tour?” Hudson’s eyebrow arched. “With this one?” He gestured to Eddie’s crutch, his tone light but edged with skepticism. “The Back Range is no place for convalescents. Unless”—his voice dropped, almost playful—“you’ve discovered a therapeutic application for wyvern venom I haven’t?”
The student behind him stifled a nervous laugh. Madeleine’s jaw tightened.
Hudson tapped his clipboard with a gloved finger. “Fortunately for you, I’ve just finished compiling data from the Back Range.” He gestured to the student behind him, who hurried to place the ledgers on the desk. “Though I’d advise against lingering for too long.” His gaze lingered on Eddie’s crutch. “Predators do so love uneven footing.”
Madeleine ignored the jab. “We’ll manage.”
“I’m sure you will.” Hudson’s smile was razor-thin. “Mr. Jones has the key. Do remember to return it.” He paused, as if struck by a thought. “Ah, and Madeleine? The Student Council’s new security memo applies to all staff. Even you.” He adjusted his cuffs, then gestured to the waiting student. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, these reports won’t transcribe themselves.”
Then he was gone, the sound of his polished shoes fading down the hall, leaving behind the faint scent of bergamot and something sharper—ozone, maybe, or the ghost of an alchemical reaction.
At the reception desk, a student leaned back in a worn leather chair, on the table there is a name tag Hughes Jones. He is flipping through a thick ledger with one hand and munching on something out of a paper bag with the other. He looked up as they entered.
“Hey Hughes,” Madeleine greeted, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Who was in charge of the gates today?”
Hughes—tall, freckled, popped the rest of his snack into his mouth and replied around a chew. “Victor. Why?”
Madeleine’s brows furrowed. “Why were the gates closed? It’s not past hours yet.”
Hughes shrugged, “As you heard from Professor Hudson,” he said as he flipped the ledger around lazily. “Security reasons.”
Madeleine blinked, clearly offended. “What security? We already have three layers. There’s the perimeter fences, the Illusory Gate, and the fact that the entire Sanctuary is surrounded by a cloaked forest. Nothing gets in or out without going through the gate. You know that right?”
“I know,” Hughes sighed like he’d been waiting for this part. “Look, I just follow the memo, alright? Got word from the Student Council folks that we needed to re-evaluate the Sanctuary’s security measures. Something about recent creature attacks near campus.” He held up a crumpled newspaper. “They thought it was us, and has gave us a warning. If we don’t comply, they’ll start pulling campus support.”
“That’s ridiculous,” Madeleine snapped, eyes narrowing. “We’ve done a full count. There’s nothing missing, nothing added. Every species is accounted for.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Hughes said, shrugging again. “If the Student Council says I jump, I ask how high. I don’t make the rules, Madeleine.”
Madeleine, more composed now, held out her hand. “Fine. Just give me the key to the Back Range. I’m giving my friend a tour.”
Hughes hesitated a beat, then opened a drawer and slid out a slender iron key. “Here,” he said, but gave Eddie a pointed look. “Just… be careful, alright? Last thing I need is a second ‘incident report’ because someone wandered into a wyvern nest with a limp.”
Eddie raised a brow. “Hey, you guys talking about me?” he said, in mock offense. “Because I thrive in wyvern-infested terrain, thank you very much.”
Madeleine smirked but didn’t linger. “Thanks, Hughes,” she said, snatching the key before turning on her heel. “Come on.”
Eddie followed her out, crutch thudding softly against the wooden floor as the door creaked shut behind them. Sunlight filtered through the trees again as they stepped onto the winding dirt path toward the Back Range, the air cooler, quieter, and oddly charged—like something was waiting just ahead.

            <Title>Chapter 15E</Title>
            <Text>The scene shifts once more, casting a spotlight on Fred, his black-hooded cloak swirling dramatically behind him as he enters the communication channels room. The air crackles with a low hum of machinery, a constant symphony of technological whirring and buzzing. The scent of ozone and hot metal hangs heavy, a testament to the tireless work of the cultists maintaining the room's intricate machinery.
Fred approaches one of the figures hunched over a control panel, a wiry man with a nervous twitch to his eye. &quot;All systems operational?&quot; Fred inquires, his voice low and guarded.
The cultist jumps slightly at the sound, his gaze darting nervously towards Fred. &quot;Y-yes, sir,&quot; he stammers, his voice betraying a tremor of fear. &quot;Everything seems to be in order. No disruptions detected on any channels.&quot;
Fred narrows his eyes, his gaze lingering on the man a beat too long. The cultist's nervous demeanor does little to quell the suspicion gnawing at Fred's gut. Yet, the man's hands move with practiced efficiency across the control panel, and there's no outward sign of deception.
&quot;Good,&quot; Fred replies curtly, his voice offering no reassurance. &quot;Maintain vigilance. Report any anomalies immediately.&quot;
The cultist offers a shaky nod as Fred turns away, his keen eyes scanning the room once more. An undeniable tension hangs in the air, thick and oppressive like the humid atmosphere. It prickles at Fred's senses, a subtle tremor hinting at a storm brewing beneath the surface.
He strides purposefully towards a far corner, his attention snagged by a peculiar device tucked away in the shadows. Unlike the familiar banks of communication equipment, this device is a tangled mess of wires and circuits, an alien technology seemingly out of place in this utilitarian space.
Fred approaches cautiously, his brow furrowing in deep concentration. He reaches out a tentative hand, but hesitates before making contact. A sudden realization dawns on him, a revelation that chills him to the bone. This isn't some arcane artifact; it's a jamming device, a malicious tool specifically designed to disrupt communication signals and sever any connection to the outside world.
Tracing the wires back to their source, Fred's heart plummets. The intricate design, the meticulous construction – it all bears the unmistakable mark of Henry, the stoic upperclassman from the Automaton Engineering Faculty. Henry, always a prodigy with technology, but Fred never imagined his talents would be used for such a treacherous purpose.
A surge of anger flares within Fred, a white-hot fury fueled by betrayal. Henry, their comrade, had not only disobeyed orders but actively crippled their communication network. Now, they were isolated, stranded in the Black Hand's fortress with no way to call for help.
But there's no time for wallowing in self-pity. Fred steels his resolve, shoving aside the bitter sting of betrayal. He needs to act, and quickly, to find a way to bypass the jamming device and re-establish communication. With a newfound determination etched on his face, Fred strides out of the communication room, his mind already racing with a plan.
Unbeknownst to Fred, a lone figure cloaked in shadows observes the entire scene unfold. Henry stands at a distance, his monocular trained on the communication room. A flicker of unease crosses his features as he witnesses Fred's keen interest in the jamming device.
&quot;There's something wrong,&quot; he mutters to himself, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;They're onto me. I need to warn Christine and Geralt.&quot;
With a newfound sense of urgency, Henry scurries away from his vantage point, his mind racing to devise a way to alert Christine and Geralt of the impending discovery. The weight of his actions hangs heavy on him, the burden of his divided loyalties threatening to crush him.
-o-
The tension in the air was a tangible thing, a viper poised to strike. Will and Walt stood locked in a silent standoff, the space between them thick with unspoken history and simmering betrayal. Will's heart hammered a frantic tattoo against his ribs, each beat a desperate plea for a solution. He couldn't let Walt breach the cellar doors, couldn't risk exposing Eddie and the escapees.
&quot;Walt,&quot; Will finally forced out, his voice a threadbare whisper against the oppressive silence. &quot;Don't do this.&quot;
Walt's face, obscured by the shadows cast by his hood, remained unreadable. But the flicker of raw power that ignited in his eyes spoke volumes. &quot;Move aside, Will,&quot; his voice a low growl. &quot;This doesn't concern you.&quot;
Will's spine stiffened. &quot;It concerns everyone if you hurt them.&quot; Every fiber of his being screamed at him to run, to warn Eddie, but his feet remained rooted to the spot. He wouldn't abandon his friends, not now, not ever.
&quot;They're not your friends, Will,&quot; Walt spat, his voice laced with a bitter venom. &quot;They never were.&quot;
The words struck a raw nerve, and a surge of anger momentarily eclipsed Will's fear. &quot;They're more my friends than you'll ever be, Walt,&quot; he retorted, his voice gaining strength with each syllable. &quot;We may have been brothers once, but you chose this path. Now let me stand guard.&quot;
A humorless scoff escaped Walt's lips. &quot;Guarding a nest of vipers, are we? How noble.&quot; He raised a hand, his fingers crackling with a malevolent energy. &quot;Step aside, or I'll remove you myself.&quot;
Will felt a surge of his own magic rise to meet the challenge. There would be no turning back now. With a battle cry that echoed through the corridor, he lunged forward, a torrent of raw power unleashed from his fingertips. But Walt was a formidable opponent, years spent honing his dark arts making him a swift and deadly adversary. His counter-spell slammed into Will's like a battering ram, the force of the impact sending him sprawling backwards.
The world spun as Will hit the ground with a sickening thud, the air knocked from his lungs. Pain lanced through him, a searing agony that threatened to consume him. He tasted blood, metallic and sharp, as he struggled to his knees. Through the haze of pain, he saw Walt advancing, his face a mask of cold fury. With a sickening crash, Will collided with the stairs leading down to the cellar, his world spinning as he struggled to regain his senses. Pain lanced through him as he fought to push himself upright, the sound of footsteps echoing in his ears.
A jolt of pain ripped through Will as he slammed into the unforgiving stone floor. The world tilted on its axis, his vision blurring at the edges. But just as despair threatened to consume him, he felt a pair of hands – Ashley's – steady him before he could hit his head.
&quot;Will!&quot; Ashley's voice, a grounding force in the swirling chaos, filled his ears. &quot;What happened? Are you hurt?&quot; Her gaze darted to the spreading stain of crimson blooming on his cloak.
Will blinked, trying to focus. Pain lanced through him with every ragged breath, but the urgency of the situation pushed it aside. &quot;Walt… he's coming for you. You need to get out of here. Now!&quot;
He pushed himself upright, Ashley's hand a lifeline keeping him from collapsing again. As their eyes met, Eddie's frantic voice cut through the tension-filled air. He stood at the cellar entrance, his face etched with horror as he witnessed Walt's relentless approach.
A cold dread settled in Eddie's stomach as he saw the glint of dark magic crackling between Walt's fingers. The playful, easygoing classmate he once knew was a distant memory, replaced by this cold, ruthless stranger.
&quot;Walt,&quot; Eddie's voice cracked with a mixture of betrayal and disbelief. &quot;You're a traitor. You've turned your back on everything you build up.&quot;
Walt let out a harsh scoff, his features twisted in a sneer. &quot;Spare me the self-righteous sermons, Eddie. We're all pawns in this grand game, and the only way to survive is to play by the rules.&quot; His gaze swept over the terrified captives huddled in the cellar, their fear a tangible presence in the air.
Meanwhile, a symphony of frantic activity played out elsewhere. In the communication room, Fred's fingers danced across the control panel, his brow furrowed in intense concentration. A sigh of relief escaped his lips as the disrupted channels crackled back to life, reconnecting them to the outside world. But even with the lines open, he knew their fight was far from over. The news he had to deliver was grim, a heavy weight settling in his gut.
Outside the fortress walls, Christine, Geralt, and Henry shared a tense look. An invisible thread of worry connected them, a premonition of disaster hanging heavy in the air. The silence from within the fortress was deafening, broken only by the faint, chilling echo of battle. They knew, with a chilling certainty, that their friends were in dire need of help.
Steeling their nerves, Christine, Geralt, and Henry exchanged a silent nod. It was time. The rescue mission, fraught with danger and uncertainty, was a go. The fate of their friends, and perhaps the world itself, rested on their shoulders.

            <Title>Chapter 19E</Title>
            <Text>Madam Ingram stood firm at the fortress exit, surrounded by a motley assortment of cultists and beasts of every shape and size. Despite the overwhelming odds against her, she remained resolute, her mace held firmly in hand as she awaited the arrival of her adversary.
After what felt like an eternity, a towering figure emerged from the shadows, the sound of iron boots echoing ominously against the stone floor. Lord Raven, his imposing presence commanding the attention of all those present, approached with calculated purpose.
&quot;Should've left me alone in my retirement, Raven,&quot; Madam Ingram's voice cut through the tense silence, her words carrying the weight of years of experience and determination.
Lord Raven's masked visage betrayed no emotion as he responded, his voice muffled yet filled with icy resolve. &quot;Ah, but then you should have left our business alone, Torianna Ingram of the Royal Paladins.&quot; he cackled, “Your time is past, your glory faded.”
Madam Ingram tightened her grip on her mace, her gaze unwavering. &quot;The Black Hand should have been disbanded decades ago by the order of Queen Isobel III,&quot; she declared, her voice tinged with righteous anger.
Lord Raven's lip curled into a disdainful sneer. &quot;Queen Isobel is no more,&quot; he retorted. &quot;She can't stand in our way now.&quot;
The surrounding cultists chuckled darkly at his words, their loyalty to their master unshakeable.
Madam Ingram's eyes narrowed as she raised her mace, pointing it squarely at Lord Raven. &quot;So it was your doing,&quot; she accused, her voice laced with contempt. &quot;You killed the Queen.&quot;
There was no verbal confirmation, but the steely gaze and satisfaction in Lord Raven's eyes spoke volumes, confirming her suspicions.
&quot;Then farewell,&quot; Madam Ingram declared, her mace glowing with an ethereal white light. &quot;I shall avenge her.&quot;
With a resolute determination, Madam Ingram charged forward, her mace swinging with righteous fury. Lord Raven met her attack head-on, the clash of their weapons echoing through the fortress as they engaged in a battle that would determine the fate of not just themselves, but the entire kingdom.
The clash of steel echoed through the fortress as Madam Ingram and Lord Raven engaged in a battle of epic proportions. Each blow reverberated with the force of their conflicting ideologies, the clash of light against darkness.
Madam Ingram's mace swung with precision and power, fueled by a righteous fury that burned deep within her soul. She fought not only for herself but for the memory of Queen Isobel III, a monarch she had sworn to protect and serve. With each strike, she sought to avenge the fallen queen and bring justice to her memory.
Lord Raven, however, proved to be a formidable adversary. His mastery of dark magic was unparalleled, his staff crackling with malevolent energy as he countered Madam Ingram's every move. He taunted her with cruel words and mocking laughter, seeking to undermine her resolve and weaken her spirit.
But Madam Ingram refused to falter. Her eyes blazed with determination, her heart filled with a fierce resolve. With each insult hurled her way, her anger only grew, fueling her determination to emerge victorious.
The battle raged on, the two adversaries locked in a deadly dance of blades and spells. The cultists watched in awe and fear, their loyalty torn between their master and the formidable warrior who dared to challenge him.
As the intensity of the battle reached its peak, Madam Ingram's blows grew more ferocious, fueled by a primal rage that consumed her. She fought not only for vengeance but for the future of the kingdom, for the ideals of justice and righteousness that she held dear.
And then, in a final, decisive strike, Madam Ingram's mace collided with Lord Raven's staff with a resounding clang. A shockwave rippled through the air, sending sparks flying in all directions.
For a moment, there was silence. The fortress seemed to hold its breath as the outcome of the battle hung in the balance.
Lord Raven fell to his knees, defeated by Madam Ingram's unwavering resolve. Gasping for breath, he admitted to his crimes, confessing to the murder of Queen Isobel III.
Madam Ingram's eyes blazed with righteous anger as she demanded the truth. But before Lord Raven could respond, his laughter filled the air, echoing off the crumbling walls of the fortress.
With a wicked grin, Lord Raven raised his hands, and the very roof of the fortress began to collapse around them. Stones and pillars tumbled from above, threatening to bury them both beneath tons of rubble.
Madam Ingram knew she had to act fast. With a swift motion, she transformed into a three-headed wolf, her powerful form allowing her to evade the falling debris with ease. As the fortress crumbled behind her, she raced towards the light, determined to escape the chaos and destruction in her wake.
The cultists watched in horror as their fortress collapsed, their master defeated and their plans in ruins. But for Madam Ingram, the battle was far from over. With the truth about Queen Isobel III's death finally revealed, she knew that her quest for justice was only just beginning. And as she emerged into the light, her resolve burned brighter than ever before, guiding her towards a future where darkness would be vanquished, and the memory of her beloved queen would be honored and avenged.
As the dust settled and the echoes of the crumbling fortress faded into the darkness of the Undercity, the figure of the three-headed wolf stood atop the roof, a silent sentinel overlooking the chaos below. Madam Ingram, now transformed into her formidable lupine form, sensed that this battle was far from over. The Raven may have been temporarily defeated, but she knew all too well that he was not one to be vanquished so easily. Their paths would cross again, of that she was certain.
With a heavy heart and a determined spirit, Madam Ingram turned away from the crumbling fortress and the lingering shadows of her past. She knew that her duty lay elsewhere now, among the brave souls who had fought alongside her and the innocent captives they had rescued from the clutches of the Black Hand.
With a powerful leap, the three-headed wolf bounded across the rooftops of the Undercity, her keen senses guiding her back towards her companions. As she rejoined them, she found solace in their steadfast determination and unwavering support.
Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, knowing that the bonds forged in battle were stronger than any darkness they might encounter. And as they set off into the depths of the Undercity, Madam Ingram felt a renewed sense of purpose burning within her. The Raven may lurk in the shadows, but they would be ready for him when he dared to show his face again.
-o-
As the truck rumbled along the uneven paths of the Undercity, a sense of relief washed over the group, mingling with the lingering adrenaline of their daring escape. Eddie, Will, Ashley, Henry, Geralt, Christine, Jake, Jane, and Dominic sat together, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of the truck's interior lights.
Ashley and Dominic, representing the rescued captives, expressed their gratitude to the group, their voices filled with genuine appreciation. They knew they owed their lives to their brave rescuers.
Eddie and Christine, who had often found themselves at odds with each other, shared a rare moment of agreement. They nodded in unison, acknowledging the bond that had formed between them during their harrowing ordeal.
Meanwhile, Will couldn't seem to take his eyes off Ashley, his playful demeanor masking a deeper admiration. With a mischievous grin, he broke the tension with a lighthearted comment.
&quot;Hey, Ashley,&quot; Will began, his voice teasing, &quot;Nice dress.&quot;
Ashley's cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she glanced down at her unfamiliar attire, a stark contrast to her usual practical clothing. With a playful jab to Will's shoulder, she retorted, &quot;Shut up, William!&quot; ”Hey, i guess being a sacrifice come with an unexpected wardrobe changes, huh?” Added Eddie ”Not you too, Ed! Ugh!” Protested Ashley
Laughter filled the air as the group relaxed, the tension of their escape fading into the background. Will, ever the entertainer, began to sing, his voice weaving melodies that lifted their spirits and filled the truck with warmth and camaraderie.
In that moment, surrounded by friends old and new, they found solace in each other's company. Despite the dangers that still lurked in the shadows of the Undercity, they knew they would face whatever challenges lay ahead together, their bonds stronger than ever before. And as the night stretched on, they continued their journey, united in their shared triumph and the promise of brighter days to come. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5E_V3</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine’s boots clicked softly on the stone path as she crossed the campus grounds, the foggy air curling around her like ghostly ribbons. Her scarf was pulled tight around her neck, and she buttoned her coat all the way up, her gloved hands tucked into her sleeves to fend off the creeping cold.
The lamplight from the faculty buildings spilled in golden puddles onto the walkway, but the rest of Edenfield was dim and quiet—students tucked away in their dorms or libraries, the hum of campus life reduced to stillness.
She reached the bus stop at the edge of the quad, where the wrought-iron sign swayed slightly in the breeze. The enchanted schedule flickered faintly, glowing with runes that shifted to show Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
With a quiet sigh, Madeleine sat down on the bench, the cold seeping through the wooden slats. She leaned back and let her head tilt toward the sky, watching her breath fog in the moonlight. 
Her gaze drifted out across the empty road, unfocused.
But her thoughts didn’t stay still for long. They circled back—inevitably—to her conversation with Professor Hudson.Military alchemist.
The words rattled in her thoughts. Professor Hudson—Gareth Hudson—had been a soldier. A Military Alchemist. A man who’d trained cadets at Crownstead Academy, where the kingdom’s most lethal alchemists were forged. How had she never known?
No wonder he locks lecture doors at the first bell. No wonder his grading feels like a tribunal.
And his daughter.
Madeleine’s breath fogged in the moonlight. If the girl had vanished before ever attending Edenfield, she must’ve been young. Twelve? Thirteen? The age when kids still pressed flowers into books and dreamed of working with gryphons.
Had Hudson searched for her? Had he turned his alchemy toward something darker in his grief?
Stop. She shook her head. She’d volunteered beside him for two years—watched him soothe a newborn hippogriff with hands steady as a surgeon’s, heard him mutter corrections to first-years with more patience than they deserved. The man she knew was strict, yes, but not…
Not what?
A gust of wind hissed through the trees. The lamplights flickered, painting the path ahead in erratic gold.
The nickname some students used for him suddenly made sense, her classmates used to call him Sergeant. She’d always assumed it was just for his drillmaster demeanor. Now, she wondered if they’d known more than she did.
Her steps slowed near the bus stop. The wrought-iron sign creaked in the wind, the enchanted schedule flashing Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
She sat heavily on the bench, the cold seeping through her coat.
How much do we really know about anyone?
Hudson with his military past and missing child. Walther with his too-precise knowledge of tiger anatomy and those surgical scars on his wrists.
Her hand drifted to her satchel, where the sketch of the chimaera lay hidden.
Two men with secrets. Two men who’d stared at that drawing like it was a ghost.
The bus loomed in the distance, its windows glowing like a beacon.
Still, something didn’t sit right.
She sat up straighter, her fingers curling against her knees. Wait.
Two things clicked. Then three. Then four.
Madeleine’s breath caught in her throat.
Research… deep anatomical knowledge… access to vulnerable populations… a strange, cold fascination with a creature that shouldn’t exist…
Her hand flew to her satchel, as if instinctively checking her sketches were still there.
Her face slowly paled, lips parting slightly as a horrible thought took shape. Not fully formed—but enough to cast a shadow over everything she’d been trying to ignore.
Could it be?
No. No, that’s insane… she told herself. But her gut didn’t agree. Her heart was thudding now, dull and fast beneath her scarf. The pieces didn’t fit perfectly—but they sat too close not to touch.
The wind picked up again, rustling the trees behind the shelter.
Madeleine stared ahead, her eyes wide, her breath held.
The bus rolled up in the distance. But she no longer felt the comfort of home awaiting her. Only a hollow, rising dread.

-o-

The hands clamped on Eddie’s arms weren’t painful, but they were firm, unyielding. A wall of muscle flanked him on either side, their matching Student Council armbands stark against their dark jackets. They marched him down the silent, echoing corridors of the Alchemy Faculty building, his recently healed ankle feeling fine but offering no chance of a successful escape. He’d been so close. A few more minutes with Hudson’s files and he might have found something. Instead, he’d found them.
He tried for a disarming grin, a tactic that rarely worked but was better than silence.
&quot;Come on, guys,&quot; Eddie said, his voice echoing slightly in the empty hall. &quot;How do you know I was snooping around the professor’s office? How do you know that maybe Professor Hudson didn't just send me to his office to fetch him the stuff he forgot?&quot;
The council member on his right, a boy with a neck as thick as a tree trunk, didn’t even look at him. &quot;You are not his lecture assistant,&quot; he said, his voice a flat monotone. &quot;You shouldn't have access to his office to begin with.&quot;
&quot;Well, I know, I know,&quot; Eddie pressed on, trying to keep his tone light. &quot;But what if I'm his favourite student? Shouldn’t you think I have access then?&quot;
&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; said the one on the left. &quot;You broke curfew, and you were in a place where you don't belong.&quot;
The first one added the final nail to the coffin. &quot;And also, you are Edward Welton.&quot; The way he said the name made it sound like a pre-existing condition. &quot;This is your third warning. Your last warning.&quot; He steered Eddie toward the grand staircase leading to the administrative wing. &quot;Victoria wants to see you.&quot;
Eddie let out a sigh, the fight draining out of him. Victoria Aynesworth, head of the Student Council and a stickler for rules so rigid they made Hudson look laid-back. This was bad.
&quot;Oh, great,&quot; he muttered, then added with a layer of sarcasm thick enough to cut with a knife, &quot;Can't wait to see her.&quot;
The two students marched him up the grand staircase and down a corridor lined with portraits of past university deans whose painted eyes seemed to follow him with stern disapproval. They stopped before a set of imposing double doors carved from dark oak. One of the guards pushed a door open, revealing the Student Council room.
It looked less like an office and more like a judge’s private chambers. A vaulted ceiling disappeared into shadows high above, the walls were lined with dark wood paneling, and the air was still and cold. A single, massive desk stood on a raised dais at the far end of the room, stark and empty. It didn’t surprise Eddie in the slightest.
He was guided to a lone wooden chair positioned in the center of the floor and sat down, the guards retreating to stand impassively by the door. It was well past midnight; he hadn't expected anyone to be here, least of all the Council Head herself. He was wrong.
“Where did you find him this time?”
The voice was sharp, cutting through the silence from the shadowed corner of the room. It was Victoria.
“The Professor's room,” the guard on the right reported, his voice flat. “He was caught going through Professor Gareth Hudson's personal files.”
“And the two others?” Victoria’s voice was coolly analytical. “Have you checked? He never goes alone.”
“I was alone this time.”
Eddie’s voice cut across the room, firm and clear, startling the guard who had begun to answer. He didn't look at them; he stared directly into the shadows where she was hidden. “You don’t have to worry about Will and Ashley. I went alone.”
A beat of silence hung in the cavernous room. Then, the sound began—the sharp, deliberate clack of heels against the cold stone floor. A figure started to emerge from the darkness, moving with unhurried purpose. As she stepped into the faint light spilling from the hallway, her form was revealed.
She was dressed in a dark tweed blazer over a pristine collared shirt and a pleated skirt that fell exactly to her knees. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a severe, intricate braid, not a single strand out of place. She was posh, precise, and carried an air of authority that made the two brutes by the door seem like mere decoration.
She stopped a few feet in front of his chair, her gaze level and unnervingly direct.
“So,” she said, a faint, unreadable smile touching her lips. “Edward Welton, isn’t it? I’m glad we finally met.”
Victoria’s gaze was sharp, analytical, as if she were examining a particularly curious but troublesome specimen. One of the guards by the door stepped forward, his shadow falling over Eddie.
“Your phone and staff,” the guard said, his voice a low rumble. He gestured to a small, empty table across the room. “On the table. Now.”
Eddie’s jaw tightened. They were disarming him. It was a clear message: they knew he was more than just a common rule-breaker. With a defiant slowness, he reached into his jacket, pulled out the collapsible length of his alchemy staff and the sleek black rectangle of his phone, and walked them over to the designated table. The click of the staff settling on the polished wood sounded unnervingly final. He returned to his chair feeling distinctly more vulnerable.
As he sat, Victoria began to move, her heels making sharp, deliberate clicks on the stone floor as she started to circle him. In her hands, she held a clipboard, a single sheet of paper clipped neatly to its surface.
“You’ve become something of a celebrity this term, Welton,” she said, her voice a cool, even tone that offered no hint of her thoughts. “A recurring topic of discussion in our weekly disciplinary meetings.”
She paused behind him, forcing him to sit rigidly still, every nerve on edge.
“Let’s review, shall we?” she continued, the rustle of the paper unnaturally loud in the silence. “First, there was the incident in the main library after curfew. A simple warning.”
Her footsteps continued their measured circuit.
“Then, the unauthorized removal of a text from the restricted section. A second, more severe warning.” She stopped in his peripheral vision, tapping the paper with a perfectly manicured nail. “And now tonight. Breaking into a professor’s private office and going through his personal files.”
She completed her circle, coming to a stop in front of him once more. She lowered the clipboard, her gaze finally locking onto his.
“Looking at this record,” she said, her tone laced with a kind of detached curiosity, “a clear pattern of escalation… I find myself wondering, Welton. I wonder why I haven't simply forwarded this to the Faculty Dean and been done with it.”
The question hung in the air, a threat veiled as a musing. Eddie swallowed, his mind racing for an excuse, a plausible lie—anything.
“Look,” he started, trying to sound reasonable. “It was a simple mistake. Professor Hudson asked me to fetch a book from his office. He’d forgotten it.”
Victoria didn’t even blink. She flipped a page on her clipboard with a soft rustle. “Professor Hudson began a three-day personal leave this evening. An official notice was posted.” She looked up at him, her eyes cold and dissecting. “If you’re going to lie, Welton, you should at least study your subject before speaking.”
He felt his face flush, his excuse crumbling into dust. He opened his mouth to conjure something else, anything else, but she cut him off with a raised hand.
“Before you invent another fabrication,” she said, her tone shifting from condescending to severe, “let’s discuss a more serious matter. It’s come to my attention that you’ve been contacting local political groups within Edenfield, trying to acquire information.” She paused, letting the weight of the new accusation land. “This is strictly forbidden. Students are permitted to join university advocacy groups. Contact with external political bodies is prohibited to avoid conflicts of interest with the Crown. You know this.”
This time, Eddie didn’t lie. The truth came out, raw and urgent. “Because there is something happening in this city! Something wrong. And I am trying to find out what the hell is going on before something worse happens!”

-o-
The bus hissed to a stop at the edge of Aetherell Reach. Madeleine didn’t wait for the doors to fully open before stepping down. She didn’t thank the driver—a small, almost sacred courtesy she never forgot. But tonight, it slipped her completely.
Her boots hit the pavement. Cold air bit at her cheeks.
She moved fast.
Madeleine spotted the phone booth at the corner just beyond the wrought-iron fence, tucked beneath a flickering lantern. She broke into a brisk jog, her satchel thudding against her side.
The glass door rattled in her grip. She shoved it open and stepped inside, heart pounding. The booth smelled of damp copper and dust, the glass fogged from the cold. Her breath ghosted across the surface as she picked up the receiver with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking.
She slipped a coin into the slot.
Dialled the number from memory.
The ring buzzed against her ear. Once. Twice.
C’mon, Eddie. Please pick up.

-o-

“You know nothing about Edenfield!” Victoria’s voice lost its icy control, sharpening with sudden, fierce anger. Her posh accent became clipped and brittle. “You are a first-year. An outsider. A foreigner from the ‘Outside World’ who waltzes in and presumes to understand the delicate balance of a city you have barely lived in.”
She stepped closer, her knuckles white where she gripped her clipboard. “You have no idea what is happening here. You don’t know that the King himself has us monitor student activity across all universities to keep people like you safe. You don’t know that if I fail—if the Council fails to keep radical elements in line—the Royal Emissary takes over our duties.”
Her voice was low and intense now, a furious torrent. “Is that what you want, Welton? The Student Council may be strict, but it is led by your peers. What happens when the King’s direct rule makes the law? Do you think you would be more free then?”
As she lectured, her words washing over him, Eddie’s focus began to drift. His eyes slid past her, toward the small table across the room where his phone lay.
It lit up.
The screen cast a faint blue glow on the polished wood. It began to buzz, the silent vibration a frantic, urgent pulse in the quiet room. From this distance, he could just make out the name on the screen.
Madeleine.
A spike of pure adrenaline shot through him, cold and sharp. His stomach dropped. Madeleine never called. Never. She texted, sent notes, left messages. A call meant something was wrong. Terribly wrong. Is she alright? Is she hurt?
“Look at me when I’m speaking to you!”
Victoria’s sharp command snapped his head back around. Her eyes were blazing. Outwardly, Eddie forced his expression into one of cowed submission, but inwardly, his mind was a whirlwind. Madeleine was in trouble. He could feel it. Whatever lecture Victoria was spewing, whatever threats she made about expulsion, it was all just noise now. He had to get out.
He remembered the ring. The cool, smooth jade Catherine had given him long ago, worn on a leather cord under his shirt. Not just a keepsake, but a conduit. A focus for his alchemy that didn't require a staff. He still had a way out.
As Victoria began to circle him again, her monologue resuming its sharp, clipped cadence, Eddie began his work. He kept his eyes fixed on her, nodding at what seemed like the right moments, but his right hand moved with slow, deliberate stealth beneath his jacket. His fingers brushed past his shirt, searching. There. The cool, familiar weight of the ring. He closed his fingers around it, focusing his will, picturing the dense, solid molecules of the stone floor.
“…and that is why we cannot tolerate this kind of reckless behavior,” Victoria concluded, stopping directly in front of him again, her posture radiating smug satisfaction. “Do you understand, Welton? The situation that you’re in?”
Eddie let a beat pass, then looked up, forcing a weak, defeated smile. He let go of the ring. “Um, yeah. I guess so.”
“Perfect,” Victoria said, mistaking his distraction for acquiescence. “Although this is your third warning, I will first speak to your dorm captain regarding your punishment. You will be confined to your dorm for three days to think about what you’ve done—”
She stopped mid-sentence, her brow furrowing in confusion. A strange pulling sensation arrested her movement.
“What the—” She looked down. Her polished leather shoes had sunk into the flagstones up to her ankles. It wasn’t mud; the stone itself seemed to have softened like clay, gripping her feet in an unyielding hold.
With a newfound calm, Eddie stood up and waltzed over to the table, collecting his smartphone and collapsible staff.
“Whoops, sorry folks,” he said cheerfully, not looking back at her. “That was a nice talk, Victoria, but I’m afraid someone is calling me, so I gotta go.”
“Hey!” she shouted, struggling to free her leg to no avail. She turned to her guards. “You two! Get him!”
The two brutes lunged forward, only to stop dead with grunts of surprise. They looked down to discover their own boots were similarly submerged, trapping them where they stood.
Eddie was already at the grand window, unlatching it and pushing it open. The cold night air rushed in. He looked back over his shoulder, a wide, sarcastic grin on his face, and gave them a little wave.
“You’ll pay for this, Welton!” Victoria screamed, her voice a mixture of fury and disbelief.
Eddie just jumped.
For a terrifying second, he fell, before he focused his will. The ornate stone bricks on the outer wall rippled. A section directly beneath his feet bulged outward, forming a small, solid platform that caught him gently. Like a silent elevator, it smoothly lowered him two stories to the frost-covered lawn below.
He landed without a sound and, without looking back, sprinted into the night.</Text>
            <Notes>On this Chapter when the POV goes back to Eddie,

Eddie should also be finding a clue too, in fact he should be the one getting the clues Harder

There will be Conflict with Victoria as Eddie is caught trying to get informations about the Political Organisations in Edenfield. Which is strictly forbidden by the Student Council, and that Students are not allowed to join the local political groups, they are only allowed to join university ones


At the end on Eddie’s persuit, Eddie stumbles upon Will and Ashley, who then goes after him together with the Student Council

            <Title>Chapter 24 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Catherine stood squarely before the dragon, her earlier wounds seemingly erased, as if the very concept of pain had never touched her. Elves were said to heal fast, their bodies resilient beyond mortal comprehension—but seeing it firsthand, seeing her move with such precision, was nothing short of myth made real.
She lifted her staff, then a shattered column from the ruins trembled, it shot forward like a cannonball—hurtling straight at the dragon’s face.
The beast turned sharply—just in time for the debris to smash against its snout.
The strike wasn’t enough to harm it.
But it was enough to enrage it.
The dragon’s five glowing eyes flared with fury.
It let out a guttural snarl, jaws snapping, and lunged toward Catherine, moving like a shadow, a blur of ice and malice.
Catherine rolled beneath it, slipping under the beast’s massive body with the grace of wind itself. She glided over the frozen rubble, weightless, effortless, as if the world itself bent to her will.
Then—her, “Edward! The gunpowder! Now!”
Eddie didn’t hesitate.
He tore the ammunition satchel from his shoulder and hurled it toward her.
Catherine caught it—
Or rather, she didn’t.
The satchel never touched her hands. Instead, it hovered, suspended in mid-air, caught in the torrents of wind spiraling around her.
And then—she, too, was floating.
Eddie’s breath caught.
His injuries, the pain in his ribs momentarily forgotten.
Catherine held her staff aloft, eyes glowing like embers, and spoke in a tongue older than time itself.
It was Elvish—but not the kind Eddie had ever heard before.
Older… More ancient… More primal…
Then—light.
A large transmutation circle flared beneath her, its glow casting shifting shadows across the ruins.
And then—more.
Circles ignited one after another, rising, expanding, multiplying—until the very sky burned with their radiance.
Orange, Red. Like the sun had shattered, as if she had called upon the sun itself into the night, and its fragments had been sewn into the heavens.
Eddie could barely breathe.
The dragon turned.
And in the beast’s many eyes, reflected in the glow of the spiraling sigils above, Eddie saw something he had never seen before in a beast.
Not anger.
Nor rage.
But Fear.
Then—Catherine brought her staff down.
Like an executioner’s axe.
Like a warlord commanding an army.
Like a knight delivering the final blow.
And from the transmutation circles… Fire.
At first, fireballs.
Then more of them…
Until eventually… a fire storm.
A maelstrom of molten lead and infernal flames rained down upon the Nightingale Dragon.
Each blast pierced its obsidian scales, the molten metal searing through its hide, embedding into flesh.
The dragon shrieked in agony.
It staggered.
It lurched back, trying to shield itself with its wings—but the firestorm was unstoppable.
Catherine pushed forward.
With every step she took, the inferno intensified.
The dragon backed away.
One step.
Another.
And then—
It spread its wings.
A single, powerful beat sent a shockwave of dust and debris spiraling into the air.
The beast hurled itself backward, rising—slowly at first, then faster, faster, until it was nothing but a dark silhouette against the burning sky.
Catherine lifted her gaze.
The dragon let out one final, piercing shriek—
And then—
It was gone.
The transmutation circles dimmed.
The firestorm ceased.
Catherine floated back down, her feet touching the frostbitten stone as the winds gently set her down.
The satchel fell beside her, the remaining bullets clinking softly against the frozen ground.
Then—
Silence.
The ruins of Craemonia stood still.

-o-
The ruins had fallen silent.
The acrid scent of burnt stone and charred scales still clung to the night air, mixing with the damp earth beneath them. Smoke curled lazily into the sky, blotting out the moon in murky tendrils. The battle was over, but the weight of it still pressed on them, settling into the quiet.
Eddie sat propped against a broken pillar, his body a tapestry of bruises, burns, and deep, aching exhaustion. His right arm throbbed—dislocated, maybe broken. His ribs ached with every breath. Blood dried in jagged streaks along his temple. He had felt worse. But not by much.
Catherine knelt beside him, her fingers deftly grinding herbs and crushed roots into a thick salve. The Codex—the ancient tome they had come for—was now securely strapped to her belt in a leather book holster, its weight a reminder that their mission, at least, was a success.
She worked in focused silence, her movements quick, practiced—too practiced. This wasn’t the first time she’d patched someone up in the field.
“Foolish of a Welton, you’re no different from your father.” she muttered under her breath, dabbing the salve onto a particularly nasty bruise along Eddie’s jaw. It burned.
Eddie hissed, his body tensing.
Catherine scoffed. “Oh, don’t be dramatic.”
“You could at least warn me,” he grumbled.
She rolled her eyes, applying another layer with absolutely no regard for his comfort. “If you had half an intellect about you, you wouldn’t have jumped into the fight like that. You nearly got yourself killed.”
Eddie let out a breathy chuckle, though it ended in a wince. “You’re welcome, by the way.”
Catherine paused. Just for a second.
Then, without looking up, she murmured, “I couldn’t find a proper ignition source.” She rubbed the salve into his shoulder, her touch firm but careful. “If you hadn’t brought the gunpowder... I would have lost.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard by the quiet admission.
She didn’t elaborate. Didn’t need to.
Instead, she reached for his arm, fingers hovering just above the dislocated shoulder. “This is going to hurt.”
Before he could protest, she jerked it back into place.
A sharp, searing pain shot through his body. Eddie bit down a curse, his vision going white at the edges. For a moment, all he could do was sit there, breathless, waiting for the pain to dull into a manageable throb.
Catherine, to her credit, at least had the decency to look mildly guilty. “It needed to be done.”
Eddie groaned. “Next time—give me a damn warning.”
A ghost of a smile flickered across her lips. “I’ll think about it.”
She busied herself again, checking over his wounds, ensuring there was nothing worse she had missed. The night stretched on in silence, the only sound the crackling embers of dying flames in the distance.
Then, quietly—too casually—Catherine spoke.
“You never told me you were expelled from Aella Academy...”
Eddie hesitated.
His gaze flickered to the ground, fingers idly tracing patterns in the dust. Aella Academy. The name alone sat heavy on his tongue, like a stone he couldn’t quite swallow.
“I... um...” he started, then faltered.
Catherine didn’t push, not right away. She simply watched him, waiting. Unyielding, but patient.
Then, in a quieter voice, she said, “Markus told me everything.”
Eddie’s stomach twisted.
“I want to hear the story from you.”
He swallowed. His gaze flickered toward the ruined path, the smoldering embers in the distance. Everything ached—his body, his head, his pride.
&quot;It’s...&quot; he exhaled, &quot;...a long story, Catherine.&quot;
She let out a small, amused sigh as she dipped a clean strip of cloth into the salve.
“Well,” she mused, pressing it gently against one of his deeper bruises. Eddie tensed at the sting, but Catherine barely seemed to notice. “We’ve got all the time in the world now.”
&quot;It’s not like the dragon’s coming back anytime soon.&quot; She gave a small chuckle at that, as if trying to ease the weight in the air.
Then, more softly, “So... how did it go?”
Eddie exhaled slowly.
For a moment, he just listened—to the crackle of distant embers, the whisper of the wind through broken stone. To the quiet.
Then, at last—
&quot;I had a duel back then. And I—&quot; Eddie began
The memory coiled around him, suffocating. His fingers twitched, then clenched into a fist.
“I scarred him, Catherine.” His voice barely rose above a whisper.
She stilled, the cloth in her hands forgotten.
“Not just a mark,” he continued, the weight of it pressing down on his chest. “A permanent burn scar.”
The firelight flickered between them, casting long, shifting shadows across the ruined stones. Catherine said nothing, waiting.
Eddie exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “I didn’t just hurt him… I ruined him.”
The night pressed in, cold and unyielding. It gnawed at his skin, but the ice settling in his gut was far worse.
“And all I could think was—” his voice cracked, breath unsteady. His heartbeat pounded in his ears. “I was a monster.”
He could still see their faces. The stares. The unspoken verdict.
His fists tightened, nails digging into his palms, but the ache was distant—nothing compared to the weight in his chest.
And then, after a long silence, he whispered, “Maybe they were right.”
He swallowed hard, the words thick in his throat.
“And I—I couldn’t bear it. Not anymore. I was done.”
His fists clenched, nails digging into his palms. The bitterness burned, hot and sharp.
“So when the academy expelled me…” He let out a hollow laugh, devoid of warmth. “Part of me was relieved.”
The fire crackled between them, filling the silence where his certainty should have been.
“It was an excuse. A reason to walk away. To leave it all behind. To finally be free of that world. That power. To stop being this… thing everyone had to fear.”
His voice trembled on the last word.
The confession left him raw, exposed. He forced himself to look at Catherine, bracing for judgment, for disgust—
But she only watched him, quiet.
Eddie exhaled, a shuddering breath. He ran a hand down his face, fingers curling against his jaw.
“But deep down…” His voice dropped to a whisper, haunted. “I can’t leave it. I can’t run from it. It’s a part of me. I can’t escape. No matter what.”
Silence.
Catherine didn’t speak right away. She didn’t rush to fill the void his words left behind. She just stood there, the weight of his guilt settling between them.
Then, finally—
Her expression softened. &quot;I see.&quot; Her voice was gentle, but there was no pity in it. Just understanding. &quot;That must have been devastating.&quot;
Eddie nodded, his voice low, tinged with regret.
&quot;I felt a guilt I’d never known before.&quot; The words came out hoarse, as if admitting it made the weight heavier. &quot;I couldn’t bear the thought of hurting someone like that again. So when I got my expulsion notice… I shut myself off from Alchemy.&quot;
He exhaled sharply. &quot;I thought if I stayed away, I could protect people. That it was the right thing to do.&quot;
His fists clenched. &quot;But it just made me numb.&quot; His gaze dropped to the ground, lost in the patterns of dirt and shadows. &quot;I lost everything that day.&quot;
Catherine suddenly stopped walking.
Her expression was serious, but not unkind. &quot;Eddie,&quot; she said, her voice calm but unwavering. &quot;Throughout history, Alchemy… Magic has been used for both great good and terrible evil.&quot;
Her gaze held his, steady with conviction.
&quot;There have been sorcerers who toppled kingdoms, enslaved millions, and committed atrocities beyond imagination.&quot;
She let that sink in before continuing.
&quot;Like Nocturnilus the Conqueror.&quot;
The name alone felt heavy in the air.
&quot;Once, he was just a spellcraftsman millenias ago—a sorcerer in service to the Northern Elven Kingdom. The elves have always lived by magic, weaving it into every part of their lives. It was a gift, a birthright, a force of creation.&quot;
Her voice darkened.
&quot;But for Nocturnilus, it was never enough.&quot;
She glanced at the treetops, as if searching for memories carved into the night sky.
&quot;Blinded by greed, by the hunger for more, he turned his power toward conquest. He was the first sorcerer to raise a city of stone with a mere gesture—and the first to reduce one to ash just as easily. He marched across the lands, toppling kings, razing kingdoms, and forging an empire from the ruins of others.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the weight of history pressing against his chest.
&quot;His armies enslaved millions, binding them with chains wrought from his own magic. He thought himself invincible.&quot;
Catherine’s voice dropped lower, almost a whisper. &quot;But the more he took, the more magic consumed him. It changed him. His flesh, his mind… his very soul. By the end, he was no longer a man. Some say he was no longer even an elf. Just a shadow, a being twisted by his own power.&quot;
&quot;And there was Aeron the Founder… One of the nine sages.&quot;
The name lingered between them like a spark in the cold night air.
&quot;He was an elf, like Nocturnilus. In fact, he once served under him—stood at his side as a fellow conjurer, weaving spells to expand Nocturnilus’s empire. For years, he followed orders, watching cities crumble, watching people enslaved by the very magic that was meant to enrich elven lives.&quot;
Catherine’s voice grew firm. &quot;But then, something changed. Aeron looked at the ruins they had left behind, at the lives shattered by conquest, and he could no longer bear it. He chose to walk away.&quot;
Eddie frowned. &quot;He just… left?&quot;
&quot;Not just left,&quot; Catherine corrected. &quot;He rebelled. He turned against the empire he had once helped build. He traveled to the very lands he had once helped destroy—not as a conqueror, but as a healer. A teacher.”
“He taught magic to those who feared it, gave power to those who had none. And in the end, it was his students, his disciples, the very people Nocturnilus had enslaved, who brought the tyrant down to his knees.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the weight of her words settling in his chest.
&quot;Aeron could have followed the same path,&quot; Catherine continued, &quot;But he chose differently. He eventually founded and became one of the Nine Sages, the very founders of the magical world as we know it.”
“He and the others built cities where there was only wasteland, cured diseases that once ravaged nations, opened doors to possibilities no one had dared to dream of before.&quot;
Eddie’s fingers twitched at his sides. His thoughts churned, Catherine’s words fighting against years of self-doubt.
Catherine didn’t hesitate. She placed a hand on his shoulder, firm and reassuring.
&quot;It’s not about what magic can do,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s about what you can to do with it.&quot;
The weight of her words settled in his chest, pressing against the scars he had buried deep.
For a moment, neither of them spoke. The night stretched quiet and still around them</Text>
            <Notes>What do they want? And why cant they have it?

Eddie wants to defeat the Nightingale Fox, an illusory Shape-shifting creature that dwells in the Illusory forest. But it keeps fading, it changes and it attacks.

Who cares? What happen if they dont get it?

What is the good news?

            <Title>Chapter 9</Title>
            <Text>The breeze continues to blow despite his raging thought. Eddie let out a long sigh, the mist of his breath flutters in the cold evening air as he did so. He walked down the uneven cobblestones of the harbour road. The faint murmur of waves lapping against the pier faded behind him, leaving just the smooth cadence of his feet on the sidewalk. Above, the moon stood high, throwing a weak reflection on Weshaven's damp roads. 
Catherine is already nowhere to be gound, in her usual manner. One minute she was at his side, her words pierced something within him he hadn't felt in years, giving him the existential crisis of a lifetime; the next, she was gone, as if nothing had just happened.
Eddie walked, stuffing his hands into his coat pockets, his breath formed a mist everything he sighed. Catherine's words remained in his memory, playing over and over like a broken record.
What happened to you? 
Eddie still didn't want to acknowledge how deeply the question had pierced him. He remembered her face, how uncharacteristically serious it looked. How seriously dejected it looked, and how within all of that, how concerned it looked.
As he moved through the streets, the distant noises of the port gave way to the faint echoes of excited conversation and laughing. Eddie stopped as he rounded a corner. 
On the town square of Mariner’s Ranch stood a little, old carriage with brightly fading paint on its sides that depicted legendary heroes and mythological animals. A banner with the words &quot;Vandruff’s Travelling Tales&quot; in gold calligraphy was draped over its front; the wording faintly reflected the light from a nearby street lamps. 
Eddie stood still. He had grown up loving evenings like these, when storytellers from different lands would bring their tales to this little hamlet called Weshaven. Knights would fight monsters and tricksters outwitted monarchs.
He remembered back when he was a kid, pushing his way to the front row, with all eyes fixed on the little stage. Back then he still believed in knights defeating the dragons, Back then he still believed in happy endings. Back then, the world beyond the stage was irrelevant for a few mere seconds as he watched these tales unfold.
 However, it was years ago, when he was someone different, someone who could lose himself in heroic and adventurous stories without thinking twice. 
You just need to be you.
The words continues to repeat in his minds, their simplicity belying the weight they contained. Now, what does that even mean? Who was &quot;him&quot; ? The Eddie she recalled? Before everything went wrong, was he the Eddie he was? 
“Thank you! Dear audience!” Announced the Puppet Master, “The next tale, is The Dragon of Groville!”
Eddie was startled out of his reverie by the children's quiet laughter. To the joy of the audience, one of the puppets—a cunning fox, apparently—had taken the knight's sword and was bouncing about the stage. Despite his advanced age, the puppet master's motions were vibrant as he laughed with them. 
Eddie remembered how he was used to be one of those children, laughing and having the time of his life.
He remembered what he told Catherine a while before, how he wasn’t that kid anymore. How he had grown, how he had lost his passion.
Well, let’s see whether that little Eddie was still there somewhere, Eddie thought to himself.
Before he could second-guess himself, Eddie walked up to the booth. 
The ticket booth near the carriage had the words &quot;Admission: 2 Coppers&quot; written on it. He dug into his pocket, his fingers brushing against a few coins. 
It was ridiculous, a somewhat inebriated, unkempt man purchasing a ticket to a puppet show. But the thought of sitting in the warm glow of the lanterns, surrounded by stories, felt like a tether to a simpler time, back when he was still a kid, back when that kid was still alive. 
The vendor handed him a small red ticket in exchange for the coins. Eddie muttered a quick thanks before slipping into the small gathering. 
The children’s laughter drowned him out as he settled at the back, their chatter a vibrant wall of sound. His dark coat and weathered boots made him stand out against the cheerful patchwork of colourful scarves and jackets the children wore. 
Over the little stage, which was embellished with painted stars, trees, and a bright moon, the lanterns created a lovely, flickering light. A wiry old guy with a sparkle in his eye, the puppeteer emerged and opened the play with a theatrical flourish. 
“Now! Onto the next tale! Gather thee close, good folk,” the puppeteer intoned, his voice deep and inviting, “And hearken thee to a tale of old—a tale of valour, cunning, and the strength of noble hearts. ‘Tis the story of Groville, a village fair, and the fearsome foe known as the Nightingale Dragon!” 
Eddie leaned back. As the stage came alive with colourful puppets, he couldn’t help but feel the nostalgia seeping in. 
The puppeteer brought out the Groville puppet, a cheerful little village bustling with tiny puppet villagers: “Behold, a day most fair and bounteous!” 
The puppeteer introduced the puppet of The Alchemist next, a regal figure robed in Red. “Stand ye strong, good folk!” the old man declared in a commanding voice, the puppet raising its glowing staff. “Together shall we face this darkness, and ne’er shall we let it consume our light!” 
Eddie’s smile faded as the story unfolded. The Alchemist couldn’t fight the Nightingale Fox alone; she needed the help of others—a cunning Witch and a valiant Bard. The puppets joined forces, their combined strengths weaving a glowing barrier around the village.
The battle was fierce, the air heavy with the Fox’s fiery wrath and the trio’s resolve. Intently, Eddie watched, the children’s eager sounds receding. 
“Thou shalt harm no more, vile beast!” The Alchemist cried. “By this bond of light, shadow, and song, I banish thee to the deep forest, where none may find thee!” 
The Fox puppet was drawn into the shadowy forest, its flames extinguished. The village erupted in cheers as the puppeteer guided the tiny villagers into a jubilant dance. 
“And so, my friends,” the puppeteer said, his voice solemn now, “remember this tale well. True strength is not in power or might, but in courage, wisdom, and the bonds we share. Let thy hearts be brave, thy spirits steadfast, and thy light unyielding.” 
As the puppets took a bow and the curtain closed, the children’s enthusiastic clapping and laughter filled the air. Eddie sat unmoving, the storyteller’s words echoing in his head. True strength is in the bonds we share. 
The children cheered, their applause echoing in the night as the old puppet master took a bow, his smile as warm as the lantern light. Eddie clapped too, though his hands moved slowly, the sound almost drowned out by the surrounding kids. 
Back then, he’d believed in happy endings.
The children leaned forward, their wide eyes reflecting the warm glow of the lanterns. Eddie stayed where he was, his head bowed slightly.
Courage, Wisdom, and Bonds.
The words twisting in his chest. Catherine’s voice echoed in his mind, her words overlapping with the puppet master’s. What happened to you? You just need to be you.
But who was he now? A stranger sitting among children, trying to grasp at a piece of his past that no longer fit. He could laugh at the absurdity of it all if it didn’t hurt so much.
As the crowd began to disperse, Eddie lingered in his seat, watching the children scamper off with their parents, their laughter filling the air.
Eddie stood and brushed the dust from his coat. The streets felt quieter now, the cold breeze of the night settling in again. 
He shoved his hands into his pockets, The breeze continues to blow despite his raging thought. Eddie let out a long sigh, the mist of his breath flutters in the cold evening air as he did so. He walked down the uneven cobblestones of the harbour road. His footsteps echoing as he made his way back to the apothecary.

Eddie eventually got accepted to Edenfield, and the Sage’s Institute waited for a reply letter that said that Eddie is accepting

Eddie talks to his mother about the acceptance, and his mother said that he have a relatives in Edenfield, her name is Catherine, and she is a weird one, Eddie tries to remember who her mother talks about, because he did not remember anyone named Catherine that is his relatives,

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 1</Title>
            <Text>Seven years.
The past had settled like dust, left undisturbed by time. 
And in its place, 
A new beginning bloomed.
A girl stood before a tall mirror, adjusting the brim of her pointed black hat. Her long, silky brown hair swayed in twin tails as she tilted her head, inspecting her reflection with wide, eager eyes behind oversized round glasses. A yellow knit sweater peeked out from beneath the freshly pressed folds of an Aella Academy robe.
She grinned.
The robe. The hat. The feeling of it all—it was real. She was finally going to Aella. She was finally going to learn the arts and traditions of magic… She is going to be a magician. 
Her heart swelled with excitement, her fingers tracing the embroidered crest on her robe. Today was the first step toward something wonderful.
A voice carried through the house, breaking her reverie.
“Torrie! Breakfast is ready! Come to the dining room!”
She spun away from the mirror, practically bouncing on her feet.
“Yes, Mom!” she called back, already rushing toward the door.
Torrie stepped into the dining room, the scent of fish soup filling the air, rich and comforting. 
Sunlight streamed through the small window above the sink, glinting off the wooden table where two steaming bowls sat waiting. Her mother, stood by the counter, wiping her hands on a cloth, her expression brimming with quiet pride.
Torrie adjusted her hat before pulling it off and setting it aside, the excitement still buzzing in her chest. Today was the day. The start of something new.
“Look at you, beginning your first years in Aella Academy.” Mrs. Welton smiled, lingering by the table, her eyes soft with nostalgia. &quot;Let me see you properly,&quot; she said, stepping closer.
Torrie straightened, smoothing the folds of her robe. &quot;Like this?&quot;
With a playful grin, Torrie twirled in place, the hem of her robe flaring out as she spun. She came to a stop with a little flourish, looking up at her mother expectantly. 
&quot;How do I look, Mom?&quot;
&quot;Like a grand magician,&quot; she said, reaching out to adjust a stray lock of hair from Torrie’s face. &quot;Or at least, one in the making.&quot;
Torrie sat back down.
&quot;You remind me so much of your brother,&quot; Mrs. Welton mused.
Torrie looked up, curious, “Do I?”
&quot;Not exactly, but you both are very excited. On his first day at Aella Academy,&quot; her mother continued, &quot;He was so eager, he didn’t even bother with breakfast. Just grabbed his things and took off on his bicycle straight to the harbor. Couldn’t wait to board the ferry to Osthaven.&quot;
Torrie chuckled, stirring her soup. &quot;Didn’t expect him to be that excited.&quot;
Mrs. Welton laughed, &quot;Oh, but he was,&quot; she said warmly.
&quot;Speaking of your brother…” She glanced toward the staircase.  “Where is he? Didn’t he say he’d be the one to take you himself?&quot;
Torrie shrugged. &quot;Haven’t seen him.&quot;
Mrs. Welton exhaled, rubbing her temple. &quot;Of course.&quot; She stood, pushing her chair back with a sigh.
Then she cupped her hands around her mouth and called up the stairs. &quot;Edward?!&quot;
Silence.
Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;You stay here, hon. I’ll go see if he’s still in his room.&quot;
She turned and strode toward the staircase, muttering under her breath. Torrie just smiled, spooning up a mouthful of soup as she waited.


-o-

The stairs groaned softly, their creaks reverberating in the stillness of the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton carefully mounted the steps. An attic was reached by a narrow wooden staircase. The polished railings sparkled under her fingertips. A small, circular window at the landing let soft light cast long shadows that danced with her every step.
With each step, the town below faded into a whisper of bustling life. Replaced by her son's room's oppressive stillness. As she rose, her free hand gently caressed the coarse wooden walls. She touched the rough spots and gouges, scars from her son's growing.
As she approached the attic door, a moment of hesitation gripped her. Pausing for a brief moment, she lifted her hand with a touch of uncertainty. The wood stood strong, though it bore the marks of time.
Mrs. Welton closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and then rapped softly with her knuckles, the sound a delicate, almost timid knock against the quietude.
“Edward?” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely breaking the stillness of the attic. She leaned in.. The other side lingered in their silence. Her brow knitted together, a delicate line appearing between her eyes. She cast a fleeting look at the door handle, an urge to twist it, yet she held back.
Instead, she knocked again, this time with a deeper intent, the sound echoing more profoundly through the room beyond.
Silence. Thick and unmoving. 
Beyond the attic door, the room lay in comfortable chaos. The space was dim, save for the slivers of morning light through his curtains. casting long, golden beams across the floor.
Clothes strewn carelessly across the floor, some draped over the back of a chair, some half-tucked under the bed, some long forgotten. 
Books were everywhere. Its stacked haphazardly on the desk, toppled over on the nightstand, spread open on the unmade bed as if abandoned mid-thought. 
Loose parchment spilled onto the wooden floor, some pages crumpled, others torn at the edges. Half-sketched transmutation circles and scribbled formulas peeked out from beneath the clutter, most of them bore the chaotic scribbling of frustation.
Its walls bore remnants of faded posters. Some curling at the edges, one hanging on by a single pin. 
A calendar sat pinned to the wall near the door, its pages frozen in time.
The last date marked in red ink from seven years ago.
26th of April, 1920.
Near the farthest wall, a wooden desk was buried beneath the weight of research. Transmutation circles sketched and then discarded overflowed from a bin at the desk’s side. Diagrams detailing herbs, plants and mushrooms. Their alchemical properties meticulously annotated in a careful yet restless hand. 
Stacked books, their spines cracked from repeated use, bore names in gilded lettering—, Modern Alchemy by Magnus Borman, and a vintage tome The Ancient Arts of Alchemy signed only Catherine. Amid the scholarly collection sat a battered notebook filled with translations of an even older text, one written by Casnius Bolos, one of the nine sages of enlightenment. The Father of Alchemy.
And slumped over it all, was the room’s lone occupant.
His maroon diamond-patterned sweater hung loosely over his slumped shoulders, its sleeves pushed up to his elbows. His silver hair fell messily over his forehead, unkempt from restless nights. His posture was hunched, arms folded beneath his head, his breathing slow and steady in slumber.
In his ears, a pair of makeshift headphones—wired together in an unorthodox fashion—hummed faintly with a distant, crackling signal. Plugged into an even more makeshift radio, the device played something indiscernible, some half-lost frequency from far beyond Weshaven. Whether it was music or the muffled voices of a broadcast, only he could tell.
The knocking at the door continued. A soft, measured rhythm, persistent against the wood.
Still, he did not stir. Succumbing to his sleep and the sounds from distant lands.

-o-


She knocked again—more resolutely, as if the sound itself could unravel the silence that enveloped the room. 

“Eddie?” She called, yet no answer. 

Mrs. Welton sighed, “Of course, I knew it’ll come to this.”

Slipping her hand into her skirt pocket and touching her wand's smooth wooden surface. With a slight wrist movement, the wand appeared. A thin piece of dark oak with intricate interlocking ornaments. 

She pointed it at the door's lock, and a gentle click rattled the quiet attic, flickering the runes around the lock before dissolving into the shadows. She tucked her wand away and gently opened the door. 

The room was full of clutter.

Mrs. Welton’s gaze swept the room, her eyebrows lifting slightly as she took in the disarray.

 “Of course,” she muttered under her breath, stepping carefully over a crumpled tunic on the floor. “A storm couldn’t have done a better job.” 

She stared at the figure slumped on the desk, immovable except for his breathing breathing. Crackling of faint jazz music could be heard from the makeshift headset on the radio.

“Edward Welton! ” she yelled, her tone sharp but laced with exasperated fondness. 
The name cut through the attic like a thunderclap.
Eddie jolted awake so violently that his chair tipped backward. His arms flailed, his headset yanked free with a sharp crackle of static, and the makeshift radio tumbled off the desk with a clatter. 
Books, parchments, loose papers exploded into the air, cascading down like confetti in a parade of overwork. His foot caught on something—maybe a discarded tunic, maybe an open book—and he tumbled off his chair entirely, landing flat on his back with a heavy thud.
From the floor, he let out a groggy, half-incoherent groan. “Mum—what the hell?”
Mrs. Welton, unimpressed, loomed over him with her hands on her hips. &quot;You agreed weeks ago to accompany Torrie on her first day of school! I'm not letting her get lost in Osthaven while you spend all morning hibernating like some bear in a cave!&quot;
She crossed the room with purpose, the floorboards thumping beneath her feet.
Eddie sat up, rubbing his silver hair, still blinking off the remnants of sleep. “Could you at least knock first?” he grumbled.
&quot;I did knock!&quot; Mrs. Welton shot back, pointing at the unlocked door. &quot;But you were too busy listening to—” she gestured vaguely at the tangled mess of wires, the radio now buzzing with distorted, half-drowned static. “—whatever that is.”
Eddie picked up his fallen headset, giving the radio a once-over before dusting it off. &quot;It's called jazz, Mum,&quot; he said, as if that explained everything. &quot;They're pretty famous in the city, you know?&quot;
&quot;Like I care about that, Edward!&quot; Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;Now get up before Torrie is late for her first day at Aella!&quot;
Eddie groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. &quot;Aella?&quot; he muttered, his voice still thick with sleep. &quot;Torrie’s in Aella now?&quot;
Mrs. Welton pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;She is. Did you forget that too?&quot;
&quot;Look, Mum,&quot; Eddie pushed himself up, wincing as he untangled his legs from a mess of books and crumpled clothes. &quot;It’s difficult to keep track of things when Dad’s remedies need tweaking every two days.&quot; He stretched, his back popping as he tried to shake off the last bits of sleep. &quot;Can I clean up a bit before we go?&quot;
Mrs. Welton bent down with a sigh, picking up the books and papers that had scattered across the floor. Unlike Eddie, who left things in precarious heaps, she stacked them neatly, smoothing out crumpled pages before placing them back onto his desk.
&quot;You should at least try to keep things organized,&quot; she scolded, adjusting a pile of alchemy notes. &quot;Honestly, Edward, I don’t know how you can work like this.&quot;
&quot;I do work like this,&quot; Eddie shot back as he pulled a fresh shirt from a chair—though it was debatable how fresh it actually was. He gave it a quick sniff before pulling it on. &quot;I’ve been busy experimenting with potion ingredients for the apothecary. It’s not like I’m just lounging around.&quot;
&quot;Experimenting?&quot; Mrs. Welton raised a skeptical brow, lifting a parchment with a half-sketched transmutation circle and an irritated scribble of DOES NOT WORK. &quot;It looks more like you’ve been failing repeatedly.&quot;
Eddie scoffed, fumbling to button his shirt. &quot;That’s how experimentation works, Mum. Trial and error. Mostly error.&quot;
Mrs. Welton shook her head, muttering something about alchemy not excusing poor housekeeping as she continued gathering the mess. Eddie, meanwhile, laced up his boots at a painfully slow pace, buying time.
Their banter bounced back and forth, the practiced rhythm of a mother and son who had long since mastered the art of exasperating each other. Eddie mumbled complaints about unfair criticism, while Mrs. Welton countered with pointed reminders about personal responsibility.
Until—
She paused.
A single sheet of paper had slipped beneath a stack of old notes. As she reached for it, her fingers froze over the words printed neatly at the top:
Sage Institute Scholarship Referral for University Program.
Her eyes traveled lower.
At the bottom, in crisp ink—
Recipient: Edward Welton of Weshaven.
Her breath hitched.
&quot;...Edward?&quot; she said, quieter this time.
&quot;What?&quot; Eddie turned around, still adjusting the sleeve of his brown field jacket.
Mrs. Welton didn’t say anything at first. She just held up the letter.
The paper was heavier than standard parchment, its edges embroidered with intricate silver filigree. The ink, a deep, rich black, had been pressed so precisely into the page that it hadn’t faded with time. Stamped at the bottom in dark blue wax was the unmistakable insignia of the Sage Institute—one of the highest authorities on magical education.
&quot;This,&quot; Mrs. Welton said slowly, tilting the letter toward him, &quot;This is real. This is official. Care to explain what exactly it’s doing hidden under a pile of—” she gestured vaguely at the mess, “—whatever all this is?”
Eddie blinked. Then, as if a switch flipped in his mind, he let out a short chuckle. &quot;Oh, that?&quot; He rubbed the back of his head, offering an easy grin. &quot;That’s from long ago, remember? Gosh, I forgot how long ago that was. I think it’s from one of the competitions.&quot;
Mrs. Welton’s brows knitted together. &quot;Competitions?&quot;
&quot;You know,&quot; Eddie waved a hand dismissively, &quot;Alchemy Codex Decoding Tournament, potion-making contests, whatever you want to call them. I used to join a bunch back then.&quot;
&quot;You never told me you’ve got this.&quot;
Eddie hesitated for just a fraction of a second before shrugging, he was already turning back toward the door, grabbing his satchel as he moved. 
&quot;Look, it doesn’t matter now,&quot; he said, forcing an easygoing smile. &quot;I’m off with Torrie. Bye, Mum!&quot;
And before she could stop him, he slipped out the door.
Her lips pressed together, unreadable thoughts flickering behind her eyes as the floorboards creaked with Eddie’s retreating steps.
Mrs. Welton stood there for a long moment, the letter still in her hands, her eyes lingering on the name at the bottom.
Edward Welton of Weshaven.</Text>

CODEX SUBPLOT
Eddie met with the two scholars named Aenid and Hadir, they recognised him from Weshaven, and talked about the codex they got from Catherine. One of them argues that it might be Necromancy, but the other argues otherwise, 

	The scholars argues that no form of Magical Branch can seemingly do the technique described in the Codex, either they needed a Spellcraftsman to construct a new spell system to cast the spell described in the Codex, or else, they needed someone that can perform and understood Ancient Magic, which is debatable, since nobody would be alive today to know such a thing, not even Master Katarina

At the end, Eddie is going to steal the codex to learn the magic of Animation, that is breathing life or an illusion of life into something. But the magic of Animation is either taboo or forbidden, and it is said that the technique lies in the Codex Chilandar, the one codex kept secret by the Two Scholars

            <Title>Chapter 13E</Title>
            <Text>The heavy door to the lab swung shut, muffling the chaotic sounds of the firefight. In its place, a tense, echoing silence descended upon the holding pen, broken only by the electric flicker-buzz of a single, dying fluorescent light that swung gently overhead, casting long, dancing shadows.
The cages stood empty, their doors hanging open like silent, screaming mouths.
At opposite ends of the long corridor, Eddie and Walther faced each other. Walther, his face smudged with dirt and a trickle of blood from his temple, stood cloaked in black, the very image of the faceless goons now fighting Professor Hudson. The sight was so wrong, so utterly unbelievable, that for a moment, Eddie's mind refused to accept it.
Walther broke the silence, his voice laced with a cold, academic disappointment that was far more chilling than any shout. &quot;All that work,&quot; he said, casually brushing a speck of dust from his cloak. &quot;All those promising experimental subjects. You just let them walk away, Eddie.&quot;
The clinical, detached words snapped Eddie's shock into raw fury. &quot;They weren't 'subjects,' you sick bastard!&quot; he roared, his voice echoing off the tiled walls. &quot;They were people! Their faces are on the 'Missing' posters all over campus! They're the factory workers who didn't come home, the tourists who vanished! They were people!&quot;
Walther actually scoffed, a look of genuine pity on his face. &quot;They were subjects. We only took the unworthy dregs of Edenfield. The university dropouts, the drunks in the alleys, the homeless. People society had already thrown away. We were giving them a purpose.&quot;
&quot;A purpose?&quot; Eddie felt sick. &quot;And what about Madeleine? She was your classmate! Was she 'unworthy' too?&quot;
For the first time, a flicker of real anger crossed Walther's face. &quot;Madeleine,&quot; he scoffed, his voice dripping with contempt, &quot;The princess who refuses to take her father's throne.&quot;
Eddie stared, uncomprehending.
&quot;You didn't know?&quot; Walther gave a cruel, knowing smile. &quot;You didn't really think her name was 'Daedallia,' did you? Her father is Count Edgar the Third of the Northern Holdings. Her 'rebellion,' her choice to come here and play caretaker to broken animals instead of assuming her duties, was actively preventing the consolidation of Northern influence. She was single-handedly sabotaging 'The Grand Plan' just by breathing.&quot; 
Eddie had heard enough. He didn't know what the 'Grand Plan' was, and he didn't care. All he saw was the monster standing in his friend's skin, twisting reason into an excuse for atrocity.
&quot;You sicken me,&quot; he said, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous snarl.
He didn't wait for a reply. The rage and betrayal inside him ignited. A brilliant, violent green transmutation circle flared to life around his outstretched hand, bathing the grim corridor in its emerald light. There would be no more talk, no more explanations.
&quot;You're not walking out of here,&quot; Eddie vowed, and prepared to fight.

-==== BATTLE SCENE HERE =====-
Eddie basically loses at first, and then at the end he beats up Walther
-==== Battle Scene Ends ===-
The metallic serpent dissolved back into lifeless iron bars, clattering to the floor. Walther lay in a heap amidst the debris, clutching his shoulder, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Eddie stood over him, exhausted but victorious, the green glow of his alchemy fading from his hands. The distant sounds of the firefight in the lab were muffled, a world away from the ringing silence in the holding pen.
He had won.
A weak chuckle escaped Walther’s lips, bubbling up into a crazed, maniacal laugh that echoed eerily off the empty cages. &quot;You think... you think this changes anything?&quot; he coughed, a wild, feverish light in his eyes. &quot;You can't stop The Grand Plan, Eddie. It's too late! Its foundations were laid decades ago. Nothing... nothing can stop what's coming!&quot;
Fueled by his fanaticism, Walther pushed himself up against a cage, a triumphant, unhinged smirk twisting his face. &quot;Armies, Eddie!&quot; he declared, his voice growing stronger, more passionate. &quot;Armies of soldiers, each with the strength of a thousand men! A system that will finally purge the weakness from our society and bring prosperity and glory back to Solivia!&quot;
He threw his arms wide, his shadow dancing in the flickering light. &quot;No more will we be just another nation! Once more, the Empire of Solivia will rise from its ashes to rule the Archaean Archipelago, from Isgardia to the Eastern Dunes, just as we were always meant to be!&quot;
As his grand monologue reached its crescendo, he fumbled inside his torn cloak, his movements jerky and desperate. He produced a large syringe filled with a viscous, pulsing purple liquid.
Before Eddie could react, Walther jammed the needle into his own thigh, ramming the plunger down with a final, triumphant glare.
The effect was instantaneous and horrific.
Walther dropped the syringe and let out a deafening, inhuman roar of pure agony. His muscles began to spasm violently, bulging and tearing through the fabric of his black cloak. Veins bulged on his neck and arms, glowing with the same sickly purple light as the liquid. The sickening sound of cracking and elongating bone filled the narrow corridor as his body warped and twisted, his features distorting beyond recognition.
Eddie stumbled back, his exhaustion vanishing, replaced by a wave of sheer, primal horror. The man he knew was gone. In his place, a hulking, roaring beast was rising, no longer Walther Schroder, but a monster born of his own twisted ambition.

-==== Battle Phase 2 ====-
Eddie got his ass beat bruh
-==== Battle End ====-

The fight was a blur of brutality. The monstrous form of Walther was too fast, too strong. Eddie's alchemy, usually a precise instrument, was like throwing pebbles against a fortress. A single, contemptuous swipe from a clawed hand sent him flying. Before he could recover, a powerful kick connected with his chest, the force of it shattering his hastily formed alchemical shield and sending him crashing backward through a flimsy, rotten wooden door he hadn't even known was there.
He tumbled down a long flight of stone stairs, his body hitting the sharp edges with jarring, painful thuds, before landing in a heap on a dark, cold stone floor. A deep groan escaped his lips. Pain flared in his ribs, his back, his head. His body refused to move.
Where am I? he wondered, his vision swimming in the oppressive darkness. The air was cold and smelled of damp earth and decay.
Heavy, deliberate footsteps—the clacking of warped claws on stone—started down the stairs. A moment later, a switch was flipped, and harsh, bare bulbs flickered to life overhead, revealing the full horror of the room.
It was a basement. And it was full of cages. But the moaning creatures inside were not animals. Their limbs were stitched together, their bodies a horrifying amalgam of human parts and animal anatomy. The sight hit Eddie like a physical blow, throwing him back to that terrifying night on campus. This was the dumping ground for the project's failures.
A deep, monstrous laugh echoed from the stairs. &quot;Such a shame, Eddie,&quot; Walther's distorted voice boomed. &quot;You had so much potential. You would have made a powerful ally for The Cause.&quot;
Walther reached the bottom of the stairs and turned to a large, rusted lever on the wall. With a final, triumphant grin, he yanked it down.
A blaring alarm sounded, and with a simultaneous, deafening CLANG, the locks on every cage sprang open. The human-chimaera amalgamates spilled out, a shambling, moaning horde of pathetic and terrifying monsters, all turning their vacant, hungry eyes towards him.
Eddie lay helpless on the floor, his body broken, his energy gone. The creatures closed in, their grotesque forms shuffling slowly, inexorably closer. So this is how it ends, he thought, a wave of cold despair washing over him. Forgotten in a basement, torn apart by monsters made by a man I once called a friend. He closed his eyes, accepting his fate.
Just as the hot breath of the first creature washed over his face, a brilliant, concussive blast of golden light erupted from the top of the stairs. The monstrous form of Walther roared in pain and surprise as the spell slammed into his back. He stumbled forward, lost his footing, and tumbled gracelessly down the flight of stairs, landing in a huge, unmoving heap just feet from Eddie.
Eddie's eyes snapped open.
Silhouetted at the top of the stairs stood Madeleine, her face grim and determined, her staff still glowing from the spell she had just unleashed. Behind her stood Professor Hudson, his silver staff radiating immense power, and flanking him were two figures in the gleaming, polished steel of the Paladin Guard. The cavalry had arrived.
As the chimaeras began to refocus on Eddie, Hudson stepped forward. &quot;Welton, stay down!&quot; he commanded. He raised his staff high, and from it erupted a massive, fiery dragon-like apparition. The fire dragon swooped down into the basement, crashing onto the floor in a circle around Eddie, its body a wall of protective flame that incinerated the closest monsters and drove the rest back with terrifying force.
While the Paladins charged down the stairs, their own weapons glowing, to engage the remaining chimaeras, Madeleine rushed to Eddie's side. The ceiling above them lit up in strobing flashes of gold and crimson as spells fired, illuminating the grim, desperate scene below.
She knelt in the dirt beside him, her hand gently touching his cheek. &quot;Eddie? Eddie, can you hear me?&quot;
He was awake, just barely. His vision was a smear of light and shadow, the sounds of the battle a distant, roaring echo in his ears. He saw Madeleine's face swim into focus above him, her features etched with worry. Then another face appeared beside hers—Will, his usual smirk gone, replaced by raw concern.
&quot;Come on, mate,&quot; Will's voice cut through the haze. &quot;Up you get. Show's over.&quot;
Madeleine and Will hooked their arms under his, lifting him from the cold stone floor. The pain was immense, but it was a distant, secondary sensation. He was numb, floating. They supported him on either side, a human crutch, and began the slow, arduous journey back up the stairs.
The world was a blur. The sharp, concussive sounds of the firefight were muffled, as if he were underwater. Flashes of light were all he could see of the battle. As they emerged back into the laboratory, the scene had been utterly transformed. The once sterile, hostile room was now a hive of controlled, official activity. Figures in the crisp navy blue of the Edenfield Police moved purposefully. Paladins in gleaming white armour stood guard. Medics in white robes were tending to the freed captives, wrapping them in warm blankets and murmuring words of comfort.
Through his swimming vision, Eddie saw the faces of the people he had helped free—scared, yes, but safe. They were being cared for. They were out. A small, faint smile touched his lips. It was worth it.
&quot;Eddie? Hey, stay with us.&quot; Ashley's voice, sharp and clear, tried to pull him back. She was walking backward in front of them, her eyes locked on his.
&quot;Just a bit further, Eddie,&quot; Madeleine urged, her grip tightening on his arm.
&quot;Don't you dare pass out on us now, buddy,&quot; Will added, his attempt at humour undercut by the strain in his voice. &quot;The paperwork would be a nightmare.&quot;
He tried to respond, to tell them he was okay, but the words wouldn't form. The edges of his vision began to darken, the bright lights of the lab blurring into indistinct, shimmering halos. The voices of his friends grew distant, echoing as if from the end of a long tunnel.
The last thing he saw was Madeleine's worried face, her mouth moving, before the light, the sound, and the world faded entirely to black.

            <Title>Chapter 17</Title>
            <Text>As Markus and Catherine went outside the perimeter of the Eden Flowers, Eddie and Torrie settled down at the side of the Traveller’s Path. The glowing Eden Flowers cast a gentle, golden light over the path, creating a serene atmosphere amidst the dense darkness of the Deep Glaive. 
Eddie sat next to Torrie on the edge of the path, his gaze fixed on the flickering lights of the Eden Flowers. On the other hand, Torrie focused on a more delicate task. She deftly wove Eden Flowers into a crown, her small fingers moving with practised ease.
 “So, Torrie,” Eddie began, filling the silence. “How do you feel about seeing Catherine again?”
Torrie looked up from her flower crown.
“I’m happy.” She said, “Not every day you meet someone with so much knowledge and experience. Aunt Catherine has travelled far and studied so much. Being able to learn from her is fascinating.”
“Yeah,” Eddie flashed a faint smile “it’s... good to see her again.”
Torrie’s smile widened slightly but didn’t reach her eyes as much as before. 
“And what about you? How do you feel about meeting her again?”
“It’s alright.”
“Just that?” Torrie’s smile faltered, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Eddie’s face.  “Nothing else fascinates you about her return?”
Eddie’s smile faded, and he looked away, his expression suddenly distant.
“It’s just... seeing her again is... cool… She’s awesome.” Eddie replied. He glanced at Torrie, whose previously bright demeanour had now shifted to something more serious.
Torrie’s eyes searched his face, her gaze intense. “Are you telling me that’s all there is to it? You don’t feel anything else about her returning after all this time?”
Eddie shifted uncomfortably. “It’s not like that. I just... I don’t know.”
Torrie’s smile had vanished entirely, replaced by a frown of concern and confusion. “Eddie, I thought you’d be more... interested. You used to look up to her so much when we were young!”
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the side, avoiding her piercing gaze. “Maybe. I don’t know.”
Torrie’s fingers paused mid-motion with the flower crown, her face a mask of frustration and somewhat hurt.
The Eden Flowers glowed softly. Their light cast long shadows that danced across their faces. The once-comforting glow now seemed to highlight the distance growing between them.
Torrie finally broke the silence, her voice quiet but firm. “If you’re not interested in seeing what’s different, then...” Her voice ceded down
 “why are you even here?”

-o-

The moonlight pierced through the dense canopy of the Deep Glaive, casting jagged patterns across the forest floor. Twisted vines and ancient trees loomed like sentinels, their gnarled forms seeming almost alive in the shifting light. The forest was oppressively silent, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant, haunting call of some unseen creature. 

Catherine walked through the darkness of the forest, lit up by a white glow she conjured from her staff, Markus is following behind her, his grip tight on Eddie’s flintlock rifle. The weapon was raised, its polished barrel glinting faintly in the pale light. Every whisper of movement sent his heart racing, his eyes darting toward every shadow. At the slightest rustle of a bush, the rifle twitched in his hands, his finger hovering dangerously close to the trigger. 

“You haven’t answered my question, Markus.” Catherine said, her eyes still forward.

“Look, ma’am. I’m here because Eddie clearly don’t want to!” Markus groaned, “In fact, I’m clearly a better shot than he is!” 

“But you clearly looked scared,” Catherine said, brushing the bushes out of her way with her staff, “You’re holding that thing like we’re about to be ambushed by an army of bandits.” 

“Easy for you to joke, ma’am!” Markus lowered the rifle but kept it ready. “You’ve got magic and stuff! I’ve got only this—and it’s not exactly comforting.” He gave the rifle a wary look as if it might betray him at any moment. 

“We’ll be fine.” Catherine said, her voice quiet but steady. “I’ve been through worse, believe me. And I promise you, we won’t be facing it alone if anything comes at us. Beasts this centuries tend to be much more smaller in size, so it will be a piece of cake.”

 “Alright,” he muttered. “One centuries old or one week old, I’m still keeping this thing ready.”  

They continued deeper into the forest. The silence between them seemed to press in even closer, distant howls and rustles of bushes are the only thing they could hear, the darkness growing thicker. Catherine kept her senses sharp, but sensing Markus’s unease, she knows he needed something to keep his mind off his surroundings.

“You know,” she began, her tone conversational, “I used to visit Eddie’s home a lot when he was younger. We’d go adventuring in ancient dungeons, exploring caves and abandoned ruins. But an illusory forest is definitely first for me in ages.” 

“Really?” Markus glanced at her, his face pale. “Yeah, I remember Eddie used to talk a lot about his adventures in the dungeons, that was what made him quite popular at school.” 

“Was he now?” Catherine chuckled. “Eddie used to love going off the path, treading the path uncharted. He was always adventurous, seeking new experiences, no matter the danger.”

“We’d found ourselves in trouble countless times,” Catherine continued, “But Eddie always seemed to enjoy the thrill of it. His older brother Alfred and I often had to help him out of those troubles he got himself in.” 

“Yeah…” Markus said, “That was also the Eddie I remembered, he’s so reckless, even when he was school.”

“Hm?” Catherine said, curious, “You talk as if we are talking about two different person. What’s the matter with the Eddie we are with now?”

“Eddie now...” Markus sighed,  “He seems different. He doesn’t seem like the same person.” 

“Different? “Catherine’s smile faded slightly as she looked at Markus. “How so?” 

“Didn’t you know he was expelled?”

“Expelled?” Catherine said, “From Aella Academy?”

Markus nodded.

“How can he be?” Catherine asked, “He is the prodigy of your year wasn’t he? Or so what Alyssa told me in her letters.”

“He was…” Markus said, “Until one day… he was so reckless…”

Both of them continues to walk, the howls and unnerving chirps of different creatures continue to sound. 

“Back at the academy,” Markus began, “A kid named Davies used to heavily bully me. I wasn’t as adept at magic as the others, so I was an easy target. Eddie was always my friend because he didn’t quite fit in, people are jealous of him. He’d spend time with me instead of those other guys. Because maybe I didn’t bear the same resentment like the other guys.” 

Markus paused, his eyes reflecting the dim light conjured by Catherine. “One day, when me and Eddie hang out, Davies was especially brutal. Thinking who am I to leech off the prodigy. Davies challenged me to a Duel, but I was no match for him. Eddie was there. He was impulsive, as he always was, and he challenged Davies instead.”

“None of us knew how it would end. Davies didn’t take Eddie seriously, Eddie was an Alchemy student, and Alchemy is not much for Duelling, compared to Davies who is a Conjuration student. But during the duel, Eddie scarred Davies’ face. It was a mess, and Eddie got expelled from the academy.” 

“Scarred?” Catherine asked, “Alchemy… couldn’t scar someone directly. Were both of them battle in the class room?”

“No,” Markus said, “It was in the woods just like this, there is no metal for him to transmute. The Aella Council deemed that it was black magic Eddie was using, he was expelled to avoid scandals.”

“I had no idea…” Catherine’s expression shifted from curiosity to shock and sympathy. “Eddie never spoke about it. I’ve always wondered why he seemed so distant.” 

“It was a turning point for him.” Markus nodded, his gaze dropping. “He became cold and withdrawn from the very thing he was passionate about. From that point forward, he thought Alchemy was black magic, he burned all of his Alchemy textbooks, donated his uniform. It’s like he lost everything that is important to him.” 

“That’s why…” Markus continued, “I’m here. Because at least I want to give back to him, to at least show him that I can at least protect him back, he don’t need to go out into danger anymore.”

Catherine didn’t respond… She continues walking, thinking that her initial thought regarding Eddie’s distant behaviour was correct. It is not like he had lost something important to him.

He did lost something important… in which it made him lost himself.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 11</Title>
            <Text>The door towards the garage creaked open, the lights from the main room streaked through as Eddie paced his way inside.
The garage was dimly lit, the only light coming from a small lantern hanging above the workbench. It smelt of old wood, tools and equipment lined the walls. A rusty beaten-down car sat on the corner, the automobile definitely hadn’t ran for ages. The sounds of metal clinking and leather straps fastened filled the space as he checked and rechecked each item with meticulous care.
&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; Eddie muttered under his breath. His fingers ran over bandoliers, satchels, and tools he hadn't touched in years. 
Eddie’s eyes landed on one particular satchel, a worn leather satchel that he hasn’t touched in years.
He took the satchel and opened it.
He adjusted the straps of a worn leather satchel. &quot;An illusory forest,&quot; he scoffed. &quot;Because, sure, Catherine, that’s exactly where I want to take Torrie. Nothing says 'quality family time with Markus' like trudging through a place that’s basically a trap pretending to be nature. Brilliant idea.&quot;
His hands moved faster now, checking the buckles. 
&quot;And she just assumes we’ll be fine. No map, no plan, just a wave of her hand and a 'Oh, it’ll be fine! It's perfectly safe!' Perfectly safe, my arse. Since when is anywhere safe when it’s been illusory forest to confuse you, lure you into dead ends, or worse? What next? A quick detour into a cave full of angry wyverns? Maybe invite a banshee for tea while we’re at it?&quot;
The lantern above him swayed slightly, casting jittery shadows on the walls as his agitation grew. 
&quot;She doesn’t even think about this stuff, does she? Of course not. It's all, 'Eddie, you’re overreacting!' Overreacting? When I’m the one who has to make sure Torrie doesn’t get eaten by whatever it is lurking in the bushes.&quot;
The satchel finally settled into place with a heavy thud, and he reached for a pair of gloves, inspecting them for wear. 
&quot;And Markus—poor Markus—dragged into this because he just happened to be standing there when Catherine got this harebrained idea. What was he going to say? 'No, thanks, I’d rather not risk my life today'? She doesn’t exactly leave room for discussion, does she?&quot;
He exhaled sharply, the sound halfway between a sigh and a growl, and raked his fingers through his hair. &quot;Ridiculous. Absolutely, unequivocally ridiculous.&quot;
As the heavy door creaked open, Eddie spun around, expecting Catherine or, worse, Torrie coming to ask some inane question about how much longer he was going to be. 
Instead, it was Mr. Robert Welton.
“Oh hey there, Son.” Robert chuckled, on his sides are satchels filled with alchemical ingredients, he goes to one of the workbench and settle it down, it settles with a very heavy thud. He then looked at Eddie, “What’re you up to?”
“It’s just…” Eddie said, his hands scraping the leather of his satchel, “Catherine.”
“Catherine?” Robert raised his eyebrow. “Oh are you going to your little adventures?”
“Well, maybe a little is an understatement.” Eddie chuckled, leaning to one of the workbench, “She also invited Torrie and Markus.”
“A big party?!” Robert whistled, walking towards Eddie and pats him in the back “You guys got  a big adventure ahead of ya!”
“Yeah, I suppose we are.” Eddie chuckled
“Stay safe, son.” Robert finally said
“I will, dad.” Eddie said, putting his satchel on, and walking towards the door. But before he could turn and twist it.
“Eddie.” Robert called
“Yes, dad?”
“Are you going to take your ring with you?”
Eddie stood there, looking below.
“No, I gave the ring to Torrie years ago.”
“I see.” Robert said, his expression becoming more sombre, “Then come here for a sec.”
Eddie then walked from the door, joining his father on the workbench.
“It should be somewhere around here…” Robert said, rummaging through his chest, taking out all sort of tools, hammers, fishing rods, axes, until
“Ah, there she is!” Robert said in glee, and from the chest, there is a Flintlock Rifle
“Alfred’s gun?” Eddie said, raising his eyebrow.
“My gun, before I gave this to Alfred, and since he is away overseas nobody has used it ever since.” Robert said
“And what do you want me to do with it?” 
“Let’s see whether you still know how to use ‘em.” He said, then tossing the rifle to Eddie, in which he catches it. “Go on, do you still remember how to load the thing?”
Eddie reached for a small metal ball from the other satchel without a word, loading the flintlock with practised ease. His movements were fluid and confident as if the muscle memory had never left him. He secured the powder, placed the ball in the barrel, and snapped the mechanism into place. When he finished, he looked up at his father. 
Robert smiled. &quot;Alright, I suppose you still remember. I'd rather you take your ring with you, but if you insist on not using it, at least you can defend yourself. Now disengage it, Edward.&quot; 
Eddie then slinged Alfred’s rifle on his back, then took the other satchel, containing gun powders and metal balls. &quot;Yeah, I suppose so.&quot; 
There was a brief silence, the weight of unspoken words hanging between them. Finally, Robert clapped his hand on Eddie's shoulder, his grip firm. &quot;Alright then. Be safe out there, Ed. Keep Torrie safe out there, alright?&quot;
Eddie met his father's gaze, the flintlock resting comfortably at his gack. &quot;I sure will.&quot;
As Robert turned to leave, Eddie watched him go, feeling the rifle's weight in his hands. It wasn't the same as carrying a wand, but perhaps that was the point. The door closed behind his father with a soft thud, leaving Eddie alone in the garage's quiet. 

-o-

	Eddie stepped out of the garage, Flintlock rifle slung across his back and two satchels secured at his sides, one leather, containing his personal stuff, the other is a canvas satchel, containing his ammunition. The morning air was cool, slightly obscured by the morning fog. Muted grey painted the sky. Outside, Catherine and Torrie stood near the low stone wall overlooking the sea, Catherine is leaning on the stone wall. Their figures bathed in the fading light. 
	Torrie, her eyes wide with excitement, was practically bouncing on her heels as she bombarded Catherine with a flurry of questions about magic. Her silver-jade conduit ring bouncing on her metal chains on her neck as she talk. 
	&quot;Catherine, Catherine! Could you transmute copper into gas if you added enough heat and pressure? Or would it just destabilize like Eddie’s brilliant idea last week? You know, the one that nearly made the whole living room smell like burnt hair and vinegar for days?&quot;
	&quot;Well, Torrie, theoretically, yes, you could, but transmuting metals on that scale requires an extraordinary amount of precision—far more than most Alchemists can safely handle. And Eddie’s experiment wasn’t entirely off-base,&quot; she added with a faint smile, glancing at him. 
	Markus, meanwhile, leaned casually against the stone wall. His gaze fixed on the sea as the waves gently lapped against the shore below. He looked up as Eddie approached, a grin spreading across his face.
	&quot;All set, Ed?&quot; Markus asked. Pushing himself off the wall.
	Eddie nodded. &quot;Yeah, I'm ready.&quot; 
	As Eddie joined them, Catherine's eyes were drawn immediately to the rifle on his back. Her brows furrowed in surprise, a stark contrast to the warm smile she had been wearing. &quot;Eddie, what is that?&quot; 
	“Dad asked me to carry it.” Eddie said, straightening the flintlock on his back, “For protections, of course.”
	“Why not use your usual ring?” Catherine said
Eddie stood there, “I uhh,”
“Eddie gave the ring to me.” Torrie said, “I’ll be using the ring.”
“Well that’s a disappointment,” Catherine sighed. She studied him longer, searching for the boy she remembered in the man before her. &quot;I see... Well, I suppose a bit of extra protection never hurt anyone.&quot; 
She then stepped closer, her scholarly curiosity piqued. &quot;May I?&quot; she asked, touching the rifle. 
Eddie quickly swatted her hand away, a playful smile tugging at his lips despite his tension. &quot;No, can't do, Ma'am. Dad said nobody else should touch it besides me and my brother Alfred.&quot;
Catherine pouted. Folding her arms, sulking playfully. &quot;Hmph, and here I thought I'd get to examine something new. Very well, I suppose I'll just have to content myself with the mysteries of the Deep Glaive.&quot;
Torrie giggled at the exchange, and even Markus couldn't help but chuckle. Eddie shook his head, still smiling, as he adjusted the strap of his satchel.
Catherine regained her usual demeanour, though a hint of amusement lingered in her eyes. &quot;Alright, let's get going. The Deep Glaive waits for no one.&quot;
The group began to make their way down the path leading away from the house. Catherine walked at the front, her staff clicking rhythmically against the cobblestones. Torrie followed closely behind, practically skipping with every step. Markus and Eddie brought up the rear, with Eddie casting one last glance back at the house where his father stood watching from the doorway.
Mr and Mrs Welton raised a hand in a silent farewell, his expression a mix of pride and concern. Eddie returned the gesture before turning away.

            <Text>

1. Frequency (Pitch)
What it is: Frequency determines the pitch of a sound, from low (bass) to high (treble).
How it works in Bardry:
Lower frequencies could create physical vibrations, shaking the ground or shattering objects.
Higher frequencies might affect the mind, inducing emotions like calm, fear, or euphoria.
Mastery of frequency could allow bards to &quot;tune&quot; their magic to specific targets, like disrupting an enemy’s thoughts or resonating with a material to break it.

2. Amplitude (Volume)
What it is: Amplitude determines the loudness or intensity of a sound.
How it works in Bardry:
Soft sounds could be used for subtle effects, like whispering a lullaby to put someone to sleep.
Loud sounds could be weaponized, creating sonic booms or deafening enemies.
Amplitude could also represent the scale of the magic—quiet spells for small effects, loud spells for large-scale destruction.

3. Timbre (Tone Color)
What it is: Timbre is the quality or &quot;color&quot; of a sound, which distinguishes different instruments or voices even when they play the same note.
How it works in Bardry:
Different timbres could evoke different magical effects. For example:
A flute’s airy tone might summon wind or create illusions.
A drum’s deep resonance might strengthen allies or weaken enemies.
A violin’s sharp tone might cut through barriers or emotions.
Bards could specialize in specific instruments to access unique abilities.

4. Rhythm (Tempo and Pattern)
What it is: Rhythm is the pattern of sounds in time, including tempo (speed) and beat.
How it works in Bardry:
Fast rhythms could energize allies, speeding up their movements or thoughts.
Slow rhythms could slow down enemies or create a sense of heaviness.
Complex rhythms might be used for intricate spells, like weaving multiple effects together.
Rhythmic patterns could also be used to encode messages or spells in music.

5. Harmony (Combination of Sounds)
What it is: Harmony is the combination of different notes played or sung together to create chords.
How it works in Bardry:
Harmonizing sounds could amplify magical effects, creating powerful synergies.
Discordant sounds (dissonance) might disrupt magic or cause chaos.
Bards could work together, harmonizing their spells to achieve greater results.
Harmony could also represent balance—using sound to restore order or heal.

Additional Ideas for Bardry:
Resonance: Bards could use resonance to amplify their magic by matching the natural frequency of objects or beings. For example, resonating with a stone wall to shatter it or with a person’s heartbeat to heal them.
Sonic Constructs: Advanced bards might shape sound into physical forms, like creating barriers of solid sound or weapons made of pure vibration.
Emotional Manipulation: Music is deeply tied to emotion. Bards could use their magic to inspire courage, sow fear, or even manipulate memories through song.
Environmental Interaction: Sound travels differently in different environments (e.g., echoing in caves, muffled in forests). Bards could use this to their advantage, adapting their magic to the terrain.

Example Bardry Spells:
Sonic Boom: A loud, concentrated burst of sound that knocks back enemies.
Lullaby of Slumber: A soft, rhythmic melody that puts listeners to sleep.
Resonant Shield: A harmonic barrier that deflects attacks by vibrating at the frequency of incoming projectiles.
Song of Healing: A soothing melody that accelerates natural healing processes.
Discordant Blast: A jarring, dissonant sound that disrupts enemy spells or concentration.

Progression in Bardry:
Novice Bards: Can manipulate basic frequencies and amplitudes, creating simple effects like loud noises or calming tones.
Adept Bards: Can control timbre and rhythm, using specific instruments or patterns to achieve more complex effects.
Master Bards: Can harmonize multiple elements of sound, creating powerful synergies or shaping sound into physical forms.
Grandmaster Bards: Can manipulate all five elements of Bardry with precision, using sound to alter reality itself.

            <Title>[REV] Chapter 3</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stepped off the ferry first, tossing a few coins to the ferryman before helping Torrie down onto the sturdy wooden planks of Osthaven’s dock. The air here was different—crisper, drier. Less of that thick, briny scent of fish that clung to Weshaven. Instead, the harbour was filled with the rich aromas of spice crates being unloaded, the earthy scent of dried herbs, and the occasional whiff of parchment and ink from merchants tallying their stock.
Osthaven was busier in a different way. Where Weshaven had the steady rhythm of fishermen mending nets and unloading the morning’s catch, Osthaven hummed with the brisk efficiency of trade. Men and women haggled over silk and spices from distant lands, warehouse workers hauled crates marked with foreign sigils, and couriers darted between carts carrying letters sealed with wax.
Torrie took it all in, wide-eyed. “It’s… bigger than I thought.”
Eddie smirked. “Told you. Less fish guts, more commerce.”
They moved through the streets, weaving past merchants arranging their displays and scholars in robes, their arms laden with books. As they walked, Eddie found his eyes drifting, the familiar streets pulling at old memories.
As they walked through the bustling streets of Osthaven, Eddie gestured toward a small stall by the corner, where the scent of roasted chestnuts wafted through the air.
&quot;See that?&quot; Eddie said, nudging Torrie. &quot;Markus and I used to stop there after classes. We'd split a bag of chestnuts and complain about assignments the whole way home.&quot;
Torrie looked over, her nose scrunching slightly. &quot;You two really bonded over complaining, huh?&quot;
Eddie smirked. &quot;It's an art form, I tell you.&quot;
They continued down the road, past the colorful stalls of cloth merchants, until Eddie’s gaze landed on a narrow shop with a faded green awning.
&quot;And that place,&quot; he pointed, &quot;Was where I used to get supplies for my... projects.&quot;
Torrie raised an eyebrow. &quot;What kind of 'projects'?&quot;
Eddie chuckled. &quot;Alchemy, mostly. The owner—grumpiest old man you'd ever meet—used to grumble about every single request I made, but he never actually turned me away.&quot;
Torrie grinned. &quot;Sounds like he liked you.&quot;
Eddie scoffed, shaking his head. “I think he just liked my coins.”
Eddie slowed slightly, his fingers brushing against the strap of his bag. It was strange, being back. The town hadn’t changed much, but everything felt different now.
Torrie noticed his lingering gaze. “You’ve been here a lot, huh?”
Eddie gave a small nod, exhaling softly. “Yeah… long ago.”
Torrie smiled. “Well, now I’m here too.”
Eddie chuckled, shaking off the weight of nostalgia. “Yeah. Let’s get you to Aella.”

-o-

Eddie pedaled through the last stretch of road, the cobbled streets of Osthaven giving way to packed dirt as they left the bustle of town behind. Fields of golden hay swayed gently in the morning breeze, stretching far and wide, their soft rustling the only sound accompanying them now.
And then, past the gentle slope of the hill, Aella Academy came into view.
It stood just as Eddie remembered—tall, sturdy, with its weathered stone walls and a modest courtyard nestled at its center. It wasn’t the grandest school in Solivia, not the kind spoken of in hushed reverence like Edenfield, but around here, it was everything. A place of learning, discipline, and quiet ambition.
Eddie slowed the bike to a stop near the front gate. Torrie hopped off, adjusting her satchel, her eyes gleaming as she took in the sight before her.
“Well,” she said, turning to him, a wide grin breaking across her face, “I guess this is it.”
 “You’ll do fine, Torrie.” Eddie said, forcing a small smirk. “You better not cause too much trouble.”
She stuck her tongue out playfully before stepping forward, her pace quickening until she was practically skipping through the front gate.
Eddie lingered by the entrance, watching her go. 
He saw himself in her.
The same eagerness, the same restless energy that had carried him through these very gates years ago. He remembered what it was like, standing on the threshold of something new, looking ahead and seeing only possibility.
Now, he stood on the other side of it.
Eddie let out a quiet breath, gripping the handles a little tighter before shaking his head.
“Go get ‘em, Torrie.”
And with that, he turned the bike around and started pedaling back towards town.

-o-

Eddie pedaled steadily through the streets of Osthaven, the hum of the town buzzing around him. The salty breeze had thinned, replaced by the scent of fresh bread, spices, and something sweet roasting over an open flame. His stomach reminded him, with a low grumble, that breakfast had been hurried.
He slowed to a stop near a familiar stall, the one that sold honeyed almonds and sesame biscuits. The sight alone pulled him back to old routines—grabbing a bag for himself, an extra for Markus. It had been a while, but some habits never quite faded.
After paying the vendor, he stepped back toward his bicycle, ready to sling the bag over the handlebars—when something caught his eye.
A building stood across the street, its architecture different from the others around it. Age clung to its stone walls, yet the towering columns bore intricate carvings, their shapes unmistakably Elvish. Time had weathered them, but their elegance remained, a relic of a bygone era.
Above the heavy wooden doors, an emblem was set in iron: an owl, perched upon a scroll, wings tucked close. Beneath it, carved into the worn brass plaque, were two simple words.
Sage Institute.
Eddie stared, something stirring in his chest. He hadn’t noticed it before—maybe he had never cared to look. But now, standing there, it felt like the building was watching him back.
Eyes tracing the contours of the emblem, Eddie lingered a moment longer, the owl’s unblinking gaze seeming almost knowing. The Sage Institute. He knew nothing about it—had never needed to—but something about it gnawed at the edges of his mind. A curiosity, fleeting yet persistent.
With a breath, he shook it off, tucking the bag of snacks securely inside his satchel before turning back to his bicycle. The world outside his thoughts rushed back in—the chatter of merchants, the rhythmic clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the occasional call of dockworkers hauling cargo.
He swung a leg over the bike and pushed off, weaving through the streets of Osthaven with practiced ease. The town passed him by in a blur of nostalgia and familiarity, but his mind remained half elsewhere, lingering on the building, on the emblem, on the feeling.
The distant chime of a bell tower reminded him of the time. He wasn’t in a hurry, but he didn’t want to miss the next ferry back to Weshaven either.
By the time he reached the harbor, the ferry was already boarding. He rolled his bicycle up the gangway, found a quiet spot near the railing, and exhaled, letting the sea breeze wash over him.
Back to Weshaven. Back to his routines.

-o-

Eddie stepped off the ferry, the lingering scent of salt and fish clinging to his coat as he pedaled back through the familiar streets of Weshaven. The town moved at its usual pace—fishermen hauling in their morning catches, merchants calling out their wares, the rhythmic hammering of shipwrights at work. It felt routine, but his thoughts still lingered on Osthaven, on Aella, on the emblem of the owl perched on a scroll.
By the time he reached the apothecary, the comforting scent of herbs and simmering potions greeted him like an old friend. He pushed open the wooden door and stepped into the brewing room, where golden light streamed through the lofty windows, casting long, shifting shadows.
A deep but gentle voice called out from the far end of the room, its warmth filling the space like the heat of a hearth.
&quot;Morning, Edward!&quot;
Markus stood hunched over his workstation, his broad frame making the desk seem almost too small for him. His wild curls peeked out from under his cap, and a faint flush colored his round cheeks—likely from standing over boiling cauldrons all morning. 
He was a large presence in every sense, but his movements were measured, careful, and full of practiced ease as he stirred a simmering mixture, his huge hands treating delicate ingredients with surprising gentleness.
Eddie smirked and reached into his satchel. &quot;Got you something.&quot;
Markus glanced up, his dark eyes curious as Eddie handed over a small paper bag. A familiar scent wafted from within.
&quot;You didn’t,&quot; Markus breathed, opening the bag to reveal golden-brown roasted chestnuts. His expression flickered between delight and nostalgia.
&quot;Stopped by the old stall,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;Figured you’d appreciate it.&quot;
&quot;You really do know how to make a guy’s morning.&quot; Markus chuckled, popping one into his mouth and sighing contentedly. &quot;So, how’d it go? With Torrie, I mean.&quot;
&quot;Good. Aella still looks like Aella.&quot; Eddie exhaled, glancing past Markus as if he could still see the academy in the distance. &quot;Nothing much has changed since we were there.&quot;
Markus hummed, a small smile tugging at his lips. &quot;I bet she was buzzing with excitement.&quot;
&quot;Practically skipping through the gates,&quot; Eddie admitted with a chuckle.
Markus laughed, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, that sounds about right.&quot; He rolled up his sleeves, returning his focus to the potion before him. &quot;She’s gonna do great there, you know. Always knew she had it in her.&quot;
Eddie didn’t respond immediately, just nodded, watching the steam rise from Markus’s cauldron.
For a moment, it was like old times.
Eddie had just popped a chestnut into his mouth when Markus spoke, his voice casual but laced with meaning.
“Oh, by the way—Mr. Welton wants to see you earlier.”
Eddie froze mid-chew. A slow, creeping realization dawned on him.
He was supposed to hand over the formula today.
“Damn it—I forgot!” He shot upright,  swallowed hard, nearly choking. nearly knocking over a stack of parchment on the counter.
“Yeah, figured.” Markus raised an amused brow, still munching on his snack. “He’s already up at the tower.”
Cursing under his breath, Eddie spun on his heel and bolted toward the stairs. His boots thudded against the wooden steps as he rushed to his desk, rummaging through scattered notes, ink-stained pages, and unfinished drafts. Where the hell was it?
He shoved aside a worn-out alchemy textbook, and there it was—the carefully scribed formula, buried beneath a pile of old scribbles.
Snatching it up, he didn’t waste another second. He turned on his heel and sprinted towards the tower, heart pounding.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1.5E</Title>
            <Text>The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime, and Eddie, Will, and Ashley stepped out into the quiet hallway, their playful banter still going strong.
“I’m just saying,” Will continued, gesturing dramatically, “if she doesn’t love my sculpting tools, then clearly her taste is broken.”
Ashley rolled her eyes. “Right, because nothing says heartfelt like, ‘Here’s something to remind you of work.’ At least my pastries will make her smile.”
“And my tea—” Eddie began, but his words faltered mid-sentence as he caught sight of something down the hall.
Three figures in black hooded cloaks stood a short distance away, their backs turned toward the trio. The hallway’s dim lighting only added to their ominous appearance, the fabric of their cloaks shifting slightly as if caught in a breeze that didn’t exist. One of the figures, taller than the others, held a small satchel, while the others appeared to exchange whispered words, their voices too low to catch.
The group instinctively slowed their steps, the air around them suddenly feeling heavier.
“Uh... is that normal?” Ashley whispered, breaking the uneasy silence. Her eyes flicked between the cloaked figures and her friends. “Do people here just... dress like that?”
Eddie and Will exchanged a glance. “Not a clue,” Will muttered, his earlier bravado tempered by the unease creeping into his tone.
Eddie shifted the tin of tea in his hands, his gaze lingering on the figures for a moment longer. “Let’s just... mind our own business,” he said, his voice firm but quiet. “Madeleine’s room isn’t far. Let’s go.”
“Agreed,” Ashley said, though her voice carried a note of tension. She pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders, as if to shield herself from the discomfort of the situation.
They walked in silence, their earlier levity forgotten. Eddie’s mind churned with questions. Who were these people? Why were they here? He glanced back briefly but saw no change in the figures’ posture—they seemed more focused on whatever conversation they were having than on the trio.
Still, unease gnawed at him. The Northern District was a grand, elegant part of the city, but it didn’t feel as inviting as the bustling streets of the university district or the familiar simplicity of Weshaven. The grandeur here came with shadows, and tonight, those shadows seemed a little darker than usual.
Ashley broke the silence as they approached another corridor. “Maybe they’re just performers or something,” she said, her tone forced and nervous. “Some kind of... local theater group?”
“Yeah,” Will said, trying to inject humor into his voice, though it came out strained. “And their play’s called ‘How to Make People Uncomfortable.’”
Eddie didn’t laugh. He glanced at the room numbers on the doors, focusing on finding Madeleine’s apartment. The sooner they were inside, the better.
The hallway felt narrower than it should have been, the silence between Eddie, Will, and Ashley stretching like a taut string ready to snap. Their earlier laughter and banter had evaporated, leaving behind the oppressive weight of the cloaked figures’ presence. The sound of their footsteps—soft taps against the polished stone floor—seemed unnaturally loud in the quiet.
Eddie kept his gaze fixed ahead, the scrap of paper with Madeleine’s room number clutched tightly in his hand. &quot;Just keep walking,&quot; he muttered under his breath, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;We don’t have business with them.&quot;
Will, uncharacteristically quiet, nodded, his hands shoved into his jacket pockets. Ashley, walking slightly behind them, cast glances over her shoulder, her brows furrowed. “I swear, they’re not even trying to be subtle,” she murmured, her voice tight. “Why would anyone dress like that in the middle of the night?”
“Doesn’t matter,” Eddie replied quickly. “They’re not here for us. Just... play it cool.”
But the air around them refused to cool. It buzzed with an unspoken tension, each step feeling heavier than the last. The three figures ahead walked slowly, deliberately, their movements synchronized in an unsettling way. The tallest one, the one with the satchel, glanced briefly over their shoulder, causing Eddie’s heart to leap into his throat. He forced himself to keep his eyes forward, pretending to focus on the hallway numbers.
Ashley muttered something under her breath, too quiet for Eddie to hear, but the nervous edge in her tone was unmistakable. Will, for once, didn’t have a joke or a quip to ease the mood. Instead, he stayed close to Eddie, his hands flexing at his sides as if unsure whether to relax or prepare for something worse.
Finally, they reached Madeleine’s room at the end of the hallway. Eddie recognized the door immediately—its polished surface bore a brass plaque engraved with her room number. Relief began to creep into his chest, the first real reprieve since stepping off the elevator. All they had to do was knock, and they’d be inside. Safe.
Eddie raised his hand, ready to rap on the door.
But as his knuckles hovered just inches from the wood, the faint shuffle of footsteps stopped behind him.
His breath caught. Slowly, almost unwillingly, Eddie turned his head to look.
The three cloaked figures had also stopped—right in front of Madeleine’s door.
It was as if time itself paused, the only sound the faint hum of the hallway’s lighting. Eddie’s heart pounded in his ears, drowning out all rational thought.
The silence between them was suffocating, thick with the unspoken threat hanging in the air. Eddie’s heart raced, the pounding in his chest growing louder than the hushed whispers of the others. He stood frozen in front of the door, every muscle tense, every instinct screaming for him to move, to do something, but his feet remained rooted to the floor. Will and Ashley stood beside him, equally alert, but he could see the unease in their eyes.
The tallest figure broke the silence with a low, almost mocking voice. “Ah,” he said, the word dragging on with a chill in his tone, “What do we have here?”
Eddie’s jaw tightened. His throat felt dry, but he forced himself to speak, trying to keep his voice steady. &quot;What do you want?&quot; His words came out clipped, though a hint of fear lingered behind them.
The tallest figure smiled, the expression barely discernible under the shadow of his hood. It wasn’t a smile of warmth—it was cold, calculating. &quot;We have no business with you, young man.&quot; His tone was smooth, like polished marble, but the undertone carried a weight that made Eddie’s stomach twist. &quot;However, we do have business with Miss Daedallia.&quot;
The female figure moved subtly, a flicker of motion under her cloak, her hand reaching for something—likely a dagger. Eddie’s breath caught in his throat, and his eyes flickered to her hand, but before she could unsheath it, the tallest one raised a hand in a slow, deliberate gesture. It was an almost imperceptible motion, but the command was clear. She paused, her fingers lingering on the hilt before retracting her hand.
“No need for such measures,” the tallest one continued, his voice never rising, never losing its eerie calm. &quot;This need not turn ugly.&quot;
Eddie’s pulse quickened, his mind racing. The dread creeping up his spine became a solid weight in his chest. His instinct was to back away, to flee, but he couldn’t. Not with Madeleine behind that door, not when these people clearly had something to do with her. “What is your business with her?” Eddie pressed, his voice wavering slightly, despite his efforts to sound firm.
The figure didn’t answer. Instead, his gaze locked onto Eddie, calculating, appraising. &quot;Step aside,&quot; he said coldly, his tone carrying the weight of an order. “This is not a conversation for you to be a part of.”
Eddie stood his ground, shaking his head slightly. “I’m not moving.” The words felt like a vow more than a refusal, and even though his hands were clammy with fear, he forced himself to meet the figure’s gaze.
Will shifted behind him, his fingers twitching near his guitar, his knuckles white around the strap. Ashley, too, was tense, her hand hovering over the staff tucked behind her back, ready to pull it free. Neither of them said anything, but Eddie could feel their unspoken support—their readiness to act if it came to that.
The figures before them—silent, calculating—began to reach beneath their cloaks. Their movements were smooth, deliberate. Eddie’s eyes darted between them, his thoughts a swirl of chaos. He knew they weren’t just reaching for random items—whatever they were about to pull out, it was meant for him, for them. Will was already stepping forward, the strap of his guitar bag sliding from his shoulder, the energy in his stance ready to snap into action.
The tallest figure’s voice cut through the tension like a knife. &quot;Do not test us. Step aside, or we will make you.&quot;
Eddie’s chest tightened, but he didn’t move. He couldn’t.
&quot;You’re not taking her,&quot; he said quietly, but there was an edge to his voice now. A fire kindled in him, fed by his fear and the realization that these figures were dangerous. &quot;We’re not letting you anywhere near her.&quot;
A long pause followed, the air thick with a tension that threatened to snap. Will, his guitar now gripped in both hands, prepared for whatever came next. Ashley had her staff half-drawn, her eyes flashing with resolve. And Eddie? He simply stood there, his heart racing, his hands clenched into fists at his sides, staring down the figures as they loomed in front of him.
The tallest figure’s eyes narrowed, but he did not advance. Instead, he tilted his head slightly, as if considering Eddie’s defiance. &quot;You are making a grave mistake,&quot; he said, his voice cool but with a flicker of something more dangerous lurking beneath it. &quot;This is not a path you want to walk.&quot;
Eddie’s breath hitched, but his gaze never wavered. &quot;I’m not moving,&quot; he repeated, his voice stronger now, despite the gnawing fear in his gut.
The tension in the hallway thickened, crackling like the air before a storm. Eddie stood frozen for a heartbeat, every muscle locked in place, but then a voice, so familiar yet foreign, cut through the silence.
&quot;Step aside, Welton.&quot; The voice was calm, measured—almost too calm. &quot;This doesn't need to end this way.&quot;
Eddie’s heart skipped a beat. That voice. It sent a chill down his spine, even as his mind scrambled to place it. Slowly, he turned his head, his eyes locking onto the hooded figures.
“Walther?” Eddie’s voice was barely a whisper, his breath catching in his throat.
The figure before them, the second hooded figure, slowly lowered their hood, and Eddie’s heart sank. The straight white hair that fell around the figure’s face was unmistakable.
Walther.
It was him.
The figure's sharp, angular features became clear, his once-familiar face now cloaked in a cold, unsettling expression. He looked different—his eyes were darker, almost hollow, and his presence exuded something dangerous, something Eddie had never seen in him before.
Will’s eyes widened, disbelief spreading across his face. &quot;Walther?&quot; he said, his voice tinged with confusion and growing concern. &quot;What the hell are you doing here, man?&quot; Will shuddered, this time his voice cracking slightly. The confusion, the fear, it all hit him like a ton of bricks. The Walther he knew—the dorm mate, the seemingly harmless second-year Alchemy student—was gone. In his place stood someone Eddie didn’t recognize, someone who had crossed a line they never thought he would.
“Why are you doing this?” Eddie muttered under his breath, more to himself than anyone else.
Walther didn’t respond immediately. His expression remained stone-cold, his eyes flicking briefly to the door behind Eddie, where Madeleine’s apartment lay. Then he spoke again, his voice carrying that same cold detachment.
“You three need to step aside,” Walther said, his voice quiet but firm. &quot;You're meddling in matters far greater than just university business. If you don't move, I will be forced to make you.&quot;
The weight of his words hit Eddie like a slap, but it wasn’t just the words—it was the finality in Walther’s tone. The calmness in his voice made it clear this wasn’t a threat made in haste. This was a command.
Eddie’s heart pounded in his chest, the anger bubbling up like a storm threatening to break. He could feel Will and Ashley bracing beside him, just as ready as he was to fight if it came to that. But what Walther said next, the casual disregard for the possibility of violence, made Eddie snap.
“Stop acting like you give a shit about hurting us, Walther,” Eddie shot back, his voice fierce, biting. He took a slow step forward, his hand instinctively reaching for the wand in his jacket’s pocket. “You're a fucking traitor. And if you want to move me, make me.”
His words were fueled by a mix of fury, betrayal, and the fear that had lodged itself deep in his gut. Walther had always been a classmate, a fellow Alchemy student, someone Eddie had trusted. And now, here he was, standing before them in the dark, aligned with forces that didn’t just want Madeleine—they wanted something much more dangerous.
Will shifted beside him, his hand still hovering near his guitar case, ready for whatever came next. Ashley, too, seemed ready to spring into action, her staff now held loosely in her hand, eyes narrowed.
Walther’s eyes flickered briefly to Will, to Eddie, to Ashley. His lips parted in what might have been the faintest of smirks, but there was no warmth in it. Just cold calculation.
&quot;You really have no idea, do you, Welton?&quot; Walther said, his tone almost pitying now. &quot;This is bigger than anything you can understand.&quot;
Eddie’s eyes locked with Walther’s, his jaw set. He wasn’t going to back down. Not now. &quot;I don’t give a shit what you’re involved in,&quot; Eddie said through gritted teeth. &quot;If you want to get to Madeleine, you’ll have to go through me first.&quot;
For a moment, the two stood there, locked in a silent standoff, their stares like a battle of wills. The air hummed with a palpable tension, like the crackling before a lightning strike.
Walther’s expression softened for the briefest of moments, but there was no warmth in it. &quot;I never wanted it to come to this,&quot; he said, but his voice lacked the sincerity it once held. &quot;But if you stand in my way, I will make you.&quot; </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5E_V2</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine’s boots clicked softly on the stone path as she crossed the campus grounds, the foggy air curling around her like ghostly ribbons. Her scarf was pulled tight around her neck, and she buttoned her coat all the way up, her gloved hands tucked into her sleeves to fend off the creeping cold.
The lamplight from the faculty buildings spilled in golden puddles onto the walkway, but the rest of Edenfield was dim and quiet—students tucked away in their dorms or libraries, the hum of campus life reduced to stillness.
She reached the bus stop at the edge of the quad, where the wrought-iron sign swayed slightly in the breeze. The enchanted schedule flickered faintly, glowing with runes that shifted to show Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
With a quiet sigh, Madeleine sat down on the bench, the cold seeping through the wooden slats. She leaned back and let her head tilt toward the sky, watching her breath fog in the moonlight. 
Her gaze drifted out across the empty road, unfocused.
But her thoughts didn’t stay still for long. They circled back—inevitably—to her conversation with Professor Hudson.Military alchemist.
The words rattled in her thoughts. Professor Hudson—Gareth Hudson—had been a soldier. A Military Alchemist. A man who’d trained cadets at Crownstead Academy, where the kingdom’s most lethal alchemists were forged. How had she never known?
No wonder he locks lecture doors at the first bell. No wonder his grading feels like a tribunal.
And his daughter.
Madeleine’s breath fogged in the moonlight. If the girl had vanished before ever attending Edenfield, she must’ve been young. Twelve? Thirteen? The age when kids still pressed flowers into books and dreamed of working with gryphons.
Had Hudson searched for her? Had he turned his alchemy toward something darker in his grief?
Stop. She shook her head. She’d volunteered beside him for two years—watched him soothe a newborn hippogriff with hands steady as a surgeon’s, heard him mutter corrections to first-years with more patience than they deserved. The man she knew was strict, yes, but not…
Not what?
A gust of wind hissed through the trees. The lamplights flickered, painting the path ahead in erratic gold.
The nickname some students used for him suddenly made sense, her classmates used to call him Sergeant. She’d always assumed it was just for his drillmaster demeanor. Now, she wondered if they’d known more than she did.
Her steps slowed near the bus stop. The wrought-iron sign creaked in the wind, the enchanted schedule flashing Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
She sat heavily on the bench, the cold seeping through her coat.
How much do we really know about anyone?
Hudson with his military past and missing child. Walther with his too-precise knowledge of tiger anatomy and those surgical scars on his wrists.
Her hand drifted to her satchel, where the sketch of the chimaera lay hidden.
Two men with secrets. Two men who’d stared at that drawing like it was a ghost.
The bus loomed in the distance, its windows glowing like a beacon.
Still, something didn’t sit right.
She sat up straighter, her fingers curling against her knees. Wait.
Two things clicked. Then three. Then four.
Madeleine’s breath caught in her throat.
Research… deep anatomical knowledge… access to vulnerable populations… a strange, cold fascination with a creature that shouldn’t exist…
Her hand flew to her satchel, as if instinctively checking her sketches were still there.
Her face slowly paled, lips parting slightly as a horrible thought took shape. Not fully formed—but enough to cast a shadow over everything she’d been trying to ignore.
Could it be?
No. No, that’s insane… she told herself. But her gut didn’t agree. Her heart was thudding now, dull and fast beneath her scarf. The pieces didn’t fit perfectly—but they sat too close not to touch.
The wind picked up again, rustling the trees behind the shelter.
Madeleine stared ahead, her eyes wide, her breath held.
The bus rolled up in the distance. But she no longer felt the comfort of home awaiting her. Only a hollow, rising dread.

-o-

The bus hissed to a stop at the edge of Aetherell Reach. Madeleine didn’t wait for the doors to fully open before stepping down. She didn’t thank the driver—a small, almost sacred courtesy she never forgot. But tonight, it slipped her completely.
Her boots hit the pavement. Cold air bit at her cheeks.
She moved fast.
Madeleine spotted the phone booth at the corner just beyond the wrought-iron fence, tucked beneath a flickering lantern. She broke into a brisk jog, her satchel thudding against her side.
The glass door rattled in her grip. She shoved it open and stepped inside, heart pounding. The booth smelled of damp copper and dust, the glass fogged from the cold. Her breath ghosted across the surface as she picked up the receiver with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking.
She slipped a coin into the slot.
Dialled the number from memory.
The ring buzzed against her ear. Once. Twice.
C’mon, Eddie. Please pick up.

-o-

Eddie sat at his desk in the corner of Dormitory 7, shoulders hunched over a thick Alchemical textbook. The diagrams sprawled across the page in tight, looping script, encrypted formulas showing the delicate thresholds between copper and verdigris, gas and flame, matter and memory. Notes were scrawled in his own handwriting along the margins. The desk lamp hummed faintly, casting sharp shadows that danced with every flick of his pen.
He didn’t hear the guitar at first—barely registered the sound amid the quiet storm of his concentration. Will was on the bottom bunk, leaning against the bedframe, head bobbing slightly as he coaxed soft scales out of his guitar. Each note plucked from the strings glowed faintly in the air, trailing runes that pulsed and faded like sparks drifting on water.
The room was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the bunk frame, the gentle thrum of guitar strings, and the scratch of Eddie’s pen as he annotated a particularly difficult transfiguration formula.
He didn’t notice the sound of footsteps approaching.Didn’t register the hurried knock.Didn’t hear the door swing open.
&quot;Ashley?&quot; Will said, glancing up.
Ashley stood in the doorway, slightly breathless. Her eyes went straight to Eddie.“You’ve got a call,” she said. “It’s Madeleine. On the hall phone.”
Eddie looked up, blinking as if surfacing from underwater.“A call?” he repeated. “Now?”
Will grinned. “Oho, the mystery deepens. She finally cracked and confessed her undying—”
But Ashley didn’t laugh. She didn’t roll her eyes or shove him in the shoulder like she usually would.She just said, quietly, urgently, “Eddie. You need to come. Now.”
Eddie was already out of his chair.
Eddie jogged down the corridor, bare footsteps thudding against rough floorboards. The dorm hallway was mostly quiet—just the faint hum of lanterns and a distant laugh from someone two floors down. He rounded the corner and spotted the wall-mounted phone at the end of the corridor, its receiver swinging like a pendulum from the base.
His heart kicked up.
He grabbed it mid-swing. “Hello?”
There was a sharp breath of relief on the other end.“Eddie. It’s me.”
“Madeleine?” His back straightened. “Are you okay? You sound—”
“Listen,” she cut in, voice taut and quick, like a pulled string. “I don’t have time to explain. I need you. I need all of you—Will, Ashley, everyone—at the library. Tonight.”
Eddie blinked. “Wait, what’s happened? What’s going on?”
“It’s—” Her voice cut out for a second. A faint crackle distorted the line. “It’s Professor Hudson. I think he knows—”
Bzzzt.
A loud burst of static screamed through the receiver. Eddie yanked it away from his ear, flinching.
“Madeleine?” he called into the noise, trying the hook. “Hello? Madeleine?”
Silence. Then a low mechanical whir. Then nothing at all.
He glanced back down the hall as if expecting Ashley to still be there. “Come on…”
Suddenly—Click.
“Hello?” he tried again, breath held.
A gasp. “E-Eddie!”
He gripped the receiver tighter. “Madeleine, what’s happening?”
“I think someone’s following me.”
His stomach dropped. “Where are you?”
There was a pause. A rustle. Then, distantly: the creak of a booth door opening. Her voice dropped to a whisper.“I’m at my apartment. Just past the old fence. Near the east ward sign. There’s someone—he’s not moving, but—”
The line cracked again.
“I’ve got my wand—he’s coming closer—Eddie, I—”
Pop.
The line went dead.
Eddie stood there, frozen, the soft dial tone humming against his ear like a dirge.
Slowly, he lowered the receiver.
He turned.
Will and Ashley were already there at the end of the corridor. Ashley’s face was pale, tense—she’d heard enough to know. But it was Will’s expression that struck Eddie now: no smirk, no joke, just quiet alarm setting into his features like a stormcloud.
Eddie’s eyes met theirs. A flicker. A pause. A breathless moment where nothing needed to be said.
We’ve got to do something.
Ashley gave a sharp nod. Will was already moving.
They grabbed their jackets from the hooks near the dorm stairs, Will slinging his guitar bag over his shoulder out of instinct. No time to ask why. No time to prepare. Only the urgency in Eddie’s blood and the fading echo of Madeleine’s voice in his ear.
Then they stormed out into the night.
Through the arching gates of the dormitory. Across the frost-hushed campus. Their breath rose in quick clouds as they ran—past silent halls, over cobbled paths slick with dew, the gaslamps stretching their shadows long and fast.
Toward Aetherell Reach.
Toward her.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 16</Title>
            <Text>“Crazy?…” Catherine asked back, now looking back at Eddie, her eyes pierced him back. “Do I look crazy to you?”
“Yes!” Eddie groaned, “Yes you are! You’re talking about stepping into the darkness with whatever creatures that howled when we walk here! You said it yourself, Catherine! It’s dangerous to go beyond the Eden Flowers!”
“This time it’s different Edward.” Catherine said with determination, “I didn’t come all this way to turn back now… that Artefact is out there, Edward, the ruins aren’t far—“
“Forget the artefact!” Eddie said, “We are talking about risking your life for just… a piece of history, Catherine! Let’s just go back, and get help or something!”
Catherine then stayed silent,
“Do you even know what the Artefact is, Edward? The significance of it.”
“No, and I don’t think it worth sacrificing your life over.”
“The Artefact is Codex Xerexes.” Catherine said, “The Alchemical Codex rumored to contain the secret of transmuting the matter of a living being.”
Eddie stood there…
What?
“Isn’t that… impossible?” 
Catherine then turned her gaze towards the abyss again, “Not according to the rumor circulating about that codex…” 
“I can’t let that go to the wrong hands…” Catherine continued, “Especially now that the rumors had spread.”
&quot;You’re seriously going to risk it?&quot; 
Catherine folded the map, tucking it into her coat’s pocket. 
&quot;I am,&quot; she said simply. &quot;You can stay here if you want. I understand.&quot;
	Her words stung. He didn’t want to admit that the thought of leaving the safety of the path terrified him, but the idea of letting her wander into danger alone was somehow worse.
	Before Eddie could say anything, Markus stood up. 
His movements slow, but deliberate, as he dusted off his hands and adjusted the satchel of ingredients he’d been collecting.
&quot;I’ll go with her,&quot; Markus said, his voice calm but resolute.
Both Eddie and Catherine turned to him in surprise.
&quot;What?&quot; Eddie asked, blinking.
&quot;You clearly don’t want to go, I get it.” Markus shrugged, stepping closer. “This place gives me the creeps too. But I’m not about to let Miss Catherine go out there alone. Someone’s got to watch her back.&quot; 
&quot;You don’t even know what’s out there,&quot; 
&quot;Neither do you.” Markus responded, “But someone’s got to keep her out of trouble”
Markus extended a hand toward Eddie. &quot;Come on, Ed. Hand it over. If I’m going into uncharted ruins with her, I’m going armed.&quot;
Eddie hesitated, the weight of his flintlock rifle suddenly feeling heavier. His instincts told him to hold onto it.
“Come on, Ed.” Markus’s gaze softened, “Let me do something for you at least once. You can’t be the hero all the time, can you?”
Markus’s unwavering gaze—and the quiet determination behind his easygoing demeanor—made him think twice.
&quot;Fine,&quot; Eddie said reluctantly, finally handing the rifle over, along with the satchel of metal balls and gunpowder.  &quot;Just… don’t waste all the gunpowders trying to hit trees, alright?&quot;
“Don’t worry. I will not miss.” Markus took the rifle with a small smile, slinging the rifle over his shoulder. &quot;In fact, our next batch of potions shall have dragon scales in them.&quot;
Eddie chuckled, then watched as Markus turned to Catherine.
“Thank you Markus.” Catherine said with sincerity, “I’ll make sure to watch your back.”
“That’s my job ma’am,” Markus chuckled, “You just focus on your treasure ahead of ya!”
Catherine chuckled. The two exchanged a brief glance of understanding, and then, without another word, they stepped off the safety of the Traveler’s Path.
The golden glow of the Eden Flowers illuminated their silhouettes for a few paces before the dense forest swallowed them. 
The faint crunch of their boots against the underbrush grew quieter, until it was lost entirely to the eerie silence of the Heart of the Deep Glaive.
Eddie stood motionless, his hands now felt significantly lighter, the weight of what had just happened settling over him like a heavy cloak. Torrie, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, was still playing with her flower crown a few paces away.
For a long moment, Eddie stared after them, a deep unease gnawing at his stomach.
What if they don’t come back?</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 3E</Title>
            <Text>The inn was warm, filled with the low hum of laughter and clinking mugs, a sharp contrast to the storm raging outside. The hearth crackled, sending flickers of light dancing across the wooden beams, but for Eddie, the warmth was suffocating. He sat slumped in the chair, drenched from head to toe, water pooling beneath him. His hair clung to his forehead, and his clothes felt like lead against his bruised and battered skin. He barely noticed the curious stares of the inn's patrons, their murmurs blending into the dull roar in his mind.
Will and Ashley sat beside him, no better off. Will’s usual carefree demeanor was gone; his eyes, shadowed with exhaustion, stared blankly at the table. Ashley fidgeted with her damp sleeves, her staff resting against her chair, her lips pressed into a thin line. None of them had spoken since Catherine ushered them inside.
Catherine, perched on the chair across from them, was unbothered by the stares or the gloom radiating from the trio. She leaned back slightly, her red coat hanging off her shoulders, her apple-red hair catching the light. Despite the gravity of the situation, she still managed a faint smirk, trying to bring some levity into the room.
Her bright red coat and sharp features made her stand out even among the colorful inn patrons, but her easy demeanor somehow blended into the room’s warmth. She tapped a finger lightly on the wooden table, leaning forward with an attempt at levity.
“Well,” she began, her tone playful, “This is the most cheerful company I’ve had in decades. Honestly, Eddie, you’ve always been a barrel of laughs, but this? This is new.”
Her words fell flat. Eddie didn’t flinch, his expression unchanging. Will shifted slightly in his seat, but the faintest twitch at the corner of his mouth didn’t develop further. Even Ashley, who might have offered a polite smile, seemed too burdened by the events to respond. Catherine sighed theatrically, throwing up her hands.
“Really? Nothing? Not even a chuckle? Tough crowd,” she muttered, leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms. “Alright then, I’ll skip the pleasantries. Someone better tell me what’s got the three of you looking like ghosts.”
The silence lingered for a moment before Ashley finally spoke, her voice quiet but steady. “We were visiting a friend—Madeleine,” she explained, staring down at the table. “But... she was taken. Kidnapped.”
Catherine’s eyes sharpened, her playful demeanor fading. “By who?” she asked, her tone low and serious.
Ashley hesitated, searching for the right words. “They were in black cloaks. Hooded. There were three of them. Two of them attacked us, and... they overpowered us.” Her hands clenched into fists as she spoke, her frustration evident. “They called Madeleine by name. It wasn’t random. They were after her.”
Catherine’s brow furrowed as she leaned in closer. “Did they say anything about why? Or who they are?”
Ashley shook her head. “No, but... there’s this.” She reached into her bag, pulling out a small silver necklace and placing it on the table. The pendant was unmistakable: a grim skull resting in an outstretched hand. “One of them—the woman—had it on her. When she attacked me with her dagger, I managed to grab this before... before it all went wrong.”
Catherine turned the pendant over in her hand, her sharp gaze analyzing every detail. The faint flicker of lamplight danced across the grim sigil: a skull cradled in a skeletal hand. Her brows furrowed, and a heavy silence hung in the air as she seemed to weigh her thoughts carefully. Finally, she exhaled, setting the pendant down on the table with an audible clink.
“This,” she began, her voice low and grave, “isn’t just any insignia. This is the mark of the Black Hand.”
Ashley tilted her head, puzzled. “The Black Hand? Who are they?”
Catherine leaned back, her fingers interlocking as she regarded the three of them. “They’re an underground organization—centuries old, possibly older. Assassins, spies, mercenaries... whatever you want to call them, they’ve been pulling strings from the shadows for longer than most can remember.” Her voice softened, her tone heavy with the weight of her words. “I’ve crossed paths with them a few centuries ago. Trust me, they’re not the sort you want to make enemies of.”
Will straightened in his seat, concern flashing across his face. “How bad are we talking?”
Catherine gave him a pointed look. “The kind of bad that means they don’t leave loose ends. Their operatives are trained from a young age to be precise, efficient, and utterly ruthless. They don’t fail their missions. If you’re lucky, you never even see them coming.” She tapped the pendant with her fingertip. “This? This isn’t just a necklace. It’s proof of their presence—a rare slip-up.”
Ashley swallowed hard. “So... we’re dealing with assassins? That’s who took Madeleine?”
Catherine nodded solemnly. “If this sigil is involved, yes. And the fact that you three managed to survive an encounter with them...” She paused, her expression a mix of disbelief and admiration. “That’s no small feat. Not many in my very long existence can say they’ve faced the Black Hand and lived to tell the tale.”
Eddie, who had been silent up to this point, finally raised his head. His eyes were still bloodshot, his voice rough. “Then why didn’t they kill us? They had the chance. Walther...” His voice broke slightly, but he pushed through. “He could’ve finished me off. Why didn’t he?”
Catherine tilted her head, her sharp mind visibly turning over the question. “That, I can’t say for sure. But if I had to guess? They didn’t see you as a threat—not yet, anyway.” She shot Eddie a meaningful look. “Or maybe Walther had his reasons for sparing you.”
Will frowned, leaning forward. “But Madeleine... why her? What could they possibly want with her?”
Catherine’s lips pressed into a thin line. “The Black Hand doesn’t take people on a whim. If they’ve gone through the trouble of abducting Madeleine, then she’s part of something much larger. Something that’s likely been in motion for a long time.”
Ashley’s hands clenched into fists. “So what do we do? How do we stop them?”
Catherine’s gaze softened as she looked at the three of them. “First, we thank whatever gods and goddesses you believe that you managed to snag this.” She gestured to the pendant. “Whoever attacked you was likely a rookie. A veteran operative wouldn’t have let you anywhere near something like this. The fact that you’re alive and still have this pendant is nothing short of a miracle.”
She leaned forward, her expression darkening. “Second, we tread carefully. The Black Hand doesn’t take kindly to interference, and now that you’ve disrupted their plans, you can bet they’ll be watching.”
Eddie’s hands trembled slightly as he stared at the pendant on the table. His voice was low, but there was a hard edge to it. “I don’t care how dangerous they are. I’m going to find Madeleine, Where would they take her?”
Catherine, sitting with an uncharacteristically serious expression, looked down at the pendant in her hand. “Did they leave any clues? Anything at all?”
Eddie paused, the rain-drenched events replaying in his mind. His jaw clenched as he tried to recall every detail. “They... they said something. Walther told them to leave me behind because ‘the boy will come for her.’ And then he said...” Eddie hesitated, the memory sharp and bitter. “He said ‘Lord Raven will be pleased.’”
The air in the room seemed to shift. Catherine, who had faced magical beasts and survived countless dangers in her long life, visibly stiffened. Her usual humor and ease dissolved, replaced by an uncharacteristic tension. Her grip on the pendant tightened, and for a moment, she said nothing, her face pale.
Eddie frowned, noticing her reaction. “Catherine? What is it? Why are you acting like this?”
Even Will and Ashley, who had been quiet, looked at her with concern. Catherine, the unflappable Master Alchemist, was visibly unnerved.
Finally, she let out a slow, deliberate breath, her voice low. “Lord Raven...” she began, her words laced with dread. “He’s not just anyone. He’s the right hand of the Black Hand, their enforcer. If he’s involved, this isn’t just some rogue faction or a simple kidnapping.”
Eddie’s brow furrowed. “Why? What makes him so terrifying? You’ve faced dragons, ancient magic, everything. What’s different about him?”
Catherine hesitated, her eyes darting to the pendant again, as though it held the answers she sought. “Lord Raven isn’t just a name, Eddie. He’s a title—a mantle passed down through generations of the Black Hand. Each Lord Raven is chosen for their absolute loyalty and unparalleled skill. The current one...” She trailed off, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “He’s the one who orchestrated the Regicide.”
Ashley’s eyes widened. “The Regicide? You mean the downfall of the Edenfield Monarch?”
Catherine nodded grimly. “It was more than a downfall. The Edenfield royal family was wiped out in a single night—every heir, every cousin, every branch of the bloodline. All of it orchestrated by the Black Hand, with Lord Raven leading the charge. He didn’t just plan it; he carried out much of it himself. No one survived.”
Eddie’s heart sank, a chill running through him. “But... why would someone like that want Madeleine? What could she possibly have to do with this?”
Catherine shook her head, her expression unreadable. “That’s the question, isn’t it? If the Black Hand and Lord Raven are involved, it means Madeleine is tied to something far larger than you realize. Something they’ve been planning for a long time.”
Eddie leaned forward, his voice sharper now, tinged with desperation. “Catherine, you must have an idea. Where would they take her? You’ve dealt with them before.”
Catherine, still holding the pendant, sighed heavily. She sat back in her chair, her eyes distant, as if reaching into memories she’d rather forget. “If Lord Raven is involved, and if they’ve taken her, there’s only one place they’d go,” she said grimly. “The Underground City beneath the Citadel of Archaea.”
Eddie frowned. “The Underground City? What’s that?”
“It’s not a place most people even know exists,” Catherine explained. “The Citadel of Archaea is the heart of Solivia’s capital, the seat of its government, and the symbol of its might. But beneath it lies a buried remnant of the original citadel, the parts that were left behind when the new one was built. Over centuries, that forgotten ruin became a city of its own.”
Ashley furrowed her brow. “A city underground? Who lives there?”
“Criminals,” Catherine said bluntly. “Gangs, thieves, assassins. Every type of outlaw imaginable. It’s a haven for those who don’t want to live under Solivia’s laws. The Solivian Police and Army barely touch it—it’s too vast, too lawless, and they don’t have the resources to enforce order down there. So, they’ve left it to the criminals.”
Will, still pale and shaken, leaned forward. “And you’re saying the Black Hand... their headquarters is there?”
Catherine nodded. “If they’re carrying out an operation under Lord Raven’s direct orders, that’s where they’ll take her. The Underground City is a labyrinth, and the Black Hand’s headquarters is at its core. It’s the one place no outsider dares to go.”
Ashley’s voice broke through the tension. “Maybe we should report this to the police. If the Black Hand is as dangerous as you say, shouldn’t the authorities handle it? The army, or—”
Catherine cut her off with a sharp laugh, though there was no humor in it. “You don’t understand, my dear. The police? The army? They fear the Black Hand. Reporting this would be a waste of time. It’d sit on a dusty backlog in their office until it’s forgotten—if it isn’t already. The Underground is a no-go zone for them. No one enforces laws there. No one dares.”
Ashley frowned, disbelief plain on her face. “Then what do we do? Just let them get away with it?”
Eddie’s voice rang out with a quiet resolve. “We go there.”
The room fell silent. Will and Ashley stared at Eddie as though he’d lost his mind. Even Catherine paused, her sharp eyes narrowing as she studied him.
Will finally broke the silence. “Eddie, mate, are you serious? Do you even hear yourself? This isn’t just sneaking out to grab a midnight snack. You’re talking about walking into a city full of killers.”
Ashley crossed her arms, her voice rising. “He’s right! You don’t even know where to start. How could you possibly think this is a good idea?”
Eddie didn’t waver. “I don’t care how dangerous it is. Madeleine is down there. I’m going, whether you like it or not.”
Catherine sighed deeply, rubbing her temples as if a headache had just arrived. “Eddie, listen to me. I understand your anger, your determination. But the Underground isn’t like anything you’ve faced before. It’s chaos. A world of its own. You can’t just walk in there and demand answers.”
“Then guide us,” Eddie said, his voice firm. “You said you’ve been there before. Help us get through it.”
Catherine blinked, startled by his boldness. “That was a long time ago, I need you to understand something: I’ve been to the Underground before. Back during the reign of King Gereon the Just, I was sent there with a party of paladins when the crown still foolishly believed it could bring order to that cesspool.” Her voice turned cold, distant. “We barely made it out alive, and that was with trained warriors at my side. The king gave up on the Underground for a reason.”
“But you’ve been there,” Eddie pressed. “You know the way.”
Catherine hesitated. She looked at him, her sharp gaze softening with something close to understanding. “You’re as stubborn as your father was,” she muttered. “I suppose there’s no talking you out of this, is there?”
Eddie didn’t flinch. “No.”
Catherine exhaled, a long and weary sound. “Fine. I’ll take you. But you need to understand—there are parts of the Underground even I can’t go to. Especially now. Elves aren’t exactly welcome down there.”
“Why not?” Ashley asked.
“The people down there don’t just hate authority—they hate outsiders, especially Elves. They see us as symbols of oppression from centuries past, relics of the Solivian Empire that once enslaved their ancestors and cast them to the ground. There are places where my presence would make things worse for all of us.”
Will raised a skeptical brow. “Wait, you’re actually agreeing to this? Just like that?”
“Yes, I am.” Catherine’s gaze flicked between the three of them, her expression unreadable. Then, a sly smile crept across her face. 
“But… why?” Ashley asked,

“But if I do this, I want something in return.”
The room fell silent. Eddie frowned, suspicion flaring. “What do you mean? What do you want?”
“Oh, nothing too dramatic,” Catherine said airily, but her tone carried a strange weight, a sense of purpose that made all three of them uneasy. “Just a favor. Something I’ll collect later.”
Will narrowed his eyes. “That’s... ominous.”
Ashley leaned forward, her voice cautious. “What kind of favor?”
Catherine smiled, leaning back in her chair and twirling the pendant between her fingers. “Don’t worry your pretty little heads about it. You’ll find out when the time comes.” Her sharp teeth flashed in a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Do we have a deal?”
Eddie hesitated but then nodded firmly. “We do.”
“Good,” Catherine said, her voice light but her smile mysterious. “Then let’s prepare to descend into the shadows. You’ll need all the help you can get.” </Text>

            <Text>His breath is still rugged as he panted, he took a long deep breath.
He stood beneath the dim lights of the gas lamps, his breath still heavy from the adrenaline of the brawl.
He looked down at the wand in his hand, a mixture of disbelief and relief flooding through him. The smooth, slender stick of wood had pulled him out of yet another mess—a mess that could’ve ended with him face down in the wooden floorboards.
He chuckled to himself, the sound almost incredulous. Alchemy, he thought, had just saved his skin.
“God damn it,” he muttered under his breath, “I could never fucking escape using you, huh.” grinning to himself.
“Nice feeling, isn’t it?”
A voice called out, cutting through Eddie’s reverie. He spun around, his heart giving an unexpected lurch. Standing in the shadows, her figure framed by the lamplight,
Catherine stood in the alleyway. Her lips curled into a teasing smile as she stepped forward, illuminated by the gas lamps, her eyes gleaming with amusement.
“You know, the Alamirian Merchants are right about one thing. Eavesdropping isn’t exactly the most polite thing, Edward.” she said, her voice light and playful, her tone teasing.
Eddie blinked. Of course, he thought. She was always a step ahead.
“Come,” she said, stepping closer. “Let’s get away from this mess.”
Eddie glanced back at the ruckus now spilling out of the pub door. The sounds of shouting and scuffling still echoed through the streets.
He let out a long breath and pocketed Torrie’s school-issued wand into his pants pocket.
“Sure,” he replied with a reluctant sigh. “I could use a walk.”
With a graceful turn, Catherine began walking down the street.
Eddie followed.
 
-o-
 
As they walked, the streets seemed quieter now. Save for the distant clink of metal and breaking wood from the pub’s brawl muffled behind them.
Catherine, however, seemed to be deep in thought. After a while, she broke the quiet.
“Do you remember that day at the dining table when I first arrived?”
“Vaguely,” he replied.
“You said you were working on something.&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;You are working for your advanced magical education in the Universities,” she continued.
&quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; Eddie lied.
“And when I asked if you were considering applying for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship, you said yes.”
&quot;Yeah, I am.&quot; Eddie continued his lie.
“But you’re not, are you, Edward?” She continued, 
Eddie stopped his track, the wind continues to howl, there is no point in hiding it anymore
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eddie said, admitting the truth
“Why lie?&quot; Catherine stopped, looked back towards Eddie, her voice soft, &quot;I know you have so much ambition for Alchemy, but now you act like it’s something to run from.”
Eddie froze, his jaw tightened. He couldn’t do this—not with Catherine, not now. She was pressing on a wound he wasn’t ready to open.
But Catherine wasn’t about to let it go. She had always been the type to ask the hard questions, to dig until she found the truth, unlike him, she is an Alchemist, a real Alchemist, and like an Alchemist she will dig the truth. 
“I might not be around by the time you enrolled in Aella Academy,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but insistent. “But I was around when you’re so passionate about your first transmutation, when you’re going to ruins and dungeons retracing the steps of famous Alchemists, when you said you wanted to go to Edenfield University to become an Alchemist.”
“You used to be so passionate about Alchemy.  What happened?” Her eyes searched his face, hoping to understand the change she couldn’t quite place. 
He couldn’t tell her. He couldn’t tell anyone.
“Fifteen years, Eddie.” Catherine’s voice broke through his spiralling thoughts, “Fifteen years is nothing for someone like me. But for you... for you, I know it must have felt like a lifetime. Something happened to you during those years I was gone, something that changes you.”
He kept his gaze forward, avoiding Catherine's eyes; the words swirling in his mind but not forming on his tongue. How could he explain the loss, the guilt, the fear? How could he explain the day he had ruined his life—and someone else’s—forever?
He still couldn’t tell her. He still couldn’t tell anyone.
Finally, she sighed. “Look, I’m not going to pretend I understand what happened to you, because I certainly don’t. But I do know that you’ve changed.”

—=--
“And not in a good way.” Catherine continued, “You’re not the person I knew, you’re not the person Torrie knew. You’ve built up walls around yourself, and from what I’ve seen, it’s tearing you apart-”
“Just drop it.” Eddie interrupted, still trying to keep a polite smile.
“I beg your pardon?” Catherine responded
“Just drop it.” Eddie said with more resolution, his voice now laden with more frustation, “People has been prying on that fact, Eddie why are you not doing alchemy anymore? Eddie why aren’t you doing your transmutation anymore? Eddie where is your passion in Alchemy?”
Eddie stood there, his smile fading, he is not trying to be polite anymore, he is not lying anymore, “I’m sick of it. I’m not interested in Alchemy anymore, okay? I’m sick of people bringing it up, I’m sick of Alchemy. So please, Catherine. Just fucking drop it.”
Catherine stood there clearly taken aback, Eddie expected for her to get offended, then throwing him a three hour lecture about the importance of Alchemy, but then, she just smiled, a teasing smile as if she just found something amusing.
“I see,” Catherine finally said, sighing, crossing her arms, “Fine by me, then. I’ll drop the topic.”
A sense of ease fills Eddie, finally, some peace and quiet, no more prying, no more question-
“But I will only drop the topic only if you can drop your act.”
Eddie stood there, his heart lurching.
“What do you mean?”
“Don’t you see yourself, Edward?” Catherine said, now turning towards the pier, her arms resting on its wooden railing, “If you’re truly disinterested in Alchemy… sick of it, even.”
She then turned her head, facing Eddie, her short hair blown by the cold, sea breeze, “Then why keep working on it?”
“I see the formula you perfected up in Robert’s tower, Edward.” Catherine continued, “The homeworks you’ve helped Torrie with, and how it increased her grade significantly.”
“And don’t even get me started with your room.” Catherine continued, now turning her body, still leaning to the wooden railing, “The transmutation circles you’ve designed in your spare time, the copies of Alchemical tomes scattered on your desk, how you tried to continue your research from Aella Academy.”
Catherine opened her arms, “Why do all of that, if you’re sick of it?” 
Catherine now puts her hands back on her coat’s pocket, “I would’ve let you slide if you truly, truly hate it, Edward, sure. But the fact is that you doesn’t. You still have that passion roaring deep within you that you tried to suppress, you’re playing an act of hating Alchemy whilst the fact that you still love it. That, I can’t stand.”
“Then what do you want me to do?” Eddie asked, chuckling sarcastically, his voice low, his eyes finally meeting hers. “Do you want me just to get back to it? Pick it up again like nothing happened?”
Catherine stood there for a moment, leaning against the pier.
“I wished you were, but i know it’s not that simple, is it?” Her gaze steady, and then she gave him a small, determined smile. “So I’m offering you something different.”
Catherine stood there, the wind blows her short apple-red hair, her red coat flutters in the cold evening breeze like a flag of declaration, the silhouette of her sharp elven ear made the whole scene felt like a fairy tale. She then looked at Eddie's eyes, taking her hand out of her pocket, and raising it, and points it straight at his face.
“I’m offering you an adventure,”
“What?” Eddie blinked, chuckled slightly in confusion. “What are you even talking about?&quot;
&quot;I'm offering you an Adventure for you to be a part of.&quot; Catherine said, her voice steady and firm. “There’s an Artefact hidden deep within the illusory forest of The Deep Glaive. I could use a fellow Alchemist like you.&quot; She smiled, &quot;It'll be like the old days, isn't it?”
“A fellow, is a hard stretch don’t you think, Catherine?” Eddie chuckled, his face sombre, “It can't be like the old days, you know? I’m not that kid anymore, Catherine,” he said quietly. “I can’t be that kid.”
“Of course you're not, you'll never be. You don’t have to be that kid.” Catherine’s light blue eyes stared at his with piercing gaze.
“You just need to be you.”
Eddie looked into her eyes, seeing the earnestness in her gaze. An invitation, a chance to leave behind his regrets and step back into something larger than himself.
He didn’t have an answer right away. But in the silence that followed, he knew that Catherine wasn’t going to let him walk away from this, not that easily. Not when she knew something about him.
“I don’t know,” Eddie said.
“It’s okay,” Catherine said, now continuing her pace, Eddie followed, the cadence of their footsteps echoes through the hard cobblestone road, “But you don’t have to lie anymore, it’s futile. You can lie all you want to Torrie, to Markus, Alyssa, Robert. But one thing for certain.”
“You can’t lie to a fellow Alchemist.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 6E</Title>
            <Text>The morning sunlight streamed lazily through the common room's wide windows, illuminating the clutter of blankets, pillows, and sprawled bodies that adorned the sofas. Eddie lay tangled in the patchwork quilt Henry had tossed him the night before, the sound of faint humming and the sizzle of cooking pulling him from a restless sleep. He groaned, rubbing his eyes, his vision still bleary.
The smell of something sweet and savory wafted into the room, prompting Eddie to sit up. Through the haze of sleep, he spotted sharp, pointed ears and a crown of short red hair bobbing in the kitchen. Catherine, ever the enigma, was at work, humming a lilting tune that seemed centuries old. Will and Ashley, cocooned in their blankets, remained fast asleep on the other sofas.
Curiosity piqued, Eddie stood and shuffled toward the kitchen, his bare feet padding against the cool floor. As he neared, the sight of Catherine bustling around the stove came into full focus. She wore her usual smirk, her hands deftly flipping thin pancakes on a cast iron skillet.
“Good morning, sleepyhead,” Catherine greeted without turning, her tone as light as her humming.
“Morning,” Eddie mumbled, his voice still thick with sleep. He leaned against the counter, watching as Catherine plated a stack of golden-brown pancakes. The sweet, earthy aroma grew stronger, and Eddie’s stomach gave an involuntary growl. “What’s this?”
“Tagenon,” Catherine said with a note of pride, drizzling honey over the stack. “Traditional elven breakfast. Wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk. Served with figs, dates, or olives—whatever’s fresh.”
Eddie raised an eyebrow, eyeing the pancakes skeptically. “That sounds… ancient. You sure that’s going to fly with the other guys?”
Catherine chuckled, pouring a fresh dollop of batter into the skillet. “It’s been feeding Elvenkind for millennia. If it’s good enough for us, it’s good enough for you lot. Besides,” she added with a teasing glance, “you’re lucky I’m cooking at all. Do you know how much effort this takes?”
Eddie shook his head, grinning despite himself. “I guess we’ll find out if it’s worth it.”
Catherine slid a plate of Tagenon toward him, accompanied by a small bowl of dates and a few figs. “Try it, then.”
Eddie hesitated, then picked up a fork and cut into the pancake. He took a cautious bite, his taste buds immediately met with a surprising mix of sweetness from the honey, tang from the curdled milk, and the subtle richness of olive oil. He blinked, taking another bite.
“Not bad,” he admitted, nodding. “Actually… pretty good.”
“Ha! Told you,” Catherine said, turning back to the stove with a triumphant smile. She gestured to a bottle of red wine on the counter, its label faded and its glass dusty with age. “Pair it with this. Vintage Solivian wine.”
Eddie frowned, glancing at the bottle. “Wine? For breakfast?”
Catherine shrugged, her smirk widening. “You’re students. Isn’t drinking at odd hours part of the experience? and this one is a vintage from... let’s see... ah, ninty years ago,” Catherine said with a sly smile. “I thought it might pair nicely, i might have forgotten where i got this from.”
“Ninty years,” Eddie repeated, shaking his head. “That’s older than my grandfather.”
“Your grandfather was eighty years old, Edward, but alas,” Catherine winked. “Good wine only gets better with age. Like me.”
Eddie rolled his eyes but couldn’t help chuckling. “You’re impossible.”
“And you’re welcome,” Catherine shot back. “Now go wake the others. Breakfast doesn’t keep, and I’m not reheating it.”
The common room buzzed to life as Eddie nudged Will and Ashley awake. Blankets rustled, groggy complaints filled the air, and the aroma of Catherine’s cooking wafted through the space, coaxing everyone into consciousness.
“What... smells so good?” Will muttered, rubbing his eyes as he sat up.
“Breakfast,” Eddie said simply, gesturing toward the kitchen where Catherine was now arranging the spread. The dining table had been transformed into a miniature feast, with plates of golden Tagenon, bowls of figs, dates, and olives, and a decanter of the vintage red wine sitting at the center. Everything was placed with precision, as though Catherine were hosting an important gathering rather than feeding a group of university students.
Jake and Jane were the first to stumble into the kitchen, their curiosity piqued. Both History of Magic majors, they were instantly captivated by the sight of Catherine orchestrating the meal. Their questions came like a flood.
“Wait, hold on,” Jake began, gesturing toward the food. “Is this... traditional elven cuisine? Like, pre-Solivian Empire?”
Jane nodded eagerly. “And those plates—are they arranged in accordance with old elven customs? You know, the ones described in Legends of the Lost Courts? This symmetry—was it for practical use or ceremonial significance?”
Catherine laughed softly, clearly amused. “Oh, it’s nothing that grand. This is just how meals were prepared in my household when I was younger. It’s more habit than tradition.”
“But you lived during those times, didn’t you?” Jane pressed. “You must have seen the courts! The monarchs! The fall of the Solivian Empire!”
“As a child, yes,” Catherine said, sipping from her glass of wine. “The courts were splendid but full of bickering. And as for the fall of the empire, it was chaotic, but life moves on. People adapt.”
Jake and Jane exchanged wide-eyed glances, completely enraptured.
“I can’t believe it,” Jake whispered. “We’re having breakfast with someone who’s seen everything.”
Eddie chuckled, shaking his head. “Don’t inflate her ego too much, Jake. She already acts like she owns the place.”
Meanwhile, Ashley had taken a seat and was carefully cutting into her Tagenon, her face lighting up at the first bite. “This is amazing,” she said, spearing a date and popping it into her mouth. “It reminds me of something my mom used to make. Witches cook like this all the time—using foraged ingredients, wild honey, dried fruits.”
Catherine smiled warmly. “I imagine your mother has excellent taste.”
Henry, who had taken his plate and leaned against the kitchen counter, chimed in. “The dates bring me back to Alamiria. It’s a staple where I’m from—always served during festivals or with strong coffee in the mornings.”
“Alamiria?” Catherine asked, raising an eyebrow. “I spent some time there centuries ago, traveling with a nomadic tribe. They had the most beautiful rituals under the stars. That’s probably where I picked up my fondness for wandering.”
Henry’s eyes widened slightly. “You lived with the tribes?”
“For a while,” Catherine said, pouring herself a small glass of wine. “They were kind enough to share their customs with me. I’ve always admired their resilience—and their cooking.”
As the group sat down, they noticed how the food had been arranged with an almost ceremonial touch. Each dish was placed symmetrically, with smaller plates framing the larger platters. The utensils were positioned as if awaiting a formal banquet.
“Is this... how you normally eat?” Ashley asked, gesturing toward the spread.
Catherine laughed lightly. “Oh, not always. But when you host a meal, you do it properly. In my youth, meals were gatherings of community. This? This is a modest rendition.”
Jake leaned over to Jane and whispered, “This is definitely going in our term paper.”
“So, Miss Catherine,” Henry began, his tone steady but curious, “If what Eddie said was correct, you are basically guiding us into the lion’s den. What’s your plan?”
Catherine, mid-bite of her Tagenon, raised a hand for him to wait as she chewed. She finally swallowed and replied casually, “I know someone who might help us get a foothold near the Citadel of Archaea. Her name’s Tiara. She’s—or, was—a Company Captain of the Royal Paladins in that area.”
“Was?” Eddie interjected, narrowing his eyes.
Catherine shrugged. “Technically, yes. I haven’t checked in a while.”
“How long is ‘a while’?” Eddie asked, raising an eyebrow. “You’ve got a... unique sense of time. Don’t forget, Catherine, not everyone is ageless like you.”
Catherine chuckled, brushing off the jab. “It’s been about thirty years since I last saw her. But Tiara’s condition should mean she hasn’t changed much.”
Eddie tilted his head. “Condition?”
“She’s a werewolf,” Catherine said nonchalantly, taking another sip of her wine. “A good one, though. You’ll like her.”
The room fell silent for a beat.
“Wait, hold up,” Jake blurted. “Did you just say werewolf? Like... claws and fangs? Full moon transformations? That kind of werewolf?”
Catherine arched an elegant brow. “Precisely. Is that so hard to believe?”
Jane nudged Jake with her elbow, her voice a mix of astonishment and excitement. “First elves, now werewolves. Holy shit, Jake. This is the best day of my life.”
Jake leaned back in his chair, his hands spread wide in mock exasperation. “Holy shit, Welton! What’s next? You gonna introduce us to dragons?”
Eddie chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “If I could, I would, Jake. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”
Jane leaned forward, her curiosity piqued. “Wait, so werewolves are real too? This is insane. Do they look like the old Alamirian carvings—half-man, half-wolf—or is it more subtle? Oh, do they howl when the moon’s out?”
“Only if they’re being dramatic,” Catherine said dryly. “And no, not all of them look like monsters. Tiara, for example, looks like an average person most of the time. Well, except for her temper. You’ll see.”
Jake was practically vibrating with excitement. “This is insane. An elf, a werewolf... I’m not going to survive this year, Jane. It’s too much.”
Henry shook his head with a faint smile. “Focus, Jake. Catherine, are you sure you can trust this Captain Tiara after all this time? A lot can change in thirty years.”
Catherine gave him a sly grin. “Oh, I’m certain. Tiara and I... let’s just say we’ve been through a lot together. She owes me a favor or two. Besides, her position—or lack thereof—doesn’t matter. What matters is that she knows the Underground better than anyone.”
Henry sighed, seeming to accept this answer for now. “Alright. If you’re confident, we’ll go with it. But for the record, I hope Tiara doesn’t throw us out—or worse.”
Eddie shot Henry a grateful look. “Thanks for not bailing on us.”
Henry smirked. “Someone’s gotta keep you three from getting yourselves killed.” </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 20 RAW</Title>
            <Text>“Alright, Markus, breathe.” Eddie straightened, his pulse quickening.  “What happened to Catherine?” 
Markus shook his head rapidly, his breath still ragged. “I—I don’t know! It all happened so fast—”
“Slow down, Mark,” Eddie pressed, stepping closer. “What did you see? What attacked Catherine?”
Markus’s grip tightened around the rifle as he cast a wary glance over his shoulder, as if expecting something to lunge from the shadows. His voice came in a whisper, hoarse with disbelief.
“It was… like a dragon.” He swallowed. “But its eyes—”
He squeezed his own shut, as if trying to unsee the memory. When they opened again, they were filled with something raw, something barely held together.
“It had six pairs of them. Red. Watching. Burning.”
Eddie’s stomach turned to ice.
His mind stuttered, refusing to process what he’d just heard. His breath felt short, his heartbeat a slow, echoing drum in his ears.
Six pairs of eyes.
His hands clenched into fists, nails digging into his palms. But the answer had already lodged itself in his gut, a cold, immovable weight.
Markus’s rifle trembled in his hands, the barrel still pointed toward the trees—toward the unseen thing lurking just beyond their fragile circle of light.
Eddie forced himself to speak, his voice hollow.
“It’s the fucking sentinel.” He swallowed, the name like lead on his tongue.
“The Nightingale Dragon.”
Silence settled over them, thick and suffocating.
Eddie’s gaze flickered to Markus, who was still gripping the rifle like a lifeline, his breath uneven. He turned to Torrie, whose fists were clenched at her sides, her jaw tight with unspoken fear. The three of them stood in the golden glow of the Eden Flowers, their faces pale, eyes searching one another—seeking answers neither of them had.
&quot;What are we going do?&quot; Markus’s voice was barely more than a whisper.
“W-we should help her…” Torrie responded.
“Are you insane?!” he hissed. “We don’t even know if she’s still—”
“Still what?” Torrie shot back. “She’s out there, and we’re just standing here? We should get help from town!”
“There is not time, Torrie!” Markus said, “Don’t you know how long is it to go out of this forest alone? Even Gunther’s farm is miles away!”
Eddie's hands were ice-cold. His breath came too fast, too shallow. Every instinct screamed at him to run—to turn away, to pretend he hadn’t heard Markus’s terrified description of the creature lurking beyond the trees. His stomach churned at the thought of it.
Catherine was out there. Alone. Against that… Against the Sentinel, Nightingale Dragon.
His fingers twitched uselessly at his sides.
His body wanted to flee. His mind wanted to shut down.
But then he thought of Catherine. The way he used to speak about her, eyes shining with wonder. The way he used to believe she was invincible. The way he had once dreamed of being like her.
And now, now, when she needed him—
He took a sharp breath.
He couldn’t let this be another regret. Eddie exhaled, slow and steady. His hands stopped shaking.
He turned to Markus, his voice firm, unwavering.
“Mark,” he said, holding out his hand. “Give me the rifle.”
“Wh-what?” Markus stammered, his knuckles white where they gripped the weapon.
Eddie met his gaze, steady and sure, “You stay here with Torrie.”
“I’m going after her.”
Torrie’s eyes blazed with concern and anger as she jumped up, 
&quot;Eddie, this is insane!” her voice rising in desperation.  “You can't just go off into the forest after what Markus described. It's too dangerous!&quot;
Eddie didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he reached into his satchel and pulled out a small, worn paper bag of gunpowder. His movements were deliberate, almost mechanical. He tore the bag open, dry powder spilling between his fingers like dust as he spat out the remaining paper.
&quot;I don’t have time to argue, Torrie,&quot; he said, his voice sharp but steady. &quot;Catherine’s in danger.&quot;
Torrie let out a frustrated breath. &quot;And so will you!&quot;
Eddie ignored her. Raising the rifle’s hammer, he poured the fine black powder into the pan. The grains settled in the shallow basin, an eerie moment of stillness before the storm. With a soft snap, he closed the frizzen, sealing the charge.
&quot;You don’t even know what you’re walking into!&quot; Torrie pressed. &quot;You heard Markus. It’s a dragon! Do you think you can just go in there and—&quot;
With swift, practiced motions, Eddie poured the rest of the gunpowder into the barrel. He placed a round inside, feeling the shift in weight, the gravity of what he was about to do. The heavy ball rested against the powder. He tapped it down with the ramrod, his hands steady despite the storm raging inside him.
The final motion—the priming, the preparation—snapped something into place within him. He stood tall, rifle in hand, decision made.
“Eddie, Listen—“ Torrie, realizing he wasn’t stopping, made a last-ditch effort. She took something underneath her shirt, a chain.
Eddie’s gaze flickered towards her, the sight is familliar.
It’s a ring.
It’s his ring… his old heirloom. 
A jade stone, deep green, set within a silver band. He had always known it was important, even if he never fully understood why. A relic of a family he had never known.
&quot;Here,&quot; Torrie insisted. Her voice wavered, but her grip was firm. &quot;Take it back. It’s yours, Edward, please.”
Eddie stared at it, his throat tight. &quot;I don’t need it,&quot; he muttered, &quot;I can handle this on my own.&quot;
&quot;Just take it, Edward.&quot; Her voice was softer now, but the weight of her words pressed into him. &quot;They’re yours. They are meant to be yours!&quot;
Eddie hesitated, then pocketed the ring. His fingers brushed against the cold, familiar metal.
&quot;Fine,&quot; he said.
And without another word, he turned toward the forest.
Eddie turned and moved past the protective ring of the Eden Flowers. Stepping into the darkened forest. As he ventured further into the unknown, the shadows seemed to close around him. The protective flower's glow dimmed behind him, leaving the path uncertain. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 17E</Title>
            <Text>Eddie, Will, and Ashley pressed forward, their determination unwavering even as they faced the full force of Walt's dark magic. But with each passing moment, their efforts seemed to falter, their spells growing weaker and less effective against their formidable opponent.
As the battle raged on, Walt's dark energy crackled around him, his eyes alight with malicious intent. He watched with a cruel smirk as Ashley sneered and laughed, plunging her staff toward him with all her might. But to her shock and horror, nothing happened.
Ashley's laughter turned to disbelief as she tried again, channeling her magic through her staff with all her strength. But still, nothing. It was as if her magical abilities had been completely drained, leaving her powerless against the dark magician before her.
Beside her, Will strummed his guitar with frantic desperation, hoping to summon the power of his music to aid in their fight. But like Ashley, his efforts proved futile, the strings producing no sound, no magic.
Eddie's heart sank as he watched his friends struggle against Walt's dark magic. He knew they were in trouble, knew that they were no match for their formidable opponent without their magical abilities.
And then, with a flick of his wrist, Walt unleashed his signature spell, a shockwave of dark energy that sent Eddie, Will, and Ashley hurtling backward toward the walls of the fortress. They crashed against the stone with a resounding thud, their bodies bruised and battered, their spirits broken.
As they struggled to their feet, their minds reeling from the shock of their defeat, they looked out at the captives who watched them with wide eyes. They had failed. Failed to protect their friends, failed to defeat the dark magician who threatened everything they held dear.
But even in their moment of defeat, Eddie, Will, and Ashley refused to give up hope. They may have lost this battle, but they knew that the fight was far from over. With a renewed sense of determination burning in their hearts, they vowed to regroup, to gather their strength, and to rise once more against the forces of darkness that threatened to consume them.
Eddie, Will, and Ashley lay on the cold, stone floor, their bodies aching and their spirits nearly broken. The captives watched in silent horror, their hopes dwindling as Walt's dark presence loomed over them. Eddie's mind raced as he dug through his satchel, desperately searching for something, anything that could turn the tide.
His fingers brushed against a familiar piece of parchment, and he pulled it out, recognizing it immediately. It was a light rune, a relic from their studies, often underestimated but incredibly potent in the right hands. With a deep breath, Eddie focused all his remaining energy and activated the rune.
A blinding flash of light erupted from the parchment, filling the room with a searing brilliance. Walt cried out in surprise, his dark magic faltering as he shielded his eyes from the sudden glare. Seizing the moment, Eddie reached deeper into his satchel, retrieving another rune—one of their final projects: the summoning rune.
With a swift motion, Eddie activated the summoning rune. A burst of radiant energy materialized into a pixie, its wings shimmering with a bright, ethereal light. The pixie hovered in the air, exuding an aura of pure magic that began to rejuvenate the exhausted trio.
Will felt a surge of power flow through him, the pixie's magic resonating with his own. He grabbed his guitar and strummed a powerful chord, channeling the energy into Ashley. The melody reverberated through the room, intertwining with the pixie's magic and igniting Ashley's latent power.
Ashley, her strength renewed, stood up and faced Walt, who was still reeling from the blinding light. With determination in her eyes, she raised her battle staff, the pixie's magic coursing through her veins. The staff glowed with an intense light as she advanced on Walt, each step radiating confidence and resolve.
Walt, regaining his senses, tried to muster another spell, but Ashley was faster. She channeled the combined magic of the pixie and Will's music, and with a final, decisive strike, she brought her staff down upon Walt. The impact was explosive, a brilliant burst of light and energy that engulfed the dark magician.
Walt let out a final, anguished cry as the light consumed him, his dark magic dissipating into nothingness. The room fell silent, the oppressive atmosphere lifted as the remnants of Walt's power faded away.
Eddie, Will, and Ashley stood victorious, their bodies battered but their spirits triumphant. The captives erupted into cheers, their fear replaced with relief and gratitude. Eddie turned to his friends, a weary but proud smile on his face.
&quot;We did it,&quot; he said, his voice filled with both exhaustion and elation.
Ashley nodded, her grip on the staff tightening as she looked around at their rescued friends. &quot;We couldn't have done it without each other.&quot;
Will, his guitar still humming with residual energy, grinned. &quot;And a little help from our pixie friend.&quot;
As the pixie fluttered around them, casting a warm, gentle light, the trio knew that their bond had been strengthened through the trial. They had faced the darkness together and emerged victorious, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
The dissipating smoke revealed a scene of weary triumph, the air thick with the aftereffects of the battle. Eddie, Will, and Ashley sat slumped against the wall, their bodies screaming in protest but a sense of victory flickering in their eyes. As the cheers of the rescued captives echoed through the room, the heavy footsteps of Henry, Christine, and Geralt entering the chamber felt like a jarring intrusion.
Will, ever the optimist, tried to lighten the mood. &quot;Took you guys long enough,&quot; he rasped, a weak smile playing on his lips. But his attempt at humor fell flat. The trio who had just entered looked like they had seen a ghost.
Henry, usually brimming with witty remarks, stood speechless, his eyes scanning the room with a frantic urgency. Christine's face, usually composed and resolute, was now etched with a chilling dread, her lips pressed into a thin, white line. Even Geralt, the stoic witcher, seemed shaken, his gaze fixed on a crumpled form lying motionless against the far wall.
The joyous atmosphere evaporated, replaced by a suffocating silence. A cold dread seeped into Eddie's bones as he followed Geralt's gaze. His heart plummeted as he realized who lay lifeless on the cold stone floor – Walt. But it wasn't the sight of their defeated enemy that sent shivers down his spine. It was the realization that dawned on him with horrifying clarity.
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Eddie managed to force the question past his parched throat, already dreading the answer.
Christine turned to him, her voice barely a whisper. &quot;It's Lord Raven,&quot; she choked out, her eyes filled with a terror that mirrored Eddie's own growing fear. &quot;He's here.&quot;

The stillness of the Archaea Undercity was broken by the clatter of iron-shod hooves on cobblestone as a horse-drawn carriage, drawn by two massive black stallions, approached the fortress entrance. The carriage itself was an imposing sight, its dark, polished wood adorned with intricate carvings and sinister symbols that seemed to writhe in the dim light.
The carriage came to a halt, and two hooded cultists, their faces hidden in shadow, knelt before the wagon door. The air grew colder, a palpable sense of dread settling over the area as the door slowly creaked open.
From within the carriage, a hulking figure emerged, standing an awe-inspiring four meters tall. His presence was a dark silhouette against the gas-lit fog. He wore a raven mask, its elongated beak and dark feathers giving him an avian yet menacing appearance. His cloak, made of black feathers, rustled softly with each movement, and his iron boots clanked ominously against the stone floor.
The hooded cultists remained kneeling, their heads bowed in reverence and fear. One of them spoke, his voice trembling slightly. &quot;My lord, the proceedings are ready to begin.&quot;
Lord Raven stood still for a moment, surveying the scene with an air of detached authority. When he spoke, his voice was muffled by the mask but carried an undeniable power that sent shivers through all who heard it. &quot;Good,&quot; he said, his tone commanding. &quot;Then let us proceed.&quot;
The cultist hesitated before continuing, clearly uneasy about delivering bad news. &quot;But I'm afraid, my lord, there are some disturbances with the sacrifices. There are disturbances in the cellar.&quot;
Lord Raven's head turned slowly towards the fortress, the beak of his mask pointing directly at the imposing structure. The movement was deliberate and unnervingly slow, adding to the aura of dread that surrounded him. &quot;Oh?&quot; he mused, his voice a chilling mix of curiosity and menace. &quot;Then let's clear up the disturbances. I don't want to miss the blood moon for the ritual.&quot;
&quot;Very well, my lord,&quot; the cultist replied, his voice barely above a whisper.
With a sense of impending doom hanging in the air, Lord Raven began to walk forward. Each step of his iron-clad boots against the stone floor echoed through the alleyways, a foreboding rhythm that matched the pounding hearts of those within the fortress.

            <Text>

Eddie barely slowed as he shoved his bedroom door open, the hinges groaning in protest. His pulse pounded in his ears as he bolted down the narrow passageway, the floorboards creaking beneath his hurried steps. 
His arms clutched a haphazard stack of papers and notebooks, some pages slipping loose in his rush.
He was late.
The scent of dried lavender and rosemary clung to the air, undercut by the sharp, metallic tang wafting from the tower above—his father was already deep in his alchemical work.
Markus had warned him, and yet he had still lost track of time.
Eddie skidded to a stop at the base of the spiral staircase, his breath quick and uneven. His gaze flicked to the rune glowing faintly near the stairwell, a familiar aqua shimmer against the stone floor. Alfred’s spellwork. It would cut the thousand-step climb into mere moments.
For a brief second, he hesitated. The rune was convenient. Useful. But magic never quite worked right in his hands, and he didn’t have time for a mishap now.
No choice. He gritted his teeth and lunged up the first step, taking the stairs two at a time.
His boots struck the wood with heavy thuds, the polished steps groaning under his frantic ascent. The wind howled through the narrow side windows, whipping against his cheeks as he climbed higher, the stone walls tightening around him like a winding tunnel. 
His lungs burned, his legs ached, but he didn’t slow.
The tower stretched above him, seemingly endless, but Eddie pushed on, gripping the rail with one hand while keeping his papers pressed against his side with the other.
He was late. He had to move faster.
-o-
Eddie finally reached the top of the tower, his lungs burning and breath hitching in quick, ragged bursts as he crossed the threshold into the alchemist’s lab on top of the tower.
Soft light from the open window cast amusing shadows on the craggy stone walls. He was surrounded by the odours of crushed plants and boiling concoctions and the saline air from big windows with delicate wooden beams. This vantage position revealed the Hamlet of Weshaven, a seaside hamlet full with merchants and fishermen ready for their voyages. 
“Hey there, Eddie!” Mr. Welton said, looking up from his meticulous work with a casual air. 
Mr. Welton looked up from his desk, relaxed. Ageing grey hair neatly brushed back, giving him a quirky genius look. On his nasal bridge, round glasses framed his bright blue eyes that gleamed with warmth and mischief. He looked like someone who had spent his life studying and working, wearing a basic collared shirt with rolled sleeves. Despite his age, his slender frame was nimble. 
Mr. Welton looked up from his desk the moment Eddie burst into the tower, his lips twitching into a smirk.
&quot;Well, well,&quot; he drawled, leaning back in his chair, &quot;Where in the world could my son’s brilliant backache potion formula be? Surely it hasn’t been lost to time and space?&quot;
Eddie let out a breath, half-exasperated, half-relieved, as he rushed to the desk and dropped his bundle of notes and notebooks with a satisfying thud.
&quot;Right here,&quot; Eddie said, smoothing out the topmost page. &quot;And I didn’t lose it—I just… took Torrie to her first day at Aella Academy.&quot;
Mr. Welton, who had been preparing for another playful jab, paused. His teasing smirk softened into something warmer.
&quot;Ah,&quot; he said, nodding as he adjusted his glasses. &quot;Now that is a worthy excuse.&quot;
Eddie ignored the jab, quickly straightening his notes before launching into an explanation. &quot;So, I was thinking—the base potion we use for muscle relief has a long absorption time, right? What if we swap out the oak bark infusion for something more reactive, like willow extract? It has natural pain-relieving properties, and it should cut the absorption time in half.&quot;
Mr. Welton hummed as he followed along, his fingers tapping against the parchment while he skimmed Eddie’s work. His expression, usually lighthearted, turned serious with concentration. He nodded occasionally, making quiet sounds of approval.
After a long moment, he let out a low whistle. &quot;This is brilliant,&quot; he said, setting the page down. &quot;I might actually use this.&quot;
Eddie sat back, his chest swelling with pride. He had expected constructive criticism, maybe even a few amused remarks about overcomplicating things, but praise? That was rare.
Finally, Eddie asked, &quot;So, what’s on the agenda today?&quot;
“Alright, we will need to get these raw materials processed,” Mr. Welton said, slipping on a pair of protective goggles as he approached the array of ingredients strewn across the workbench. “We’ve got to get them ready for brewing in the apothecary. Your mom's a bit understaffed today, and I could really use another set of hands around here.”
Eddie nodded, shaking off his lengthy sleep's fog. He joined his dad and used a wicked-looking knife to slice through the twisted roots. The boiling concoctions, clinking glass devices, and scent of plants and chemicals comforted him as he worked. 
Lab was busy. On another table, glass jars bubbled and steamed, their twisting tubes blazing like ancient monster veins in the faint light. Some bubbled with vibrant hues, while others lay in little glass vials with ethereal light. Eddie saw jars of dried dragon's blood, sparkling scales from mythological fish, and powdered gems on the walls and recalled his childhood ambitions of becoming a famous alchemist, which he had long abandoned.  
 
-o-
As Eddie and Mr. Welton toiled together, the harmonious symphony of slicing and grinding resonated through the lab, mingling with the bubbling and hissing of potions brewing in their cauldrons. The air was thick with the rich scents of crushed herbs, mineral powders, and simmering extracts.
“You know,” Mr. Welton began, his tone casual as he measured out a vibrant powder, “your mother found something this morning.”
Eddie paused mid-chop, glancing up from the herbs he was dicing. “Found something?” He furrowed his brow. “What is it?”
His father didn’t answer right away. Instead, he reached for a folded parchment on the workbench and smoothed it out with deliberate care. The thick, cream-colored paper bore an emblem Eddie didn’t recognize at first—but then, his stomach lurched.
Mr. Welton turned the letter toward him, tapping a finger against the wax seal. “This,” he said, “is no ordinary letter, son. Especially not one that just happens to turn up in a mountain of parchments.”
Eddie swallowed, his throat suddenly dry. The words on the front of the letter gleamed in elegant, embossed script.
Sage’s Institute – Referral for Scholarship Consideration.
Mr. Welton tapped the letter again, his voice steady but firm. “This isn’t just any invitation, Eddie. Look here.”
Eddie leaned in, his eyes following his father’s finger as it traced a line of text near the bottom of the parchment.
Referral valid until the 29th of December, 1927.
His stomach twisted. “That’s barely a month from now,” he murmured.
“Exactly.” Mr. Welton folded his arms, watching Eddie’s reaction carefully. “If you don’t make a decision before then, the opportunity vanishes. You won’t get another chance.”
Eddie exhaled slowly, setting his knife down on the wooden cutting board. “I just… I haven’t really thought about it,” he admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’m not sure I’m cut out for something like that. It’s been tough to think about anything beyond today.”
His father nodded, but there was something searching in his gaze, as if he saw past Eddie’s words. “I know it’s a lot,” he said, his tone gentler. “But this isn’t just about potential—it’s about timing. If you let this slip by, you might regret it down the line.”
“I get it, Dad. But I—”
Mr. Welton set down the vial he had been handling and leaned slightly against the workbench. “Do you remember Aunt Catherine, Edward?”
 “Aunt Catherine?” Eddie blinked, caught off guard. “I… kind of? I mean, I haven’t seen her in decades.”
His father chuckled, shaking his head. “Figures. You were young. But you certainly remember that old alchemy book you’ve practically memorized, don’t you?”
“That was from her?”
“She gave it to you when you were just starting to experiment with transmutations.” Mr. Welton continued, “You spent hours poring over that thing, scrawling notes, testing theories. And back then, you wrote to her constantly, asking questions, exchanging discoveries. She was the one who pushed you to enter that competition.”
Eddie stared down at the referral letter, his mind flickering back to the late nights he’d spent scribbling formulas, the excitement of testing a new method—how much of it had been shaped by that book?
“She practically helped you won those referral, Eddie,” his father continued. “Without her, you might not have even known half the techniques that set you apart. Imagine how she felt if you didn’t consider this.”
Eddie swallowed, suddenly feeling the weight of it all. Catherine had believed in him long before he’d even considered believing in himself.
“It’s been ages since Catherine crossed my mind. So, how’s she holding up?” Eddie asked.
“Your aunt is a real piece of work for sure!” Mr. Welton grinned, a spark of nostalgia dancing in his eyes, “She’s a pretty impressive Alchemist all on her own.”
“Yeah, I remember her being amazing at that,” Eddie said, his mind wandering as he chopped the herbs with a casual flick of his wrist. “But I totally blanked on how much time has passed since we last met.”
Mr. Welton let out a soft chuckle, shaking his head. “That’s because time doesn’t pass for her the way it does for us.” 
“Catherine isn’t just anyone, Eddie.” He picked up the referral letter, his gaze lingering on it. “She’s an Elf. The last remaining ones, that is. For all we know, she’s lived through the rise and fall of kingdoms, seen the Solivian Empire in its prime. She’s a living piece of history.”
Eddie paused mid-slice, glancing up. “Huh.” He hadn’t really thought about it that way. Catherine had always just been… Catherine—brilliant, eccentric, and endlessly knowledgeable. But now that he thought about it, there was something timeless about her, the way she spoke, the way she carried herself, as if she had seen far more than she ever let on.
Mr. Welton smirked. “And yet, despite all that, she still took the time to mentor some scrawny kid with a head full of ambition. Catherine was my Master before she set off on her own epic adventure. She taught me much of what I know today.”
“Hold on, you were her apprentice?” Eddie enquired, arching an eyebrow in curiosity. “You?” The legendary Mr. Welton?”
“Absolutely!” Mr. Welton laughed  “Before I became the legendary Mr. Welton,” his father continued, waving his hand as if brushing away a pesky fly. “I was just a kid, and Catherine was already stirring up quite the storm in the alchemical world. It’s incredible to consider just how gifted she truly is.”
Eddie felt a twist in his gut, a sharp reminder of how much he craved those wild connections and epic adventures. “I totally need to get in touch with her, write a letter or something.”
“Absolutely,” his dad cheered on. “Catherine would totally be stoked to hear from you. She’s always seen the greatness in you, even when you couldn’t see it yourself.”

Eddie took a step back from the solid workbench, swiping the back of his hand across his forehead to clear the sweat. With a flourish, he stuffed the final ingredients into robust wooden crates, ready for their journey down to the bustling apothecary below. He paused for a second, taking in the impressive organisation he had pulled off, a wave of pride swelling within him
“Okay, Dad, I’m heading down,” he shouted, striding towards the door that opened to the twisting staircase. The doorframe creaked like it was just as eager to escape as he was.
But just as he was about to swing the door open, Mr. Welton’s voice stopped him in his tracks. “Eddie, hold up for a second. could you hang around for just a little while longer? I've got one more favour to ask of you.&quot;
Eddie spun around, his curiosity ignited like a spark in a dark room. “Another favor?” What is it?”
Mr. Welton propped himself against the workbench, the morning light streaming in and painting warm shadows across his face.
“So, there’s this thing that popped up in my head, and I could really use your help with it.”
“What sort of thing are we talking about here?” Eddie asked, a twist of anxiety churning in his gut.
“It’s nothing too complicated, I swear,” his dad said, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth, but it didn’t do much to ease Eddie’s nerves. “Just a little tidbit I think you’ll find interesting.”
Mr. Welton’s smile dimmed just a touch as he bent down beneath the workbench, retrieving a small, intricately designed cage. Within the confines of the cage itself, a lovely songbird flitted about, its radiant feathers shimmering in the soft glow of the light. 
“Let this songbird go free,” Mr. Welton said, his voice a mix of kindness and authority. “It’s time for it to spread its wings and soar.”
Eddie paused, a surge of protectiveness washing over him for the tiny creature.
“But… it’s a songbird.” It could totally go missing or end up in a bit of trouble.”
“Songbirds are meant to sing and soar, not be caged,” his father said, the warmth in his voice clashing with the unease bubbling up inside Eddie. “Seriously, just let it slide.”
With a heavy sigh, Eddie stepped forward, gently accepting the cage from his father's grasp. As he opened the cage’s door, the songbird paused for a heartbeat, then erupted into the air, its wings a flurry of motion as it ascended into the vastness of the sky, a vibrant splash of colour against the endless blue. Eddie observed its departure, a bittersweet sensation unfurling within his heart.
“And just like that, she is free,” Mr. Welton declared, a spark of triumph dancing in his gaze.
Eddie spun around to face his dad, the heavy cloak of uncertainty still draped over his shoulders.
“Alright, but what’s the deal with that?”
Mr. Welton's face transformed into a mask of mischievous gravity.
“Alright, I've got another task for you.”
Mr. Welton then went on digging under the workbench again, he found a bigger, more elaborate cage. The morning light illuminated a gorgeous Fire Falcon in its cage, its plumage shimmering like liquid gold. The bird's ferocious glance fell on Eddie, and he suddenly saw its magnificent majesty. 
“Let this one go, too,” Mr. Welton said, his voice playful.
Eddie's eyes went as wide as saucers. “You want me to release the Fire Falcon?” But it’s worth a fortune! You can’t just let it go!&quot;
Mr. Welton leaned in closer, a glint of mischief dancing in his eyes. “How about I wager you a hundred gold coins?”
“A hundred gold coins?” Eddie found himself caught in a whirlwind of temptation, the thrill of the wager tugging at him while his instincts screamed to safeguard the awe-inspiring beast before him. “But it’s a Fire Falcon!”
“Exactly,” Mr. Welton said, a grin spreading across his face like he’d just uncovered a hidden treasure. “This isn’t merely about the wager; it’s about daring to leap into the unknown.” Consider it a crash course in bravery.”
Eddie paused, a storm of thoughts battling it out in his mind. “But what if it just doesn’t return?”
“Well, I guess that’s how the universe works,” Mr. Welton said, his eyes unwavering. “Sometimes, you’ve got to release your grip to discover what treasures await you.”
Eddie let out a reluctant sigh, his head bobbing in agreement as he fought to push down the knot of apprehension twisting in his stomach. “Alright, I’ll do it.”
As he drew near the cage, Eddie inhaled deeply, his heart pounds. He opened the cage’s door and with a gentle push, urged the Fire Falcon onwards, anticipating its swift ascent into the sky. 
Yet, to his astonishment, the falcon stayed resolutely perched within the confines of the cage, its golden eyes locked onto him, as though contemplating the choices before it.
“Come on!” Eddie urged, his heart racing like a runaway chariot on a quest. “You’re meant to soar off into the sky!”
But the Fire Falcon just cocked its head to the side, refusing to budge. Eddie felt a heavy weight settle in his stomach as the truth dawned on him. “No way… this is not happening.”
Mr. Welton let out a hearty laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. “Well, well, well, it seems I’ve come out on top, son.”
Eddie was hit by a wave of disappointment, swirling with anger and confusion like a storm brewing in his chest. “Why not?” Why didn’t it just take off into the sky?
Mr. Welton's expression turned warm as he moved in closer. “Sometimes, Eddie, just like that falcon, we get a little too cosy in our cages. We hesitate to take that leap, even when the chance to escape is staring us in the face.”
Eddie lingered, the disappointment brushing against him like a cool breeze, as he reached for the meticulously arranged ingredients resting on the workbench. The vivid hues of the herbs and raw materials drew his gaze, yet his thoughts wandered, circling back to that moment when the Fire Falcon had stubbornly remained in its cage.
“Thanks for the lesson, Dad,” he said, managing a tight smile as he turned to face his father. 
He sensed the words dripped with sweetness, yet beneath the surface, frustration bubbled like a volcano ready to erupt. He wasn’t looking for some fancy metaphor about comfort zones and soaring through the skies—he just needed to find his own way forward.
As he approached the door, Eddie wore a mask of calm, resolute in his mission to keep the irritation simmering just below the surface a secret. “I’ll just take these to the Apothecary,” he said, trying to keep his voice cheerful, even though a storm of irritation brewed inside him. “Appreciate the, um, ‘lesson’.”
Mr. Welton observed his son's silhouette,worry reflected in his eyes. He could perceive the strain in Eddie’s shoulders, the manner in which his jaw clenched tightly. “Eddie,” he called after him, but the young man had already vanished through the door, descending the twisting staircase that spiralled down from the tower.
The lab door creaked shut behind Eddie as Mr. Welton leaned against the workbench, arms folded, watching his boy descend the stairs. His quiet sigh blended with the rich, aromatic alchemical concoctions around him. 
“Ah, Edward,” he murmured to himself, shaking his head slightly. “If only you could see what I see.”
Mr. Welton felt a deep ache in his chest, aware that Eddie was ensnared in a tangle of fear and reluctance. His heart ached for his son, longing to share the wisdom he had known through the years. He grasped, with a profound clarity, the anxieties that tethered souls to the ground, preventing them from taking flight.
“At times, one must allow them to navigate their own path,” he murmured, observing the final sight of Eddie as he faded from sight. 
“Do not remain in that cage, son,” he breathed softly, his voice a mere flutter in the air. “A vast realm lies ahead, eager for you to take flight.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5 V2</Title>
            <Text>The warm scent of crushed herbs and dried roots filled the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton stood over the stovetop in her small corner kitchen, carefully stirring a simmering pot of golden liquid. The steam curled upward, laced with chamomile, turmeric, and a whisper of dried lavender. Her mortar and pestle sat nearby, still dusted with powdered ginger and licorice root.
It was a quiet morning, just the way she liked it. Sunlight filtered through the gauzy curtains above the sink, painting soft rectangles on the tiled floor.
She ladled the finished batch into small brown glass bottles, wiping each one clean before lining them up neatly on the wooden shelf beside the spice rack. The labels were handwritten—“Cough &amp; Cold Blend,” “Nerve Soother,” “Sleep Tonic”—and she hummed softly as she arranged them. A part of her took pride in this quiet routine. Always had.
Most of her real work was in prescriptions, of course—modern potions and compounds dispensed from Welton’s Apothecary. But in the quiet hours, she still practiced the old ways, brewing traditional remedies for the neighbors who asked for them. Remedies that weren’t always scientific, but comforting.
Once everything was cooled and sealed, she wiped her hands on her apron and stepped out into the dining area. The paper was folded on the table, waiting for her. She sank into the chair with a small sigh and reached for her tea, still steaming.
The news today was as dull as ever. Council debates. Rising fish prices. An article on some promising student from Canterbury who got into Cambridge.
The bell over the shop door chimed.
Mrs. Welton looked up, setting the paper aside. “Come in, love,” she called warmly. “I just brewed a fresh batch if you’re here for the usual.”
A regular—a young mother from down the road—stepped in with a sheepish smile. “You’re a lifesaver, Mrs. Welton. Jamie’s caught that awful cough again.”
Mrs. Welton stood, already reaching for a bottle. “Say no more, dear. Let’s get him sorted.”
And just like that, the rhythm of her day continued—quiet, steady, filled with warmth and herbs and small kindnesses.
The bell over the shop door chimed again.
Mrs. Welton glanced up from her paper, expecting another neighbor in search of remedies. It had been that kind of day—quiet, steady, interrupted only by the occasional customer with a sniffle or sleeplessness.
The bell rang again not long after, and again she rose, her movements practiced and unhurried. Another remedy here, a friendly chat there. Nothing out of the ordinary.
And then, at last, the bell rang a fourth time.
She looked up—this time, pausing.
It was Eddie.
He stepped inside with an odd look about him. Tense shoulders. Fidgeting fingers. His satchel hung awkwardly from one arm. Something was off.
Mrs. Welton stood. “Eddie? What’s wrong, love? And why didn’t you come through the back door?”
“I... I need to talk to you about something.”
There was a pause. She noted the way he wasn’t meeting her eyes.
“All right,” she said gently, stepping closer. “What happened?”
Eddie glanced around the shop, then lowered his voice. “Do you remember Edenfield University?”
Mrs. Welton blinked. Her brow creased. “Of course I do.”
“I signed up for their scholarship intake,” he said, half-defensive, half-uncertain. “Since you were an alum, I was hoping you could tell me something—anything—about it. There’s no record online. Nothing in the public library. It’s like it doesn’t exist.”
For a second, Mrs. Welton didn’t respond.
Then her eyes widened—just slightly. Her expression changed, not to surprise exactly, but recognition. And something else beneath it. A quiet seriousness Eddie had never seen in her before.
She walked briskly toward the shopfront.
Eddie watched as she flipped the wooden sign hanging in the front window from Open to Closed.
She turned the bolt on the door, then looked back at him.
“All right,” she said. “Sit down. We’re going to talk.”

-o-
The clink of ceramic cups was the only sound in the room for a while.
They sat at the small dining table tucked behind the storefront, the lights dimmed low as the late morning sun filtered through the drawn curtains. Mrs. Welton poured two cups—Eddie’s usual lavender blend, pale and fragrant; her own chamomile, warm and golden.
Eddie sat quietly, hands wrapped around his mug, watching the steam curl toward the ceiling. He could hear the faint ticking of the old clock on the wall.

Eddie sat quietly, hands wrapped around his mug, watching the steam curl toward the ceiling. He could hear the faint ticking of the old clock on the wall.
Mrs. Welton took a long breath, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup. “So... you wanted to know about Edenfield?”
Eddie nodded.
She glanced at him, one brow arched. “How come you know about it? You were so sure it was a hoax this morning. What changed your mind?”
Eddie hesitated. “I saw their website at the library earlier... and it looked real.”
Mrs. Welton blinked. “Website?” Her voice was quiet but sharp with curiosity.
“It looked old, like something from the early 2000s,” Eddie said. “But it had everything—pictures, details, even recent posts.”
Her brow furrowed slightly, the lines on her forehead deepening.
“They had accreditation,” Eddie added. “Real ones. I checked. From international agencies—even some obscure ones that cross-reference with university lists.” His voice gained pace, half trying to convince himself. “But the majors… they’re nothing I’ve ever seen before. No engineering, no medicine. Just—Conjuration, Illusions, Bardry, Alchemy, Automatons…”
He trailed off. Even saying them aloud felt strange.
Mrs. Welton was quiet. She took it all in, her fingers now wrapped firmly around her teacup. Her expression was unreadable—no longer casual, but something more distant.
“They’ve set me up for a test and interview in London,” Eddie said. “The test is next month.”
Her eyes sharpened. “And what did you pick?”
Eddie blinked. “Sorry?”
“Your major,” she said, voice a little lower now. “What did you apply for?”
“I’ve always wanted to study chemistry,” Eddie said. “So I picked the one that sounded similar.”
Mrs. Welton didn’t move. She just watched him, waiting.
“I picked Alchemy.”
For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The clock ticked. Somewhere behind the wall, a kettle hissed faintly from cooling.
A stillness settled. Then, barely above a whisper, she murmured:
“By the gods…” Her hand trembled slightly as she placed her teacup back onto the saucer. “So what she predicted is true…”
Eddie’s brow furrowed. The sound of her voice—soft, reverent, almost frightened—set off a quiet alarm in him. He watched his mother with growing unease.
“Mum?”
She didn’t respond. Her eyes were still lost in some invisible distance, lips parted as if she were speaking to someone only she could hear.
“Mum, you're scaring me.”
Her gaze slowly returned to him—wide, sharp now, filled with something he couldn’t name.
“Say… Edward,” she said, her voice low and calm, too calm. “How old are you?”
“What?” Eddie gave a short, uneasy laugh. “Mum, don’t be silly—we just celebrated it together, remember? At Maxim’s. I’m eighteen this month.”
But Mrs. Welton didn’t laugh. Her eyes didn’t soften.
“Edward…” she said, and now her voice changed—no longer puzzled or vague, but resolute, serious. “I’ve got a long story to tell you.”
She stood, moving toward the curtain that separated the storefront from the back. She paused before pulling it closed, glancing once more toward the windows as though checking for eyes. Then she drew it shut with a whisper-soft rustle.
The room dimmed. The ticking clock seemed louder now.
Mrs. Welton turned to him fully, no longer just his mother in a kitchen, but someone else entirely. Someone older than he had ever realized.
“Something you were never meant to know—until now.”

            <Title>Chapter 4E_V4</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine sprinted down the stone corridors of the Alchemy Faculty building, her boots skidding against the flagstones as she careened around a corner. Her satchel slammed against her hip with every frantic step, but she didn’t dare slow to adjust it—not when the minute hand on her watch had already crept two minutes past the hour.
Damn it, damn it, damn it—
Professor Hudson’s class had started sixty seconds ago. And everyone knew what that meant: the door would be locked. No exceptions. No mercy. Not even for Sanctuary caretakers with perfect attendance.
She hadn’t meant to lose track of time. But between her backlog of Herbology assignments and the notes she’d been scrawling—notes about the tiger, about Eddie, about that thing that moved like a man but wasn’t—the hour had bled away like ink in rain. Now her lungs burned, and the puzzle pieces she’d been trying to force together only grew sharper, more jagged in her mind.
She turned sharply down a narrow hallway, nearly colliding with a floating cart of flasks.
Focus.One thing at a time.
The heavy oaken door to the Herbology lab loomed ahead, carved with ivy and curling vines that shimmered faintly in the light. As she reached for the handle, her heart pounded—half from the run, half from the fear that she was already too late.
But the soft murmur of voices inside met her ears, and when she eased the door open, she exhaled with relief.
Professor Hudson wasn’t here yet.
Inside, students clustered in groups, tending to glass terrariums, adjusting runic lighting, or arguing softly over pruning techniques. The scent of damp moss and pollen clung to the air like mist.
Madeleine slipped inside quietly, closing the heavy door behind her with a soft click. She scanned the room quickly, eyes darting over the clusters of students and their green, glowing plants, until they settled on a familiar figure near the back. Walther sat hunched over his workstation, his fingers moving steadily across a piece of parchment covered in neat, looping script.
Without hesitation, Madeleine crossed the room and slid into the chair beside him. The moment her weight settled, the door creaked again—Professor’s arrival—and the low hum of anticipation rippled through the lab.
Walther looked up briefly, his dark eyes narrowing as he took in the flushed, breathless expression on her face. “Madeleine, you’re late,” he said, voice quiet but edged with mild amusement. “You’re usually the first one here. What kept you? Another all-nighter at the Sanctuary?”
She swallowed, forcing a tired smile. “Something like that.”She didn’t want to say more, especially not here—not with half the class listening and Walther’s perceptive gaze pressing gently but firmly.Instead, she nodded toward his parchment. “What are you working on?”
“The assignment, of course.” Walther rotated the specimen, revealing veins of bioluminescent blue threading through the cactus spines. “Alamirian sun-cactus and Edenfield’s midnight mushroom. Grafted at cellular level.”
She recoiled. “That should be impossible. Their cellular structures are polar opposites—one thrives on light, the other decays in it.”
“It might be if you are talking in Herbology tersm,” Walther’s lips twitched. &quot;And yet.&quot; He tapped the dish; the hybrid tissue shuddered. &quot;In, Alchemy. the creation of the mythical philosopher is to merge two essential substance of an opposite spectrum into one great creation called the Magnum Opus. If you understand its most essence, all things can merge. Even opposites.&quot; His eyes flicked to hers, sharp as a scalpel. &quot;Imagine what else could be made if only people study cross-disciplines.&quot;
“Well,” Madeleine smiled, “I’m sure it will make something great-”

The door groaned open.
Conversations died mid-syllable. The scrape of chairs, the rustle of parchment—everything stilled as Professor Gareth Hudson stepped into the lecture hall.
He moved like a blade being sheathed: smooth, silent, and sharp enough to draw blood. His polished boots clicked against the stone floor, each step measured, deliberate. The air thickened with the scent of bergamot and iron—his signature blend of alchemical reagents and something darker.
No one breathed too loud.
Hudson didn’t glance at the class. He simply took his seat, slid a leather-bound tome from his desk, and flipped it open. The crack of the spine echoed like a gunshot in the silence.
A full minute passed. The only sound was the turn of a page.
Then—
“What,” he said, without looking up, “Is the subject of today’s lecture?”
The silence grew teeth.
Students stiffened in their seats. A first-year near the front gripped their quill so tight it snapped. Hudson didn’t react. He just waited, his finger resting on a line of text as if to say: I have all day. You don’t.
Then—
“The application of alchemical grafting in medicinal botany.”
Madeleine’s voice cut through the quiet, clear and unflinching.
Hudson’s finger paused. Slowly, he lifted his gaze to hers. The lantern light caught the silver in his hair, the frost in his eyes.
“Can anybody elaborate?”
Madeleine opened her mouth—
“Not you, Mrs. Daedallia.” His voice was a scalpel. “Give chance to the others.”
Silence.
Then—
Then - the scrape of Walther's chair. His voice, calm: &quot;Cross-species grafting via alchemical mediation. Reducing both specimens to their essential salts before recombination allows hybridization beyond natural taxonomical boundaries.&quot; His fingers absently traced the petri dish's edge. &quot;Even between monocots and dicots.&quot;
Hudson's pen stopped mid-margin note. The nib split the paper.
Hudson’s expression didn’t change. “Excellent... Excellent, Mr. Schroder.” He closed the book with a thud that made half the class flinch. “Though you omitted the critical flaw.”
Walther’s pen hovered above his notes. “The… the mortality rate, sir?”
“The arrogance.” Hudson’s fingers steepled, his voice a whip. “What you just described is alchemy—not herbology. You are herbologists, not alchemists. Use your own bloody terms.” His gaze swept the room. “Anyone else?”
Hudson’s gaze locked onto Madeleine like a falcon sighting prey. “
Since you’re so confident in your herbology knowledge, Mrs. Daedallia—” He gestured to the chalkboard with a flick of his fingers. “Enlighten us. In correct terms.”
A beat of silence. The class held its breath.
Madeleine exhaled through her nose, then stood. Her chair didn’t scrape. Her steps didn’t falter. She reached the board and plucked a piece of chalk from the tray, her fingers steady.
Madeleine nodded absently, still feeling the weight of sleepless nights and the gnawing mystery at the back of her mind. She reached down to her satchel to pull out her binders, intending to get her notes ready.
But as she yanked the bag up hastily, her tired fingers slipped. Instead of the binder’s sturdy spine, her grip caught the loose papers tucked behind it. In an instant, a flurry of parchment spiraled out, fluttering down like autumn leaves across the stone floor.
“Oh, no,” Madeleine muttered under her breath, cheeks flushing as she crouched to gather the scattered sheets.
Walther, sitting beside her, was already reaching down to help, his calm presence a quiet anchor amid her embarrassment. 
“Here,” he said softly, handing her a few papers with an easy efficiency.
“Thanks,” she murmured, biting her lip as she carefully stacked them back into the binder.
“Be careful next time alright? This is not a good time to-“
As Madeleine crouched, carefully gathering the scattered papers with Walther’s steady help. Each sheet slipped back into her binder brought a small wave of relief. Almost all of it was accounted for—except one.
Her eyes followed Walther’s gaze as he held a single page between his fingers. His expression shifted sharply, a flicker of something like horror mixed with disbelief crossing his usually unreadable face.
“Walther?” Madeleine’s voice was low but urgent. 
He didn’t say a word, his fingers tightening around the paper as if it burned him. Her heart quickened, unease prickling beneath her skin.
A shadow fell over them.
“Is there a problem, Mrs. Daedallia?”
Professor Hudson loomed above, his polished boots inches from the scattered papers. His gaze flicked to the sketch still trapped between Walther’s fingers.
A beat. Two.
Then—
“I see you’ve taken up art.” Hudson’s voice was dry as bone. “Though your proportions are off. Alamirian tigers have five lumbar vertebrae, not six.”
With a quick tug, she yanked the page from his grasp, pulling it closer to her. Her breath caught as she recognized the sketch sprawled across the parchment.
It was the drawing she’d made—the detailed, haunting sketch Eddie had described to her of the tiger-human chimaera.
Madeleine’s pulse hammered in her ears as Walther’s wide eyes met hers, his usual calm shattered for a fleeting moment. She quickly hid the paper beneath her binder, forcing her voice steady.
“Where did you...?”
Walther’s lips pressed into a thin line, eyes darkening. For the first time, the mysterious distance around him felt like something more—something dangerous.
Madeleine swallowed, her secret suddenly feeling heavier than ever. 

-o-
The moon hung low over Edenfield’s towering spires, its silver glow pooling on the cobbled pathways. Lanterns flickered in the cold breeze as Madeleine stepped out of the Alchemy building, tugging her scarf tighter and buttoning her coat all the way up to her chin. The night bit at her cheeks, and the long day pressed against her shoulders like a weight.
The classroom emptied like a sinking ship—students fleeing into the night, their chatter swallowed by the groan of the oak doors. Madeleine lingered just long enough to seem unhurried, adjusting her scarf with deliberate slowness. The wool scratched her jaw, but the cold bit deeper.
&quot;Mrs. Daedallia.&quot;
Hudson’s voice slithered through the drafty hall. He stood framed by the window, moonlight carving his silhouette into something sharp and surgical.
&quot;You care for a chat?&quot;
It wasn’t a question.
Madeleine’s fingers tightened around her satchel strap. &quot;Of course, Professor.&quot;
Hudson leaned against the stone windowsill, the moonlight cutting across his face. For a moment, he looked almost human—tired, maybe. Then the mask slid back into place.
&quot;That sketch of yours,&quot; he said, tapping his gloved fingers against the sill. &quot;Where’d you get the idea? Not many have seen a South Alamirian Tiger up close.&quot;
A beat. Madeleine’s pulse thudded in her throat.
&quot;Just something I cobbled together,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably inaccurate.&quot;
Hudson chuckled—a rare, dry sound. &quot;I’ve handled more of those beasts than the Sanctuary’s records show. Their stripe patterns are like fingerprints. Yours was… close.&quot;
Too close.
Madeleine’s fingers twitched toward her satchel, where the sketch was hidden. &quot;Lucky guess.&quot;
&quot;Of course.&quot; His smile didn’t reach his eyes. He knew she was lying.
Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken things. Then—
&quot;You remind me of her,&quot; Hudson said abruptly.
Madeleine blinked. &quot;Who?&quot;
&quot;My daughter.&quot; His voice was quieter now, the edge dulled. &quot;Livia. She was like you—curious. Smart. Argued with professors twice her age just to see if she could win.&quot; A pause. &quot;It got her into trouble sometimes.&quot;
There was something in his tone—a warning, or a regret. Madeleine couldn’t tell.
&quot;She sounds like someone I’d like to meet,&quot; she offered. &quot;Maybe she could volunteer at the Sanctuary with—&quot;
&quot;She’s gone.&quot; Hudson cut her off, his voice flat. &quot;Vanished before she ever set foot in Edenfield.&quot;
The words hung in the air like frost.
Madeleine’s breath caught. &quot;I… I’m sorry.&quot;
Hudson straightened, his gloves creaking as he flexed his hands. &quot;Don’t be. Curiosity isn’t a crime.&quot; He met her gaze, and for the first time, his icy demeanor cracked just enough to show the grief beneath. &quot;But it has consequences.&quot;
The words hung between them, sharp as a scalpel left on a lab table. The wind outside rattled the windowpanes, but neither moved.
Then—
&quot;Tell me, you’ve known me two years now,&quot; Hudson said, his voice quieter than she’d ever heard it. &quot;In class. At the Sanctuary. Tell me honestly…
“do you think I’m a bad father?&quot;
Madeleine’s breath caught.
This wasn’t Professor Hudson the alchemist, the disciplinarian, the man who locked lecture doors at the first chime of the clock. This was just Gareth Hudson, a man with a missing daughter and a grief he couldn’t dissolve in acid or bury in research.
She could lie. She should lie.
But Madeleine had never been good at that.
&quot;I don’t know,&quot; she said slowly, meeting his gaze. &quot;But if you raised your daughter like you teach your classes…&quot; She hesitated, then forged ahead. &quot;She might’ve thought you didn’t care. Even if you did.&quot;
Silence.
Hudson’s face didn’t change, but his gloved hand flexed at his side, like he was gripping an invisible vial too tight.
Madeleine immediately regretted it. &quot;I’m sorry. That was—&quot;
Hudson chuckled.
A real, genuine laugh—low and rough, like gravel underfoot. Madeleine had never heard it before. Her face flushed hot.
&quot;Do you hate my teaching so much,&quot; he said, shaking his head, &quot;that you assumed I raised my children the same way?&quot;
Madeleine stiffened, her ears burning. &quot;I— That’s not what I—&quot;
&quot;Oh, I think it was.&quot; His smirk was faint but unmistakable. &quot;Go on, then. Since we’re being honest.&quot; He crossed his arms. &quot;What’s so extreme about my methods?&quot;
Madeleine exhaled sharply. &quot;You lock students out for being a minute late. You grade like a war tribunal. Half your class has stress-induced nosebleeds before midterms.&quot; She paused, then added, &quot;Sir.&quot;
Hudson’s smirk deepened. &quot;And yet, you’re still here.&quot;
&quot;Because I- not everyone can do what I do,&quot; she admitted grudgingly. &quot;It’s brutal!&quot;
For a moment, he just studied her, the ghost of amusement still lingering. Then his gaze drifted past her, toward the darkened hallway, as if seeing something—or someone—else.
&quot;In my previous career,&quot; he said, voice softer now, &quot;that was how we taught. No second chances. No room for error.&quot; A pause. &quot;And we produced the finest alchemists in the kingdom.&quot;
There was something in his tone—pride, yes, but also a quiet ache.
Madeleine tilted her head. &quot;Previous career?&quot;
Hudson’s expression shuttered. &quot;Go home, Mrs. Daedallia.&quot; He turned back toward the window, the moonlight washing him pale again. &quot;And for God’s sake, stop drawing creatures you don’t understand.&quot;
The dismissal was clear. But this time, as Madeleine turned to leave, she caught the way his fingers brushed against the locket at his throat—just once, like a reflex.
Madeleine hesitated at the corridor’s edge, her scarf fluttering in the icy draft. “You’re not going home? Curfew’s in ten minutes.”
Hudson didn’t turn around. “Campus business.” His gloves flexed around a brass key—too large for a desk drawer, too small for a door.
She should’ve left. But curiosity hooked into her ribs.
“Professor,” she called after him, “what did you do before Edenfield?”
Silence. Then—
“Crownstead Military Academy.” His voice was flat, stripped of its earlier humor. “Instructor, Seventh Spearhead Division. I was a Military Alchemist.”
Military alchemist. The words landed like a lit fuse.
Images snapped into place: his precision, his contempt for hesitation, the way he’d described grafting as “arrogance”—not on ethical grounds, but tactical ones.
Then he was gone, his footsteps echoing down the hall—too rhythmic to be anything but marching.

PROFESSOR HUDSON IS A RED HERRING, THE CULPRIT IS WALTHER

Professor Hudson talked to Madeleine after class in which he asked about her sketch,Madeleine in return asked Professor Hudson’s method of teaching, saying that it’s kind of extreme, but Professor Hudson said that in his previous career, it was how he teach, and he made the best batch of students that way.

At the last moment, it is revealed that Professor Hudson was teaching at Crownstead Military Academy. He was a soldier.

Note that Professor Hudson was a military veteran, probably to the rank of general

            <Title>Chapter 8E V2</Title>
            <Text>As the first fingers of dawn crept through the city's dense fog, a sliver of light sliced through the grimy window of Mr. Jester's apartment. Inside, the space served a dual purpose: a sanctuary for sleep and a war room for relentless pursuit of truth. Countless hours of investigation and writing had been waged within these walls, leaving their mark on the overflowing bookshelves and stacks of papers.
Mr. Jester, an indie crime journalist renowned for his relentless pursuit of truth, was already at his desk. The rhythmic clack of the typewriter keys mingled with the faint hum of the city awakening outside. His brow furrowed in concentration, eyes scanning a page from a handwritten notebook before translating his thoughts onto the crisp white sheet of paper. A steaming mug of black coffee, its aroma a potent lure, sat within arm's reach – a faithful companion for these early morning hours. His glasses perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, and a pen rested behind his ear, poised for swift notes or corrections.
In these quiet, pre-dawn hours, the world around Mr. Jester faded away. He was completely absorbed in his writing routine, fingers flying over the typewriter keys with practiced ease. The rhythmic tapping became a soothing soundtrack to his thoughts, each keystroke bringing him closer to unraveling another piece of the truth.
&quot;Just a few more lines, and I'll have this done…&quot; he muttered to himself, lost in the flow of his words.
His reverie was shattered by a jarring ring at the door. Mr. Jester sighed, the sound heavy with exasperation. &quot;Who could it be this early?&quot; he grumbled, pushing himself away from the desk and shuffling towards the front door.
Unbolting the locks, he cracked the door open to find three figures standing on the other side. Will, instantly recognizable, stood front and center, flanked by Jake and Jane, the twins, their mischievous grins unmistakable.
&quot;Hey, we're Eddie's friends,&quot; Will announced, his voice booming through the narrow entryway. &quot;He said to meet someone called Oswald Jester in this room.&quot;
Mr. Jester, momentarily taken aback, raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes, that's me,&quot; he finally acknowledged, his voice laced with a hint of amusement. &quot;Though, calling my apartment this grand of a 'room' might be a bit of a stretch.&quot;
A burst of laughter erupted from behind Will. Jake and Jane, never one to miss an opportunity for a playful jab, chimed in. &quot;Edward's Army reporting for duty! Sir!&quot;
Will joined in the laughter, the tension easing from his shoulders. Mr. Jester, despite himself, couldn't help but crack a slight smile. &quot;Very funny,&quot; he conceded, stepping aside to allow them entrance. &quot;Wait in the middle room. I'm still finishing up an article.&quot;
Will, Jake, and Jane exchanged amused glances before filing into the designated room, their earlier apprehension replaced by a sense of camaraderie. Mr. Jester, left alone with the rhythmic clicking of his typewriter once more, attempted to refocus on his article. But the echoes of their laughter lingered, a reminder of the task at hand and the unexpected army that now stood beside him.
A few minutes passed, the rhythmic clack of the typewriter a lonely sound in the now-quiet apartment. Just as Mr. Jester felt a sliver of focus returning, another jarring ring shattered the fragile peace.
&quot;This better be important,&quot; he muttered under his breath, his earlier frustration bubbling back up.
He trudged to the door again, flinging it open with a sigh. This time, three familiar faces greeted him – Henry, Claire, and Madeleine, a small army of their own in tow.
&quot;Hey, we're Eddie's friends,&quot; Henry announced, his voice carrying a hint of sheepishness. &quot;Can we come in?&quot;
Madeleine, ever the diplomat, stepped forward, a warm smile on her face. &quot;We also bring some snacks for you and the others,&quot; she added. &quot;My parents baked some cookies yesterday! They were practically begging me to bring some.&quot;
Mr. Jester pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to tamp down the surge of exasperation. &quot;Oh, feel free,&quot; he sighed, stepping aside to allow them entrance. &quot;Join the others in the middle room. And please,&quot; he added, a hint of pleading in his voice, &quot;keep it down alright?&quot;
&quot;Okay!&quot; Madeleine chimed, relief washing over her features. With a nod, Henry, Claire, and Madeleine filed inside, their group merging with Will's. The low murmur of conversation that had subsided earlier rose in volume once more, punctuated by the crinkling of cellophane and the tempting aroma of freshly baked cookies.
Mr. Jester sank back into his chair, the typewriter keys mocking him with their silence. Refocusing on his article felt like an impossible feat. The chaotic energy of the growing army seeped into his workspace, a stark contrast to the solitude he usually craved.
The rhythmic clack of the typewriter resumed, a valiant attempt to reclaim the battlefield of Mr. Jester's focus. Each keystroke was a soldier pushing back against the tide of interruptions. But just as a semblance of order began to re-establish itself, the doorbell, that insistent harbinger of chaos, rang once more.
Mr. Jester's face contorted in a grimace. His brow furrowed so deeply it threatened to become a permanent resident of his forehead. With a sigh that spoke volumes of his frustration, he pushed himself away from the desk and marched towards the door, each step heavy with resignation.
He yanked the door open, his patience hanging by a thread. Before him stood Christine and Geralt, an unlikely pair united by their shared purpose. Christine, ever the picture of propriety, wrinkled her nose at the faint scent of stale tobacco and hops that wafted out from the apartment.
&quot;Is this the right place?&quot; she scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. &quot;It smells like…&quot; she paused, searching for a particularly scathing word, &quot;…like a bachelor pad that hasn't seen cleaning supplies in a decade.&quot;
Mr. Jester, on the verge of exploding, simply reached his limit. He threw his hands up in exasperation. &quot;Yes, it's the right place!&quot; he barked. &quot;Middle room, with the rest. Now if you'll excuse me…&quot;
Christine, momentarily taken aback by his outburst, simply grunted in response and swept past him, Geralt trailing behind with a stoic expression. The door slammed shut behind them, adding another layer to the symphony of noise emanating from the middle room. Mr. Jester, defeated, returned to his desk. The frustration was etched on his face, a stark contrast to the blank page staring back at him.
Mr. Jester slammed his fist onto the desk, the impact rattling the typewriter and sending a jolt through his already frayed nerves. &quot;Just a few more minutes of peace,&quot; he growled, his voice hoarse with frustration. &quot;That's all I ask, dear gods of the arcane, just a few more minutes to finish this damn article!&quot;
As if in mockery, the doorbell pierced the tense silence with a shrill ring. Mr. Jester lurched to his feet, his chair tumbling backward with a crash. Coffee cup in hand, he stormed towards the door, the scalding liquid threatening to spill over.
He flung the door open, the snarl on his face rivaling a cornered badger's. But before he could unleash a torrent of frustration, the words died in his throat. There, on his doorstep, stood Eddie, a look of sheepish apology plastered on his face. But Eddie wasn't alone. Flanking him was a sea of faces, a throng of students, parents, and concerned citizens – all united by the cruel hand of the Black Hand. A flicker of recognition sparked in Mr. Jester's eyes as he spotted Alfred and Corporal Gareth, both dressed in inconspicuous civilian clothing, standing discreetly behind Eddie.
&quot;Oh look,&quot; Mr. Jester deadpanned, his voice laced with a hint of dry humor, &quot;if it isn't the commander of the Edward Welton army himself. Come in, come in, the more the merrier…&quot;
Eddie shifted his weight awkwardly under the journalist's gaze. &quot;Uh, thanks, Mr. Jester,&quot; he mumbled, ushering the crowd past the threshold.
The once-quiet apartment was now overflowing with a cacophony of sound – hushed conversations punctuated by sniffles and the shuffling of feet. Mr. Jester watched with a mixture of exasperation and begrudging admiration as the room filled to the brim. He closed the door with a soft thud, the sound barely audible over the growing din. Glancing down at his now-cold coffee staining the floor, he let out a defeated sigh.
&quot;So much for a quiet morning,&quot; he muttered to himself, the weariness evident in his voice.
Despite his frustration, a small, unexpected smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. As he surveyed the determined faces, the burning embers of hope in their eyes, a warmth bloomed in his chest. This wasn't just chaos; it was the spark of a rebellion, a testament to the unwavering spirit in the face of adversity. Mr. Jester straightened his shoulders, a newfound resolve settling in his gut. With a resolute nod, he turned back to his desk, the cacophony around him no longer a distraction, but a battle cry. He had a plan to finalize, and an army to lead.
-o-
The air crackled with a nervous energy that buzzed beneath the surface of grim determination. The golden light of dawn spilled through the partially open curtains, casting an uneven glow over the room. The outside world, with its usual cacophony, seemed miles away, its noise muffled by the walls that now served as a war room.
Mr. Jester's desk, usually a haven for his investigative endeavors, had been transformed into the heart of their operation. The clutter of personal projects had been replaced by a sprawling map of the city, illuminated by a harsh desk lamp. The once-crisp surface was now a battlefield of tactics; photographs of the missing, their hopeful smiles replaced by a stark urgency, lay scattered alongside police reports and hastily scribbled notes. A vintage notebook, its pages yellowed with age and filled with Mr. Jester's spidery handwriting, lay open, offering a glimpse into his years of relentless pursuit of the Black Hand.
One entire wall had been commandeered to serve a different kind of purpose. A large corkboard, adorned with a haphazard tapestry of clues, dominated the space. Pictures of the missing, some recent, some faded with worry, held prominent positions. Red yarn, a stark symbol of danger, connected them, weaving a chilling narrative of abduction. Notes scribbled on scraps of paper offered details: last seen, last heard, any leads, however insignificant. A timeline of events, meticulously drawn in blue ink, provided a grim roadmap of their disappearance.
Eddie, his voice echoing with a newfound gravitas, stood in the center of the room, addressing the assembled crowd. &quot;Everyone, this is Mr. Oswald Jester, the journalist I told you about. He's been digging into the Black Hand for years. And this,&quot; he gestured towards a tall man in relaxed civilian clothing, &quot;is my brother, 2nd Lieutenant Alfred Welton of the Argantheian Airforce. He's here to help us plan.&quot;
Mr. Jester, his gaze serious behind the thick lenses of his glasses, offered both the students and the soldiers a curt nod of acknowledgment. A flicker of something akin to respect, perhaps even gratitude, passed through the room.
&quot;Thank you, Mr. Welton,&quot; Mr. Jester said, his voice gruff but laced with a newfound urgency. &quot;Let's get to work.&quot;
Mr. Jester tapped a calloused finger against a photo pinned to the corkboard – a chilling black and white crest depicting a skull leering from behind a grasping black hand. &quot;As you're all likely aware,&quot; he began, his voice raspy with exhaustion but firm with resolve, &quot;we're dealing with the Ancient Order of the Black Hand.&quot;
A murmur rippled through the room, laced with a mixture of fear and grim recognition. Some faces, particularly the students, held a blank confusion that Alfred, standing beside Mr. Jester, made a mental note to address later.
&quot;The Black Hand,&quot; Mr. Jester continued, his gaze sweeping across the room, &quot;has a long and twisted history. Once a legitimate political party in Solivia, they advocated for unrestricted magical use, a philosophy that clashed violently with established laws and societal norms. A decade ago, their controversial practices led to their official disbandment. But,&quot; he leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, &quot;like a weed with tenacious roots, they've burrowed underground.&quot;
&quot;Operating in the shadows,&quot; Alfred interjected, picking up the thread, &quot;they've likely become a rogue organization, experimenting with forbidden magic and employing thugs like the ones you suspect took your friends, Will.&quot;
Will, his jaw clenched tight, mumbled a grim confirmation. &quot;So, mercenaries for these Black Hand goons. But where the hell are they taking them?&quot;
Mr. Jester straightened, his eyes flashing with a spark of something akin to rage. &quot;The kidnappings. Prominent in Archaea, it seems, but with tendrils reaching out to other major cities, including Edenfield. Their victims? Public figures, powerful magic users, or those who possess a coveted magical lineage, like your friend, Eddie.&quot;
Eddie's hand instinctively tightened around a worn photograph tucked in his pocket – Ashley, her bright smile a stark contrast to the grim reality of her disappearance. &quot;She came from a long line of witches,&quot; he confirmed, his voice thick with emotion. &quot;A campus activist, outspoken against injustice. Exactly the kind of target they'd go for.&quot;
Geralt, his face etched with worry, chimed in, &quot;Dominic too. Always digging into conspiracies, questioning authority. He fit their profile as well.&quot;
Mr. Jester nodded grimly. &quot;Indeed. My investigation, aided by some…unorthodox methods,&quot; he shot a pointed look at Alfred, who smirked in response, &quot;has uncovered a pattern. Traces of magical residue, dismissed as unrelated incidents, all lead to a single location – secret entrances into Archaea's Undercity.&quot;
A collective gasp filled the room. Christine, her eyes wide with disbelief, finally found her voice. &quot;The Undercity? You can't be serious!&quot;
Mr. Jester met her gaze head-on, a steely glint in his eyes. &quot;Serious as a heart attack, Ms. Jones. The Black Hand operates from a hidden base deep within its labyrinthine tunnels. They wear black hooded cloaks and iron masks – a mockery of Queen Isobel III, a final insult to the very monarchy that ostracized them.&quot; A grim smile played on his lips. &quot;Seems they haven't forgotten their past, have they?&quot;
He gestured towards a map of Archaea sprawled across the desk, a red circle marking a specific location. &quot;This,&quot; he declared, his voice ringing with a newfound purpose, &quot;is where we'll find them. This is where we'll find your loved ones.&quot;
Mr. Jester stepped back, a silent invitation for Alfred to take center stage. The journalist had laid the groundwork, painting a chilling picture of the enemy and their motives. Now, it was time for the soldier to step forward, to unveil the strategy they had been meticulously crafting.
&quot;Second Lieutenant Welton and I have been working on this investigation on and off, collaborating with his colleagues in the Argantheian military,&quot; Mr. Jester explained, gesturing towards Alfred. &quot;We've been discussing this for months, piecing together everything we could about the Black Hand and their potential hideout.&quot;
A sense of grim determination settled over the room as Mr. Jester acknowledged their joint effort. The weight of the situation, the potential dangers, hung heavy in the air.
Alfred strode forward, his military bearing evident despite his casual clothing. A confident smile played on his lips, a stark contrast to the worry etched on many faces around him.
&quot;Mr. Jester, if you please,&quot; he began, his voice surprisingly light considering the circumstances. &quot;Call me Alfred, everyone. Mr. Jester, I'm not used to being called by my rank outside the base.&quot; A hint of sheepishness colored his grin.
Mr. Jester chuckled, the sound a welcome break in the tension. &quot;Now, now,&quot; he said, clapping Alfred on the shoulder. &quot;No need to be so humble, Lieutenant. Go on, explain your grand plan!&quot;
Alfred cleared his throat, his amusement fading as he addressed the group. &quot;Alright then,&quot; he said, his voice turning serious. &quot;Based on Mr. Jester's intel and our own recon, we've identified key locations within the Undercity. Our plan is to infiltrate these spots simultaneously, a multi-pronged attack that will effectively cut off any escape routes for the Black Hand and free the captives.&quot;
He gestured towards the map sprawled across the desk, the red circle now pulsing with a new significance. &quot;This operation hinges on precision and coordination,&quot; he emphasized, his gaze sweeping across the room. &quot;This isn't just about brute force; it's about strategy. There are a few crucial things you all need to understand before we delve into the specifics of this mission.&quot;
The once cluttered desk had been transformed into a command center. A large map, procured through Mr. Jester's extensive network, dominated the surface. Pushpins of various colors marked key locations within the sprawling labyrinth of the Undercity, while detailed sketches and photographs offered a glimpse into the bowels of the Black Hand's presumed headquarters. Alfred, his voice infused with a newfound authority that surprised even Eddie, stood tall at the head of the makeshift table.
&quot;Alright, everyone, gather around!&quot; he boomed, his voice echoing in the tense silence of the room. This wasn't the soft, hesitant Alfred of their previous encounters; this was a soldier, a leader honed by years of military discipline.
With a flourish, he gestured towards the map. &quot;This,&quot; he declared, his pen tapping a designated spot, &quot;is the heart of the Black Hand's operation, their hidden lair deep within the Undercity. What we're about to embark on is a Raid Operation, a meticulously planned strike with a clear objective: to neutralize the enemy and liberate our captured loved ones.&quot;
His gaze swept across the room, meeting each pair of eyes with unwavering determination. &quot;This mission will be conducted in five distinct stages,&quot; he explained, his voice firm and clear. &quot;Each stage is crucial, a cog in the well-oiled machine that will lead us to victory.&quot;
He pointed to the first section of the map, his pen tracing a path towards the designated target. &quot;Stage one: Infiltration. We will approach the Black Hand's headquarters using routes that minimize detection. Stealth will be our greatest weapon. Cloaks and muted attire will be essential for this phase.&quot;
A sense of grim understanding settled over the room. They were no longer students, activists, or grieving families; they were a unit, bound by a shared purpose.
Alfred continued, his voice rising in intensity with each stage. &quot;Stage two: Isolation. We will establish a perimeter around the target zone, effectively cutting off any escape routes for the Black Hand or reinforcements. Disrupting their communication lines will be paramount, sowing confusion and hindering their ability to coordinate a defense.&quot;
His pen moved to a different section of the map, highlighting strategic positions. &quot;Stage three: Preparation. This is where our specialists come into play. Illusionists will create diversions, while destruction and alteration mages will be positioned to provide cover fire or manipulate the environment to our advantage.&quot;
A flicker of nervous excitement passed through the group. The students, many of whom possessed latent magical abilities, straightened in their seats, eager to contribute their unique skills to the mission.
&quot;Stage four: Assault. The main strike force will breach the enemy's defenses,&quot; Alfred declared, his voice resonating with a steely resolve. &quot;We will move swiftly, silently taking down any hostiles and securing the captives.&quot;
A collective breath was held as the weight of the final stage settled in.
&quot;Stage five: Extraction. With the captives secured, we retreat from the Undercity using pre-designated escape routes. This will be a critical stage, requiring unwavering focus and discipline to avoid the Black Hand's inevitable pursuit. The outskirts of Archaea will serve as our rendezvous point, a safe haven where we can regroup and ensure the safety of our rescued loved ones.&quot;
Alfred scanned the faces around him, searching for any sign of doubt or hesitation. But all he saw were eyes reflecting a steely determination, a mirror of his own. &quot;These stages are a framework,&quot; he explained, &quot;a roadmap to guide our actions. But remember, the battlefield is fluid. We must adapt to the situation as it unfolds, prioritizing the success of the mission and the safety of our team. Any questions?&quot;
Silence reigned. The weight of the plan, the risks involved, hung heavy in the air. But amidst the tension, a flicker of hope ignited. They were no longer a ragtag group; they were a raiding force, a band of heroes united in their quest for justice.
Alfred's gaze swept across the room, meeting each hesitant nod and determined expression. The silence was a testament to the gravity of the situation, the weight of the plan settling on their shoulders. But it wasn't fear that dominated the air, it was resolve. They were no longer civilians, but a team, a band of misfits united by a common purpose.
Seeing no immediate questions, Alfred pressed on, outlining the specific roles within the operation. &quot;To ensure a smooth operation,&quot; he declared, &quot;we'll be divided into five specialized elements, each crucial to our success.&quot;
A wave of hands shot up from the back of the room. It was Jake and Jane, the twins Will knew from his band days. Their streetwise demeanor instantly made them perfect candidates for the task.
&quot;We can handle recon,&quot; Jake announced, his voice laced with a confidence that belied the danger of their assignment. &quot;We know the underbelly of Archaea like the back of our hands. Getting in and out unseen? That's our specialty,&quot; he added with a wink towards his sister.
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jane chimed in, a mischievous glint in her eyes, &quot;cheap booze has its perks, wouldn't you say, Jake?&quot;
Alfred, recognizing their potential, offered a curt nod. &quot;Excellent. Jake and Jane, you'll be our recon team. Your job is to scout ahead, identify any potential threats, and ensure a clear path for the rest of us.&quot;
His gaze then shifted towards Henry, a quiet student with a surprising strength about him. &quot;Henry,&quot; Alfred addressed him, &quot;you and your friends will form the Security Element. You'll be responsible for disrupting the Black Hand's communication lines, essentially cutting them off from reinforcements and creating a communication blackout within their hideout.&quot;
A determined glint flickered in Henry's eyes. &quot;We're on it, Lieutenant,&quot; he said, a hint of pride coloring his voice. &quot;We'll make sure they can't call for help.&quot;
Alfred acknowledged his response with a satisfied nod, then turned to address the remaining students. &quot;The rest of you will join forces with Henry's group,&quot; he explained, &quot;providing additional muscle and ensuring a secure passage for the retrieval team.&quot; His gaze landed on Eddie and Will, a flicker of trust passing between them.
&quot;Eddie, Will,&quot; Alfred continued, his voice taking on a more serious tone, &quot;you two will be the Assault Element. Your primary objective: secure the captives. Get them out of that hideout as quickly and efficiently as possible.&quot;
The two friends exchanged a silent glance, a wordless oath of determination passing between them. With a resolute nod, they confirmed their acceptance of the daunting task.
Alfred's eyes then met Corporal Gareth's, his right-hand man in this operation. &quot;Corporal Gareth,&quot; he said, a hint of respect lacing his voice, &quot;you'll lead the Support Element. Once the Assault Team retrieves the captives, you'll be their extraction point, ready to whisk them away from the Undercity.&quot;
A curt nod from Gareth was his only response, but the steely glint in his eyes spoke volumes. He, like Alfred, understood the importance of their roles.
Finally, Alfred addressed Christine, Geralt, and their group from the Conjuration Department. &quot;You lot,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with a hint of amusement, &quot;will serve as our heavy hitters. If things get messy, we'll be counting on your destructive magic to provide cover fire.&quot;
Christine, perched precariously on the edge of Mr. Jester's kitchen counter, scoffed. &quot;Don't worry, Lieutenant,&quot; she retorted, her voice laced with a dangerous edge, &quot;we'll make sure they regret ever crossing us.&quot;
Alfred couldn't help but offer a wry smile at her bravado. He knew they packed a powerful punch, both magically and in terms of their unwavering determination.
His final words were directed towards Madeleine, a young woman with a gentle aura despite the circumstances. &quot;Once you've successfully escaped the Undercity,&quot; he explained, &quot;regroup at the designated rendezvous point on the outskirts of Archaea. Madeleine, Claire, and your friends from the healing faculty will be stationed there, ready to assess and treat any injuries.&quot;
&quot;We'll be prepared, Lieutenant,&quot; chirped Madeleine, her voice brimming with a quiet confidence.
A lone student, their voice barely a whisper, broke the tense silence. &quot;Casualties? Does that mean that we could…?&quot; they stammered, their eyes wide with fear.
&quot;Die?&quot; another student finished their question, their voice trembling.
Alfred met their gaze with a somber expression. &quot;There are no guarantees when entering enemy territory,&quot; he admitted. &quot;We must prepare for all possibilities. But know this,&quot; he continued, his voice firm and unwavering, &quot;our goal is to get everyone out of there alive as soon as possible.”
The air hung heavy in the room, thick with the weight of the information they had just absorbed. The briefing had painted a stark picture of the dangers that awaited them, and a tremor of fear ran through the group. Glances were exchanged, some filled with apprehension, others with a newfound resolve.
In that charged silence, Mr. Jester stepped forward, his voice a welcome anchor. &quot;Remember,&quot; he said, his gaze sweeping across the room, &quot;you're not embarking on this journey alone. We've planned meticulously, considered every angle, and we'll have your back every step of the way.&quot;
A collective breath seemed to ease the tension, a flicker of hope igniting in some eyes.
Alfred, sensing the shift in the atmosphere, relaxed his rigid posture. The steely commander melted away, replaced by the familiar Alfred Eddie knew – a man of quiet compassion and unwavering determination. &quot;Stick together,&quot; he said, his voice softer now, &quot;stay focused on the mission at hand. Your courage in being here, in facing this danger head-on, is already a testament to your strength. We'll get them back, I have no doubt.&quot;
His words, laced with a quiet confidence, resonated through the room. A spark of determination flickered in each pair of eyes, replacing the initial fear with a steely resolve.
They were no longer just students, activists, or grieving families. In that moment, they were a unit, bound by a shared purpose, a common enemy. They had a plan, a team of experienced allies, and the unwavering belief in their mission. The weight of the unknown still pressed down on them, but beneath it, a newfound strength had taken root. They were ready.
As the weight of the briefing settled in, the initial shock gave way to a grim determination. The students, Eddie, Will, Henry, Madeleine, Claire, Christine, Geralt, and the rest, gathered their belongings. Fear still lingered in their eyes, a shadow cast by the dangers they were about to face. Even Christine, known for her brash fearlessness, couldn't entirely mask the tremor in her hand.
But alongside the fear, a steely resolve had taken root. Alfred's unwavering confidence and Mr. Jester's unwavering support had instilled a flicker of hope that burned brighter than the fear. They were a team now, a motley crew of students, activists, and healers transformed by a shared purpose.
With strategic plans etched in their minds and a newfound sense of unity pulsing through the group, they prepared to step into the night. The air outside was thick with anticipation, the weight of the unknown pressing down on them. Yet, their fear was tempered by a newfound resolve. They were no longer just individuals – they were a unit, bound by love, courage, and a desperate yearning to bring their friends home.
&quot;We'll commence the operation tomorrow morning,&quot; Mr. Jester announced, his voice cutting through the tension. &quot;We'll split up and meet at designated locations in Archaea. Does that work for everyone?&quot;
A chorus of nods rose from the group. A plan had been laid out, roles assigned, and a silent oath sworn. They were ready.
A small smile played on Henry's lips. &quot;I can take us to Archaea in my car,&quot; he offered, looking at Eddie, Will, Madeleine, and Claire. A playful jab followed. &quot;Just make sure Will doesn't light up another cigarette in my car, alright?&quot;
Will feigned offense, but a grin tugged at the corners of his lips. &quot;Hey!&quot; he protested, injecting a much-needed dose of levity into the tense atmosphere. &quot;Seriously, Henry, now's not the time to bring up my smoking habits.&quot;
The light banter, a shared memory from simpler times, brought a wave of comfort to the room. Maybe, just maybe, they could get through this, together. They had each other, a cunning plan, and a fierce determination. And with a flicker of hope burning bright, they stepped out into the night, ready to face the darkness that awaited them in the Undercity. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1E V3</Title>
            <Text>The first thing to surface from the black, syrupy nothingness was sound. Before thought or sight, there were voices, muffled and distant, swimming in and out of focus like a badly tuned radio. Words would occasionally break through the static hiss before being swallowed again. Gradually, two distinct voices emerged: a low, concerned baritone acting as an anchor in the noise, and a lighter, skeptical Californian drawl that rose and fell with restless energy.
&quot;...wasn't human, Will. The way it moved… it just leapt. Cleared the library wall in a single bound after I hit it with a kinetic blast. Then it was just gone. Vanished into the arboretum.&quot;
&quot;Dude, seriously? Henry, you've been mainlining coffee and cramming for your Automaton thesis for like, a week straight. Maybe you were seeing things? No offense, but the library is super creepy after curfew.&quot;
&quot;I know what I saw, Ashley. It was crouched over Eddie. If I hadn't come along when I did…&quot; A pause, heavy with unspoken fear. &quot;I'm telling you, it was wrong. Unnatural.&quot;
&quot;And I'm telling you, you're stressed. We're all stressed. Let's just be glad Eddie's okay before we start hunting for, like, the Mothman of Edenfield.&quot;
&quot;It's not—&quot;
A groan sliced through their argument. Eddie’s own.
His eyelids felt like lead shutters. He peeled them open to a blurry, white ceiling. The sharp, sterile scent of antiseptic and healing potions flooded his senses, confirming his location: the campus infirmary. He pushed himself up on his elbows, his head throbbing, and tried to swing his legs over the side of the bed.
A bolt of white-hot agony shot up from his left ankle, so intense it stole his breath and made his vision flash. He collapsed back onto the pillows with a sharp hiss of pain.
&quot;Eddie!&quot; Will was at his side in an instant, his hands hovering, unsure where to touch. &quot;Easy, mate. Just lay back. The healers said your leg got twisted up badly when you fell. They had to mend a fracture.&quot;
Ashley leaned into his view, a weak smile on her face that didn't quite reach her worried eyes. &quot;Hey, at least it's not missing. You'd make a totally bogus pirate.&quot;
&quot;You're awake at least,&quot; Henry said, a wave of relief washing over his face. &quot;How are you feeling? You took quite a nasty blow on your leg.&quot;
&quot;Yeah… Figures,&quot; Eddie managed, his voice a dry rasp. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, the world tilting precariously. &quot;What… what happened? I was in the library…&quot;
&quot;That's what we were hoping you could tell us,&quot; Will said, his tone grim. &quot;Henry found you unconscious in the alley behind the Archives.&quot;
Eddie squeezed his eyes shut, trying to pierce the fog in his mind. The library… yes. He'd been heading back to the dorm, taking the shortcut. It was late. The air was cold. He remembered the rustle of leaves behind him, a sound that was too loud, too close. He’d turned, and then… nothing. Just a black hole in his memory.

            <Title>Chapter 10</Title>
            <Text>A couple of days had passed since that night, it is Sunday morning now, despite that fact, the word from Catherine still hadn’t left Eddie’s mind at all, it kept spinning, and playing like a broken record in his mind, mocking him in his futile attempt at hiding his passion for Alchemy.
The living room of the Welton’s household is cozy today, the low table cluttered with herbs and parchments. The warm morning lights casts a ray of sunshine shimmering through between the curtains, casting onto the mismatched furniture where Eddie sat. Torrie sat across from him sprawling on the carpet, her legs kicking as she flipped through her notebook, her wand resting on top of her ears as she flipped through her notes.
“So,” She said, breaking the silence, “You were at Vandruff’s Travelling Puppet Show last night, weren’t you, Eddie?” Torrie teased, her voice was sing-song in tone.
“What? No! Of course not!” Eddie countered, “What makes you think that?”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Torrie’s smirk widened, “Maybe because my classmate’s brother who worked part-time as a ticket seller with Mr. Vandruff said he saw someone with a dishevelled silver hair sitting in the back row, looking all serious and broody. It was nothing he had ever seen before! An adult in a kid’s travelling puppet show! Sounds familliar?” She continued her tease, her grin widening.
Eddie groaned, covering his face with Torrie’s Alchemy Textbook, his groan muffled. “Look, there are plenty of people with dishevelled silver hair who enjoy puppet shows, alright? Leave them alone!” he muttered, the sound still muffled by his textbook.
Torrie laughed, her legs kicking before she sat up, “Oh come on, Eddie! You’re a terrible liar! You’ve got that look, you know? Just admit you’ve been there!”
“Look,” Eddie shot back, putting down the textbook that has been hiding his face, “Do you want help with your homework or not? If not, I’ve got better things to do.”
Her laughter softened into a giggle, “Fine, fine. But seriously, what’s so bad about going to a puppet show anyway? They’re so fun!”
Eddie lets out a long sigh, running a hand through his hair—an unintentional act that only made it messier. “It’s not about that, Torrie. It’s just… you know what, never mind. Let’s focus on your homework, okay?”
“Alright then, grumpy.” Torrie said with a mock pout, then joined Eddie on the low table.
But before Eddie could start working on the first assignment, the front door opened, he had expected it to be his father coming home early from shopping for ingredients, but as the front door opens, it was someone he didn’t expect.
It was Markus.
Eddie glanced up, clearly puzzled. It was Sunday morning—Markus isn't supposed to be working today. His expression softened as Markus set down a small bag of supplies and adjusted his jacket. 
“Oh hey Markus.” Eddie greeted, slightly raising an eyebrow, “What’s going on? It’s Sunday, you’re supposed to be on break, right? Or were you transferred to weekend shift or something?”
“Oh hey Eddie,” Markus greeted back sheepishly, “Sorry I forgot to give you a heads up.”
“It’s alright,” Eddie chuckled, “What’s on your mind today? You wanna help Torrie with her homework with me?”
“Oh no, I’m good, I’m not really good with that stuff.” Markus said, settling on the chair by the door, “The Elf lady called me yesterday, saying that she needed me for something, willing to give me something for the trouble too! Generous, right?”
“Oh wow, that’s interesting--” But something caught Eddie’s attention, a discrepancy.
“Wait… Elf Lady?” Eddie blinked, “What Elf Lady?”
“You know… Man, I forgot her name, but red hair? Short? Red coat? She almost wear all-red now that you mention it.”
“Wait…” Eddie tries to dig his brains for faces, “Catherine?”
“Yes! That’s the one, the Catherine fellow called me.”
“What the bloody hell does Catherine wants with you, Markus?” Eddie said, puzzled, “Hope she didn’t tangle you in her shady businesses, She’s a pretty shady person if you can see through her wacky personality.”
“Oh, nothing shady, but she mentions something about an Adventure, though.”
Eddie’s heart drops, an Adventure… wait… does this mean…
“No, no, no…” Eddie muttered under his breath, “Are you sure she said adventure? She can’t be that vague right?”
“Well, she is pretty vague, but I’m sure-“
“Hey Markus!” Torrie interjected, “Did Aunt Catherine invite you too?! She was gathering a party to go on an epic adventure to the woods! She said I can come by!”
Wait, wait, wait. Eddie thought, his mind beginning to spiral.
“Wait, Torrie. What are you talking about?” Eddie said
“Didn’t you know, Eddie? Aunt Catherine is gathering an adventure party!”
But before Eddie could respond, the door opened once more, he couldn’t make of the face at first due to the bright morning light, but from the silhouette it was clear. Short hair, and sharp, elven ear.
It was Catherine
“Mornin’ everyone!” She chirped, &quot;Well, I see everyone is here,&quot; she continued, setting down the bags of grocery on the low table. She turned to Eddie with a teasing glint in her eye. &quot;What's all this fuss about?&quot; 
“Catherine, you’ve gotta adress something for me.” Eddie said sternly, his face is a mix of confusion and frustation, “What the hell is going on. Why is Markus clocking in on a Sunday morning, and most importantly. Why are you involving my fucking sister into this?”
“Language, Eddie!” Torrie shouted from the low table.
“Well, firstly.” Catherine said, her tone is matter-factly, “I said a few days ago, right? I was planning an excursion to the Deep Glaive. It wouldn’t be a balanced party if was just two Alchemists isn’t it? So I decided to recruit more!”
“You what?!” Eddie shouted, standing abruptly. Textbooks pens and notebook falling down to the low table.
“What’s wrong, Ed?! She said it will be an exciting adventure! There’s nothing wrong with it!” Torrie plead
“Look, there is so many things wrong with this, Torrie. Firstly, you are involved! Do you know how dangerous this is?!”
“Oh, I think you’re overthinking this, Edward.” Catherine said, brushing off her hands in front of her face, “It’ll be just a little adventure! A bit of detour, if you will. I mean- come on, you were exploring an even more dangerous dungeons when you were her age!”
“Look, Catherine. It’s different, she’s different!”
“She’ll be fine.” Catherine said, “It’ll be like the old times!”
Eddie's heart sank. He looked at his little sister, who was still so young, so eager to prove herself. He glanced at Catherine, the woman who had once been his mentor and aunt, now standing so confidently before him, acting like nothing was wrong. 
 He opened his mouth to argue again, but then he turned to his mother, Alyssa Welton. Who just entered to the kitchen across the room, hoping for some sense. &quot;Mom!&quot; he called out, his voice tinged with frustration. &quot;Are you listening? Are you okay with this? Why isn't anyone thinking straight about this?&quot; 
Alyssa, who had been arranging the groceries Catherine just bought, turned around, her expression warm but unreadable. &quot;I trust Catherine. She's always been dependable in her way. She gets you in and out of dungeons in the past, although I can argue all I want, I know she’ll find her way to get you guys out. Let’s just say if she's confident, this will work out, I believe her.&quot; 
Eddie stared at her. &quot;You believe her? Just like that? What happened to thinking things through? What happened to being cautious?&quot; 
Alyssa smiled softly as she took out a carrot out of the grocery bag and putting it on the chopping board, “Eddie, sometimes you have to trust people and take a leap. You haven’t gone to adventures like these since Alfred goes to the army haven’t you?”
“In fact,” She continued, her chopping sounded harder against the carrots.
“If anything happens to any of you..”
Chop,
“I can just hold a certain Elf accountable can I?”
Another chop,
Catherine lets out a deep gulp, “Y-you heard your mother, Edward.” She said, “I’ll make sure to keep you guys safe!”
Alyssa’s chopping began to soften again, “If you are going, Eddie. You'd better get prepared. You should have your things ready in the garage.&quot; 
Eddie felt a sharp sting in his chest. Was his mother, the one who always kept a careful eye on things, saying this? He wasn't sure if it was reassuring or terrifying. His mind was still racing, caught between his fears and the urge to protect his family from the reckless dangers that seemed spiralling out of control. 
He clenched his fists, turning to Catherine again. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said gritting his teeth. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 18E</Title>
            <Text>as Henry's words echoed through the room. &quot;We have to get out, now!&quot; His voice, usually full of bravado, held a tremor of urgency that mirrored the fear gnawing at Eddie's gut.
Will, still clutching his battered guitar, frowned in confusion. &quot;Lord Raven? Who is he?&quot; The name sent a shiver down Christine's spine, her usually composed demeanor replaced by raw terror.
&quot;Look,&quot; she said, her voice barely a whisper, &quot;I don't know all the details, alright? We saw him at the entrance. But trust me, you don't want to meet him.&quot; She gestured towards her chest. &quot;I can feel his presence, a dark energy unlike anything I've ever encountered. We need to leave, and fast.&quot;
Eddie's gaze flickered between Christine's panicked expression and the lifeless form of Walt. Her words, though lacking in specifics, rang true. Christine's lineage as a sorceress honed her senses to arcane energies, and the fear that choked her voice spoke volumes.
&quot;But where can we go?&quot; he wondered aloud. The entrance was effectively blocked by the imposing figure of Lord Raven. The very thought of facing him directly sent a wave of nausea washing over Eddie.
As if sensing the urgency, Ashley, ever the resourceful one, spoke up. &quot;There's a hidden stairway leading deeper into the fortress. It's where the cultists… dispose of bodies.&quot; Her voice trailed off, a hint of disgust flickering across her face. &quot;It might lead to an exit.&quot;
Christine recoiled, her nose wrinkling in disgust. &quot;Are you serious? A body chute? What if it leads to some monstrous pit? What if they…&quot; She trailed off, her voice thick with dread.
&quot;We don't have a choice,&quot; Eddie interrupted, his voice firm despite the growing panic gnawing at him. He could feel it too now – a malevolent pressure building in the air, a tangible manifestation of Lord Raven's approaching presence. Time was running out.
The group exchanged hesitant glances, the weight of the situation settling upon them. Facing Lord Raven meant certain defeat, perhaps even death. The body chute, however repulsive, offered a glimmer of hope. With a silent nod of agreement, they followed Ashley, her knowledge of the fortress now their only advantage. The remaining captives, their faces etched with terror, stumbled after them, their only solace the meager protection offered by the heroes leading them.
As they hurried towards the hidden staircase, the rhythmic clang of Lord Raven's iron boots against the stone floor echoed through the chamber, growing louder and closer with each passing second. They were running against time, a desperate race for survival that would lead them into the heart of darkness itself.
-o-
he eerie silence of the now empty cellars was broken by the ominous clanking of iron boots as Lord Raven entered the room. His imposing figure filled the space with a palpable sense of disappointment and anger. Behind him, a group of cultists watched in silent fear, their eyes wide with trepidation. Walt and Fred, both battered and bruised from their previous encounters, stood among them, their expressions tense.
Lord Raven's gaze swept across the open cell doors, the absence of captives a glaring failure. His masked face betrayed no emotion, but the air around him seemed to grow colder with his displeasure. His attention finally fixed on the stairway leading down into the darker depths of the fortress.
&quot;After them,&quot; he commanded, his voice like a death knell. He extended a sharp, clawed gauntlet from beneath his cloak, pointing towards the stairway. &quot;Don't let them escape.&quot;
&quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; Walt responded, his voice steady despite the fear gnawing at his insides. He immediately began to move towards the stairway, determination in his steps.
Lord Raven's voice, however, did not cease, its chilling authority filling the room. &quot;If the sacrificial vessel does not meet its numbers by midnight,&quot; he continued, his tone cold and final, &quot;you and your men shall be the substitutes.&quot;
Fred felt a shiver run down his spine, his mouth dry as he swallowed hard. &quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; he managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper. With a last glance at the terrifying figure of Lord Raven, he followed Walt towards the staircase.
As they descended, the air grew heavier, the pressure of their impending doom pushing them forward with desperate haste. The cultists knew that failure was not an option—they had to capture the escapees or face the unthinkable wrath of their master.
-o-
The cramped passageway twisted and turned, its walls slick with moisture and the occasional glint of moonlight filtering through unseen cracks. The growls echoed closer, a guttural symphony of hunger that sent chills down Eddie's spine. The captives, huddled together in the center of their group, whimpered in fear, their ragged breaths a stark contrast to the oppressive silence that had settled before the beast arrived.
Suddenly, Ashley, leading the way with her bioluminescent vial, stopped short. The green glow illuminated a gaping maw of darkness ahead – a cavern entrance far larger than the passage they had been navigating. The growls seemed to emanate from within, a chorus of monstrous voices that vibrated in their chests.
&quot;Dead end,&quot; Ashley hissed, her voice tight with frustration. Despair threatened to engulf Eddie, but he quickly pushed it down. Panic wouldn't help them now. He needed a plan, a way out of this subterranean nightmare.
&quot;Is there another passage?&quot; Eddie whispered, his gaze flickering between the cavern entrance and the terrified faces behind him.
Christine shook her head, her brow furrowed in concentration. &quot;There might be a hidden tunnel system deeper within the fortress, but even if I knew where it was, activating it would likely take time we don't have.&quot;
Will, ever the optimist, spoke up, a hint of defiance in his voice. &quot;Maybe we can talk our way out of this? A little serenade for our furry friends?&quot; He offered a strained smile, but the worry in his eyes was undeniable.
&quot;Not likely,&quot; Geralt muttered, his hand resting on the hilt of his silver sword. &quot;Those are no ordinary beasts. They're bred for one purpose - to eliminate threats.&quot;
The ground trembled beneath their feet as a monstrous silhouette emerged from the cavern entrance. A hulking creature, all fangs and claws, with a stench that made Eddie's stomach churn, stood before them, blocking their escape.
Eddie knew then that talking wouldn't save them. This was a fight for survival, a desperate gamble against the horrors that lurked in the underbelly of the fortress. He reached into his satchel, his hand closing around the vial of potion. It was a desperate gamble, a concoction designed to weaken magical creatures, but it was their only hope.
&quot;We fight,&quot; Eddie declared, his voice ringing with newfound resolve. He uncorked the potion and splashed it onto his weapon. &quot;Stay close, everyone. We take down this beast together!&quot;
With a battle cry that echoed through the cavern, Eddie charged forward, the heroes and the terrified captives following close behind. The claustrophobic tunnel erupted into chaos as the fight for survival began.
Eddie, Will, Ashley, and the rest of the group hurried through the narrow passageways, the flickering torchlight casting eerie shadows on the damp stone walls. The oppressive atmosphere and the distant growls kept everyone on edge, each sound amplifying their fear.
Henry, at the rear, heard the clanking of iron boots echoing from the stairway. His heart sank. &quot;They're coming,&quot; he whispered urgently to Christine and Geralt.
Christine's face tightened with fear and determination. &quot;We need to move faster,&quot; she urged, pushing the captives to pick up the pace.
As they rounded a corner, Ashley spotted a faint light ahead. &quot;There! That might be a way out!&quot;
But before they could reach it, a dark figure appeared at the end of the passage. Walt, his eyes filled with a sinister resolve, blocked their path. Fred and a few other cultists flanked him, their expressions mirroring his.
&quot;End of the line,&quot; Walt sneered, raising his hand to summon dark energy.
Eddie, Ashley, and Will braced themselves, their earlier exhaustion and fear momentarily forgotten as they prepared for another fight. They knew they couldn't afford to lose now—not when freedom was so close.
But just as the two sides were about to clash, a blinding light filled the tunnel. Christine and Geralt had arrived, their conjuration magic creating a temporary barrier that sent Walt and the cultists reeling.
The air crackled with raw energy as Christine and Geralt unleashed their conjuration. A shimmering wall of force materialized in the tunnel, momentarily halting Walt and his cultist reinforcements. But the barrier wouldn't hold for long. Desperation gnawed at Eddie, his gaze flickering between the fading light filtering through the hidden passage Ashley had spotted and the growing menace of the approaching figures.
&quot;Go!&quot; Christine's voice echoed, laced with an urgency that left no room for argument. &quot;Take the captives and get out of here!&quot;
Eddie looked around at his companions. Will, his face etched with determination, gripped his guitar tighter. Ashley stood resolute, her staff crackling with a faint blue light. He knew they shared his reluctance to leave, but the weight of responsibility for the terrified faces behind them settled upon his shoulders.
&quot;We'll buy you time,&quot; Geralt added, his voice stoic but his hand hovering near the hilt of his silver sword. He met Eddie's gaze, a silent understanding passing between them.
With a heavy heart, Eddie turned towards the captives. &quot;Everyone,&quot; he addressed them, his voice hoarse but firm, &quot;follow Ashley. There's a possible exit ahead. Don't look back, just keep moving.&quot;
A ripple of fear and uncertainty went through the group, but they eventually began to shuffle towards the faint light at the end of the passage, Ashley leading the way. Eddie watched them go, a knot of worry tightening in his gut, before turning back to face the oncoming threat.
Will grinned, a touch manic in the flickering light. &quot;Looks like it's time for a farewell concert, wouldn't you say, Ed?&quot; He strummed a discordant chord, the amp buzzing to life.
Eddie gripped the potion vial, a grim smile mirroring Will's. &quot;Let's give them a show they won't forget.&quot;
As Walt and the cultists charged forward, the heroes of this desperate tale stood their ground, ready to face the darkness head-on. The narrow passage became their stage, bathed in an eerie glow, and the battle for escape a fierce symphony of clashing steel, pulsating magic, and the defiant roar of a guitar.
Just as the cultists began to close in, a roaring sound filled the tunnel. The engine of a truck echoed through the passageway, and moments later, a military vehicle skidded to a halt, its tires screeching against the stone floor. The back of the truck swung open, and Corporal Gareth emerged, his expression determined.
&quot;Move! Get them inside!&quot; he shouted, waving the captives towards the truck.
The students urged the captives to quickly climb into the vehicle, holding their defensive positions as the cultists drew nearer. One by one, Christine, Geralt, and Henry fell back towards the truck, their magical attacks keeping the cultists at bay.
Finally, only Eddie, Will, and Ashley remained, standing firm as the last line of defense. As the captives scrambled into the truck, a figure stepped out of the vehicle and walked towards them. It was Madam Ingram, the retired Company Captain of the Royal Paladins. Her presence radiated authority and strength, even in the direst of circumstances.
&quot;Go inside the truck, dear,&quot; she spoke softly but with unyielding determination. &quot;I'll handle them.&quot;
&quot;But, Madam Ingram—&quot; Eddie began, his voice filled with concern.
&quot;This is not a students' battle anymore,&quot; she said, her tone final as she drew her mace and battle staff. &quot;This is my business.&quot;
The three students hesitated, their loyalty and sense of duty pulling them in different directions. But Madam Ingram's steely gaze left no room for argument. Reluctantly, Eddie, Will, and Ashley began to retreat towards the truck, joining the others.
As they climbed into the vehicle, they couldn't help but look back at Madam Ingram. She stood tall and resolute, facing the oncoming cultists and beasts with the unwavering confidence of a seasoned warrior. Her presence was a beacon of hope in the chaos.
With everyone safely aboard, Corporal Gareth revved the engine and the truck lurched forward, speeding away from the fortress. The students watched through the back as Madam Ingram confronted the cultists, her battle staff and mace glowing with a fierce light.
As the fortress receded into the distance, Eddie, Will, and Ashley shared a look of mixed relief and determination. They had escaped this time, but the battle against the Black Hand and Lord Raven was far from over. They knew they would need to regroup, plan, and fight again. But for now, they had survived, thanks to the bravery of their friends and the selfless sacrifice of Madam Ingram.
The truck roared into the night, carrying the exhausted but resolute group towards safety, leaving the horrors of the fortress behind.
As the armored truck rumbled through the dark tunnels of the Undercity, the tension inside palpable. Eddie sat near the back, his eyes scanning the faces of his friends and the rescued captives. Relief mingled with exhaustion as they tried to catch their breath. But Eddie’s thoughts were elsewhere, nagging at the back of his mind.
He glanced back towards the fortress, the image of Madam Ingram standing defiantly against the cultists etched in his memory. A surge of worry hit him, and he quickly turned to Corporal Gareth, who was focused on navigating the treacherous path.
&quot;Corporal Gareth!&quot; Eddie shouted over the engine’s roar. &quot;We’re missing Madam Ingram! She’s still back there!&quot;
Gareth’s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, meeting Eddie’s concerned gaze. He didn’t slow down. &quot;It was Madam Ingram’s order to leave her behind,&quot; he said, his voice steady but tinged with respect and a hint of sadness. &quot;She said she had unresolved business and that she’d extract back another way.&quot;
Eddie's heart sank. He knew Madam Ingram was more than capable, but the thought of her alone in that place filled him with dread. &quot;Are you sure she’ll be alright?&quot; he pressed, unable to hide the worry in his voice.
Corporal Gareth nodded firmly. &quot;Madam Ingram is one of the best. If anyone can handle themselves in there, it’s her. Trust her judgment. She knew what she was doing.&quot;
Ashley, overhearing the conversation, placed a reassuring hand on Eddie’s shoulder. &quot;She’s a seasoned warrior, Eddie. She’ll make it.&quot;
Eddie nodded, trying to take comfort in their words. He turned to look at Will, who was silently strumming his guitar, the music a soothing counterpoint to the chaos they had just escaped. Will caught his eye and gave a small nod, offering silent support.
Christine, still visibly shaken but regaining her composure, moved closer to Eddie. &quot;We did what we had to do,&quot; she said softly. &quot;We need to focus on getting these people to safety. Madam Ingram will find her way back.&quot;
Eddie took a deep breath and nodded, resolving to trust in Madam Ingram’s capabilities. The truck sped on, the dark tunnels gradually giving way to the faint promise of light and safety.

            <Title>Chapter 24 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>Catherine stood squarely before the dragon, her earlier wounds seemingly erased, as if the very concept of pain had never touched her. Elves were said to heal fast, their bodies resilient beyond mortal comprehension—but seeing it firsthand, seeing her move with such precision, was nothing short of myth made real.
She lifted her staff, then a shattered column from the ruins trembled, it shot forward like a cannonball—hurtling straight at the dragon’s face.
The beast turned sharply—just in time for the debris to smash against its snout.
The strike wasn’t enough to harm it.
But it was enough to enrage it.
The dragon’s five glowing eyes flared with fury.
It let out a guttural snarl, jaws snapping, and lunged toward Catherine, moving like a shadow, a blur of ice and malice.
Catherine rolled beneath it, slipping under the beast’s massive body with the grace of wind itself. She glided over the frozen rubble, weightless, effortless, as if the world itself bent to her will.
Then—her, “Edward! The gunpowder! Now!”
Eddie didn’t hesitate.
He tore the ammunition satchel from his shoulder and hurled it toward her.
Catherine caught it—
Or rather, she didn’t.
The satchel never touched her hands. Instead, it hovered, suspended in mid-air, caught in the torrents of wind spiraling around her.
And then—she, too, was floating.
Eddie’s breath caught.
His injuries, the pain in his ribs momentarily forgotten.
Catherine held her staff aloft, eyes glowing like embers, and spoke in a tongue older than time itself.
It was Elvish—but not the kind Eddie had ever heard before.
Older… More ancient… More primal…
Then—light.
A large transmutation circle flared beneath her, its glow casting shifting shadows across the ruins.
And then—more.
Circles ignited one after another, rising, expanding, multiplying—until the very sky burned with their radiance.
Orange, Red. Like the sun had shattered, as if she had called upon the sun itself into the night, and its fragments had been sewn into the heavens.
Eddie could barely breathe.
The dragon turned.
And in the beast’s many eyes, reflected in the glow of the spiraling sigils above, Eddie saw something he had never seen before in a beast.
Not anger.
Nor rage.
But Fear.
Then—Catherine brought her staff down.
Like an executioner’s axe.
Like a warlord commanding an army.
Like a knight delivering the final blow.
And from the transmutation circles… Fire.
At first, fireballs.
Then more of them…
Until eventually… a fire storm.
A maelstrom of molten lead and infernal flames rained down upon the Nightingale Dragon.
Each blast pierced its obsidian scales, the molten metal searing through its hide, embedding into flesh.
The dragon shrieked in agony.
It staggered.
It lurched back, trying to shield itself with its wings—but the firestorm was unstoppable.
Catherine pushed forward.
With every step she took, the inferno intensified.
The dragon backed away.
One step.
Another.
And then—
It spread its wings.
A single, powerful beat sent a shockwave of dust and debris spiraling into the air.
The beast hurled itself backward, rising—slowly at first, then faster, faster, until it was nothing but a dark silhouette against the burning sky.
Catherine lifted her gaze.
The dragon let out one final, piercing shriek—
And then—
It was gone.
The transmutation circles dimmed.
The firestorm ceased.
Catherine floated back down, her feet touching the frostbitten stone as the winds gently set her down.
The satchel fell beside her, the remaining bullets clinking softly against the frozen ground.
Then—
Silence.
The ruins of Craemonia stood still.

-o-
The ruins had fallen silent.
The acrid scent of burnt stone and charred scales still clung to the night air, mixing with the damp earth beneath them. Smoke curled lazily into the sky, blotting out the moon in murky tendrils. The battle was over, but the weight of it still pressed on them, settling into the quiet.
Eddie sat propped against a broken pillar, his body a tapestry of bruises, burns, and deep, aching exhaustion. His right arm throbbed—dislocated, maybe broken. His ribs ached with every breath. Blood dried in jagged streaks along his temple. He had felt worse. But not by much.
Catherine knelt beside him, her fingers deftly grinding herbs and crushed roots into a thick salve. The Codex—the ancient tome they had come for—was now securely strapped to her belt in a leather book holster, its weight a reminder that their mission, at least, was a success.
She worked in focused silence, her movements quick, practiced—too practiced. This wasn’t the first time she’d patched someone up in the field.
“Foolish of a Welton, you’re no different from your father.” she muttered under her breath, dabbing the salve onto a particularly nasty bruise along Eddie’s jaw. It burned.
Eddie hissed, his body tensing.
Catherine scoffed. “Oh, don’t be dramatic.”
“You could at least warn me,” he grumbled.
She rolled her eyes, applying another layer with absolutely no regard for his comfort. “If you had half an intellect about you, you wouldn’t have jumped into the fight like that. You nearly got yourself killed.”
Eddie let out a breathy chuckle, though it ended in a wince. “You’re welcome, by the way.”
Catherine paused. Just for a second.
Then, without looking up, she murmured, “I couldn’t find a proper ignition source.” She rubbed the salve into his shoulder, her touch firm but careful. “If you hadn’t brought the gunpowder... I would have lost.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard by the quiet admission.
She didn’t elaborate. Didn’t need to.
Instead, she reached for his arm, fingers hovering just above the dislocated shoulder. “This is going to hurt.”
Before he could protest, she jerked it back into place.
A sharp, searing pain shot through his body. Eddie bit down a curse, his vision going white at the edges. For a moment, all he could do was sit there, breathless, waiting for the pain to dull into a manageable throb.
Catherine, to her credit, at least had the decency to look mildly guilty. “It needed to be done.”
Eddie groaned. “Next time—give me a damn warning.”
A ghost of a smile flickered across her lips. “I’ll think about it.”
She busied herself again, checking over his wounds, ensuring there was nothing worse she had missed. The night stretched on in silence, the only sound the crackling embers of dying flames in the distance.
Then, quietly—too casually—Catherine spoke.
“You never told me you were expelled from Aella Academy...”
Eddie hesitated.
His gaze flickered to the ground, fingers idly tracing patterns in the dust. Aella Academy. The name alone sat heavy on his tongue, like a stone he couldn’t quite swallow.
“I... um...” he started, then faltered.
Catherine didn’t push, not right away. She simply watched him, waiting. Unyielding, but patient.
Then, in a quieter voice, she said, “Markus told me everything.”
Eddie’s stomach twisted.
“I want to hear the story from you.”
He swallowed. His gaze flickered toward the ruined path, the smoldering embers in the distance. Everything ached—his body, his head, his pride.
&quot;It’s...&quot; he exhaled, &quot;...a long story, Catherine.&quot;
She let out a small, amused sigh as she dipped a clean strip of cloth into the salve.
“Well,” she mused, pressing it gently against one of his deeper bruises. Eddie tensed at the sting, but Catherine barely seemed to notice. “We’ve got all the time in the world now.”
&quot;It’s not like the dragon’s coming back anytime soon.&quot; She gave a small chuckle at that, as if trying to ease the weight in the air.
Then, more softly, “So... how did it go?”
Eddie exhaled slowly.
For a moment, he just listened—to the crackle of distant embers, the whisper of the wind through broken stone. To the quiet.
Then, at last—
&quot;His name was Davies… Davies Mortimer… He was the one I duelled—&quot; Eddie began
The memory coiled around him, suffocating. His fingers twitched, then clenched into a fist.
“I scarred him, Catherine.” His voice barely rose above a whisper.
She stilled, the cloth in her hands forgotten.
“Not just a mark,” he continued, the weight of it pressing down on his chest. “A permanent burn scar so large, I don’t know if it ever healed.”
The firelight flickered between them, casting long, shifting shadows across the ruined stones. Catherine said nothing, waiting.
Eddie exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “I didn’t just hurt him… I ruined him.”
The night pressed in, cold and unyielding. It gnawed at his skin, but the ice settling in his gut was far worse.
“And all I could think was—” his voice cracked, breath unsteady. His heartbeat pounded in his ears. “I was a monster.”
He could still see their faces. The stares. The unspoken verdict.
His fists tightened, nails digging into his palms, but the ache was distant—nothing compared to the weight in his chest.
And then, after a long silence, he whispered, “Maybe they were right.”
He swallowed hard, the words thick in his throat.
“And I—I couldn’t bear it. Not anymore. I was done.”
His fists clenched, nails digging into his palms. The bitterness burned, hot and sharp.
“So when the academy expelled me…” He let out a hollow laugh, devoid of warmth. “Part of me was relieved.”
The fire crackled between them, filling the silence where his certainty should have been.
“It was an excuse. A reason to walk away. To leave it all behind. To finally be free of that world. That power. To stop being this… thing everyone had to fear.”
His voice trembled on the last word.
The confession left him raw, exposed. He forced himself to look at Catherine, bracing for judgment, for disgust—
But she only watched him, quiet.
Eddie exhaled, a shuddering breath. He ran a hand down his face, fingers curling against his jaw.
“But deep down…” His voice dropped to a whisper, haunted. “I can’t leave it. I can’t run from it. It’s a part of me. I can’t escape. No matter what.”
Silence.
Catherine didn’t speak right away. She didn’t rush to fill the void his words left behind. She just stood there, the weight of his guilt settling between them.
Then, finally—
Her expression softened. &quot;I see.&quot; Her voice was gentle, but there was no pity in it. Just understanding. &quot;That must have been devastating.&quot;
Eddie nodded, his voice low, tinged with regret.
&quot;I felt a guilt I’d never known before.&quot; The words came out hoarse, as if admitting it made the weight heavier. &quot;I couldn’t bear the thought of hurting someone like that again. So when I got my expulsion notice… I shut myself off from Alchemy.&quot;
He exhaled sharply. &quot;I thought if I stayed away, I could protect people. That it was the right thing to do.&quot;
His fists clenched. &quot;But it just made me numb.&quot; His gaze dropped to the ground, lost in the patterns of dirt and shadows. 
Catherine hummed thoughtfully as she tied off the last bandage, her hands moving with practiced ease. She didn’t offer some grand speech or elaborate wisdom, no reassurances that everything would be fine, no lofty words about fate or redemption.
Instead, she simply patted the side of his arm and grinned.
&quot;There we go!&quot; she declared, sitting back with satisfaction. &quot;Good as new. Well—&quot; she eyed his bruised limbs and tattered clothes with a smirk, &quot;—good enough that Torrie won’t burst into tears the second she sees you.&quot;
Eddie blinked. He wasn’t sure what he had been expecting—some profound remark, maybe. Something wise, something complicated. 
But Catherine was just… Catherine.
Jovial, lighthearted, moving forward like the weight of the world never quite stuck to her.
&quot;Now,&quot; she said, pushing herself to her feet and brushing the dirt from her skirt, &quot;Let’s get moving before Torrie and Markus think we actually died.&quot;
Eddie huffed a quiet laugh, shaking his head. The ache in his chest remained, but it felt lighter now—just a little.
With a groan, he braced his hands against the ground and pushed himself up. His legs wobbled beneath him, the weight of exhaustion pressing down, but he steadied himself with a deep breath. His fingers curled around the broken remains of his father’s rifle, using it as a crutch.
Catherine watched him with an arched brow. &quot;You good?&quot;
&quot;Not even remotely,&quot; Eddie muttered, adjusting his grip on the rifle. &quot;But I can walk.&quot;
&quot;Good enough for me.&quot; She flashed a grin and turned toward the forest path.
Eddie inhaled, feeling the crisp night air sting his lungs. His body ached, his thoughts still churned, but he took a step forward.
And then another.
And another.</Text>
            <Notes>What do they want? And why cant they have it?

Eddie wants to defeat the Nightingale Fox, an illusory Shape-shifting creature that dwells in the Illusory forest. But it keeps fading, it changes and it attacks.

Who cares? What happen if they dont get it?

What is the good news?



What is the bad news?

            <Title>Chapter 2E V4</Title>
            <Text>The bus groaned. It clanked beneath the floorboards like a piggy bank, accompanied by the rhythmic squeaking of the old suspension every time they hit a bump.
The seats creaked whenever someone shifted their weight. Somewhere near the back, a bolt was loose—it rattled faintly with every turn.
Overhead, the air conditioner wheezed out cool air in pitiful, uneven bursts. It clicked now and then, like it was trying to restart itself but kept giving up. 
The whole vehicle smelled faintly of dust and dried grass. 
Eddie sat near the window, his crutch propped beside him, fingers loosely gripping the handle. The metal of it was warm to the touch from sitting in the sunlight. His leg ached dully from the vibrations in the floor.
It was a week after his admission to Edenfield Infirmary, the nurses decided to let him go, since he looked more fine than ever, (and with Ashley and Will visiting too often, it gets really rowdy) and so he decided to leave and take his weekend somewhere.
Outside, the usual bustle of Edenfield is starting to give way to open fields. The noise of city life—the chatter of street vendors, the distant clanging of bells, the squeals of tram brakes—had long since faded, replaced by the subtle hum of wind brushing over fields.
He leaned against the cool windowpane and let his eyes drift to the hills outside.
The note crinkled faintly in his hand as he turned it over again.
21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground. Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.
Madeleine’s handwriting was neat, almost too neat—like every letter had been shaped with care.
He could’ve ignored it.
Midterms were over. Will was back to his stacks of books. Ashley had thrown herself into her advocacy group again, fighting for student protections and probably brewing some conspiracy after everything that happened to him.
He could’ve gone back to the Book Pirates, argued about the latest book they’d smuggled in from the restricted section. He’d even drafted a rant about the plot holes in The Alchemist’s Mirror.
And yet, here he was.
Why?
Because of a hunch? Because of that thing that chased him—crawling on all fours with arms too long and a face that didn’t look human?
Or maybe because of her.
He let out a slow breath and leaned his head against the window. The glass was warm.
She’d been patient with him. Even when she caught him that one time—slipping a book from the library.
Who was he kidding?
She was kind to everyone. That was just who she was.
Eddie looked outside again. The golden fields started to thin. In their place, narrow rivers carved winding paths through the land, glinting in the sunlight. Trees—tall, broad, and old—appeared more frequently now, rising from mossy rocks and thick underbrush. Their branches cast flickering shadows that danced across the windows as the bus rattled along the dirt path, it reminds him of home.
The road dipped and groaned under the weight of the vehicle. Somewhere beneath Eddie’s seat, a loose panel clattered like it might fall off. Still, he kept his eyes forward.
The bus finally creaked to a stop before a worn wooden cabin that sat nestled beneath a wide oak tree. A crooked sign swung gently in the breeze above the door.
Norwood Campgrounds.
Eddie looked at the paper again, unfolding it like he hadn’t memorized every inch of it.
21st Norwood Street, past the campground.
Right, this must be it.
With a grunt, he pressed a hand to the metal frame of the seat in front of him and hoisted himself up. His angle protested instantly.
“Stupid… thing,” Eddie cursed at his own leg, “Should’ve waited a few more days.”
The aisle felt narrower than usual. He shuffled past the rows of empty seats, his hand dragging along the backs of them for balance, his body swaying with the uneven ground beneath the bus.
Gravel crunched under his foot. The scent of pine hit him immediately—strong, earthy, and damp. Somewhere nearby, birds were chirping, and the wind whistled gently through the leaves like a whisper.
Eddie took a few slow steps forward, scanning the area. Past the bus stop and Norwood Campgrounds cabin, there wasn’t much—just a scattering of wooden buildings, most of them locked up, a picnic table or two, and a lonely clothesline swaying in the breeze. Beyond that, just trees. Trees and shadows. Tall and thick, the kind that swallowed noise and direction.
He turned the note over in his hand again.
&quot;Past the campground, near the griffin statue.&quot; it said. 
Where? 
There was nothing here but locked-up cabins and trees that swallowed the light. After ten minutes of limping down a trail that led nowhere and getting confused looks from the few campers he saw, irritation began to prickle under his skin. He came to a stop by a large oak, leaning heavily on his crutch. His leg throbbed, his shirt was sticking to his back, and he was starting to feel like an idiot. Maybe this was all just a test. Or worse, a joke.
He came to a slow stop by a large oak tree, breathing hard. His leg was sore, his shirt was sticking to his back, and he was starting to wonder if this had all been a mistake. Maybe Madeleine had been joking. Or testing him. Or maybe—
“Edward!”
The voice cut through the woods like a warm gust of air. He froze, eyes scanning the brush and the winding paths around him.
Again, “Edward!”
He turned just in time to see a figure emerging between two trees—wavy red hair catching the sunlight like a flicker of fire, arms waving above her head.
Madeleine.
She jogged toward him, boots thudding softly against the dirt path, a wide smile on her face.
“You made it!” she called, beaming.
Before he could respond, she closed the distance and moved to wrap her arms around him. She caught herself halfway, her eyes darting to his crutch and the way he held his body stiffly. Her wide smile softened into a look of immediate concern. 
“Agh—crap—my leg!” Eddie winced, half-laughing, half-wheezing.
Madeleine immediately pulled back, her eyes wide. “Oh no! I’m so sorry—I didn’t know you were still healing!” 
He waved it off, trying to catch his breath. “No, no, it’s fine—just… a bit too soon for a bear hug, y’know?”
Madeleine frowned, looking genuinely guilty. “You really should’ve waited a few more days. You didn't have to come all this way. You didn’t sneak out of your dorm, right?” 
“What can I say,” Eddie shrugged. “Couldn’t pass up a chance to meet the fire-breathing, death-dealing dragons you’ve kept here.”
He expected a laugh, but Madeleine just nodded thoughtfully toward the distant trees. “You’ll have to wait on the dragons, I’m afraid. The matriarch has a wing injury and we’re keeping the hatchling in the containment ward for observation.”
“Haha, yeah.” Eddie chuckled. Then paused. “Wait… you’re serious?”

-o-

The path they followed are narrow. Between rows upon rows of towering pine trees and giant rocks. The sunlight filtering through in golden slants. The silence of the woods was complete—except for the occasional chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves, and now and then, a distant, eerie wail from deeper in the forest.
“So…” Eddie opened, beginning to feel the silence, “How long have you been doing this? The Sanctuary thing.”
“Since my first year.” Her voice was calm, nostalgic. “I signed up as a volunteer the moment I arrived in Edenfield. But to be honest, it started long before that.”
“You grew up around these kind of stuff?”
“You could say that,” she said with a small laugh. “But not exactly, I was always obsessed with them. Reading about them. Drawing them. Pretending I had one hidden under my bed when I was little.” She slowed her pace a little, eyes scanning the path ahead. 
“There was one time,” She continued, “When I was maybe eight or nine—me and two of my best friends were playing by the creek near my place. We stumbled on this injured hatchling. Tiny thing. Could barely stand. It must’ve gotten separated from its flock.”
Eddie listened, the rhythmic thud of his crutch tapping the dirt between her words.
“We couldn’t tell our parents,” she continued. “They’d have made us give it up right away. Said it was too dangerous. So we took turns sneaking out food and blankets. One of us would always be on watch while the others fed it and tend to its wing.”
“It took almost a year.” She smiled, “But one day, it just stood up, flapped its wings, and took off. Just like that. No warning. No goodbye. He’s Just… gone.”
“Didn’t that… I don’t know… Hurt?” Eddie asked.
“What do you mean?” Madeleine asked back.
“I don’t know…” Eddie said, “Taking care of something for almost a year. You must’ve grown attached to that thing, you know?”
Madeleine shook her head. “Some people say letting go is painful. But I didn’t feel that way. It’s just that the feeling I felt finally seeing them fly again outweights the feeling I felt when they left. Seeing it soar… If felt as if we did something good, and that was enough.”
They walked in silence for a few more steps.
Eddie looked at her. “That’s a lot of heart for an eight-year-old.”
“I don’t think it was heart.” Madeleine smiled at him. “It was hope.”

-o-

They walked for some time, the path narrowing until it became little more than a trail of flattened leaves and twisted roots. Eventually, Madeleine veered off the track, motioning for Eddie to follow her. He hesitated for a moment, then sighed and limped after her into a quiet clearing surrounded by towering trees.
At the far end of the clearing stood two trees unlike any Eddie had seen before. They were impossibly tall, ancient, their gnarled trunks wide enough to fit a whole bus between them. Roots like thick ropes coiled at their bases, and their dark green canopies loomed high above the rest of the forest like silent sentinels.
Eddie stood in the middle of the clearing, taking in the sheer scale of them.
Madeleine, meanwhile, walked toward the space between the trees. She paced to and fro in front of them, scanning the area.
“What are you doing?” Eddie called.
Madeleine squinted at the ground, then up at the trunks. “Someone must’ve closed the gate.”
“The what?”
“Did you bring a wand?”
“I umm… no, I don’t have any.”
She winced. “Right. Of course, sorry I forgot you’re in Alchemy. I don’t have mine either.”
With a resigned sigh, Madeleine stepped up to one of the trees and began patting the bark, feeling around the grooves like someone searching for a hidden latch. After a few moments, she let out a soft “Ah-ha!” and pulled something free from a hollow in the bark.
It was a staff—twisted wood woven into a lattice, with a simple, clouded crystal embedded at the top. The whole thing looked as if it had grown that way.
Madeleine approached the first tree and tapped it once with the staff. Then she crossed over to the other and did the same.
Finally, she returned to Eddie’s side, held the staff upright, and brought its base down against the earth with a soft thunk.
At first, nothing happened.
Then, high above, something stirred.
Eddie looked up just in time to see a thick branch from one tree curl inward like a bending arm. The other tree responded in kind. The two branches reached across the empty space between them and interlocked, forming a curved archway of living wood.
And beneath that arch, the world changed.
Where moments ago there had only been trees and brambles, now stood an open expanse of green fields stretching gently toward the horizon. A wooden fence traced the edge of a nearby pasture, and beyond it were low cabins with mossy roofs, a few smoke trails curling lazily from chimneys. The scent of hay and something vaguely sulfurous wafted from the invisible threshold.
Eddie blinked. “That’s… new.”
Madeleine grinned. “Welcome to the Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.”

            <Title>Chapter 6E_V4</Title>
            <Text>The streets of Aetherell Reach blurred past him, gaslamps flickering like dying stars as he pushed himself forward, lungs burning, slippers slapping against stone. The chill of the northern district clawed at his skin—through his thin t-shirt, through his worn jacket—as if the night itself wanted to slow him down.
But he didn’t stop.
His breath came in ragged bursts, each one sharp in his throat. The frost-bitten wind stung his eyes, numbed his fingers, howled past his ears like a warning—but still, he ran.
He’d outrun the Student Council back at the quad, their shouts falling behind him, swallowed by the dark. He didn’t look back. Couldn’t bear the thought of losing time. Every second pounded louder than his footsteps.
Please be alright.
Aetherell Reach was quieter than usual. Windows shuttered. Market stalls empty. Only the occasional flutter of paper in the gutter or the creak of a distant weathervane marked the silence.
He turned a corner too fast, nearly lost his footing on a slick patch of cobble, caught himself on a lamppost, and kept moving. His legs screamed, but his mind screamed louder.
Madeleine’s voice echoed in his memory—panicked, cut short. That sound at the end. The static. Her breath catching.
Something was wrong. Deeply wrong.
The familiar row of apartments came into view up ahead, their rooftops hunched against the dark. Madeleine’s place was just beyond the iron arch with the ivy-covered wall, the one she’d once pointed out to him with a quiet smile and a joke about noisy upstairs neighbors.
He passed beneath it now, breath ragged, eyes scanning every shadow, every doorway.
And then he saw it.
The phone booth.
The door hung ajar. One panel of glass shattered at the base. The receiver swayed gently on its cord like a pendulum, clinking softly against the frame.
Eddie slowed, chest heaving, heart somewhere in his throat.
“Madeleine?” he called out, voice hoarse. “Madeleine!”
No answer. Just the rustle of the ivy. The night.
A dim glow pulsed from the jade ring on his right hand. Soft green lines curled outward from the gem, forming a faint, floating transmutation circle that hovered just above his knuckles.
He inched forward.
Eddie’s eyes flicked to the windows above. Empty. Dark. Watching.
His fingers twitched at his sides. With each step, the weight in his chest grew heavier, the air colder. The transmutation circle sparked faintly as his boot brushed over broken glass.
He reached the booth.
Paused.
Looked inside.
And opened the door.
It creaked—slow, deliberate, far too loud. He winced at the sound, then froze.
Nothing.
No sign of a struggle. No blood. 
Only a single object lay on the ground.
Her wand.
Abandoned. Resting in a small patch of frost just beneath the shattered glass, its wood chipped at the grip, still faintly warm with her magic.
Eddie stared.
The chill that ran through him now had nothing to do with the wind.
He crouched slowly, picked up the wand, cradled it in both hands.
His heart hammered in his ears. His mind screamed to reject the sight.
She wouldn’t have left this behind.
One of hers.
Eddie dropped to his knees beside it, heart in freefall.
The wand trembled in his hands. He was so lost in the cold, hollow space that had opened up inside him that he didn't hear the footsteps approaching until they stopped right behind him.
“Well, well. Cornered at last.”
The voice was sharp, cold, and laced with victory. Eddie didn’t have to look up to know it was Victoria Aynesworth. He could feel the smug authority radiating from her.
“It’s over, Welton,” she said, her voice devoid of any sympathy for the scene she’d just walked into. “Go back to your dorm now, and this will end with a simple suspension. Continue to be a problem, and I will personally deliver your expulsion papers to the Dean’s office tomorrow.”
Eddie didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just knelt there, staring at the wand, the world outside muted by the roaring in his ears.
Victoria’s patience snapped. “Did you hear me?” she repeated, her voice louder now. When he still didn’t respond, she made a sharp, decisive sound of disgust.
“Stun him,” she ordered her two guards with cold finality. “We can carry him back to his dorm. I’ll make the report tomorrow so he can pack his things.”
One of the bulky Student Council members nodded and began to reach for the wand tucked into his belt.
But just as his fingers closed around the handle, a sudden movement in a dark alleyway to their left caught Victoria’s eye. She spun around, her expression sharp with alarm.
“Who goes there?!”
Before anyone could answer, a bright blue transmutation circle flared to life in the alley's mouth, bathing the street in an ethereal glow. A split second later, a powerful shockwave erupted from it, not with a bang, but with a deep, resonant thump that seemed to compress the very air.
Victoria and her two guards were thrown backward off their feet, yelps of surprise cut short as they sailed through the air. But they didn’t hit the ground. From the cracks between the cobblestones, thick, leafy vines erupted with impossible speed, weaving into a living net that caught them, then wrapped around their limbs, holding them suspended and unconscious a foot above the ground.
The sudden blast of magic shook Eddie from his stupor. He looked up, his eyes wide with confusion, searching the shadows for the source of the attack. Who else was here?
And then, a familiar, exasperated voice drifted from the alley.
“Really?” it said. “A shockwave? Were you trying to stun them or kill them?”
“Look, that’s why I asked you to conjure the vines, alright?” another familiar voice shot back, defensive. “See? They’re fine!” The figure of Will stepped out of the alley, followed closely by Ashley. 
Will’s gaze immediately found Eddie, his bravado melting away into pure concern. “It doesn’t matter now. Eddie!” he said, rushing to his side. “Are you alright?”
Will’s question hung in the air, but Eddie barely heard it. His gaze was fixed on the empty phone booth, on the space where Madeleine had been. The reality of it crashed over him in a sickening wave.
“M-Madeleine,” he stammered, his voice cracking as he scrambled to his feet. “They’ve got Madeleine!” The words tore from his throat, culminating in a raw, guttural scream of pure anguish that echoed in the cold, empty street.
“H-hey, I know, I know,” Will said, grabbing Eddie’s arm to steady him as he swayed. Ashley moved to his other side, her presence a silent support. “We’ll get you back to the dorm, okay? We’ll figure it out there.”
“No!” Eddie thrashed, trying to pull away. His eyes were wild. “I need to find her! Now!”
“Look, I know, but you can’t just go running out there, it’s—” Will started, struggling to hold him back.
“Let go of me!” Eddie bellowed, shoving at him with all his strength.
“Listen to me!”
Will’s roar was so sudden, so uncharacteristically loud and forceful, that it shocked Eddie into stillness. He froze, breathing heavily, staring at his friend. He had never heard Will shout before. Ever.
Will’s chest was heaving, his own fear and frustration finally boiling over. 
“I get it,” he said, his voice still shaking but firm now. “Something is terribly wrong, and you want to right that wrong. But you cannot do it alone! Not anymore!” He looked Eddie dead in the eyes. “You need to realize what you’re up against.”
His expression softened, the anger draining away, leaving only a deep, pleading concern. “You just need to let us help you, Eddie.”
The fight went out of Eddie all at once. He sank back to his knees, the adrenaline replaced by a crushing wave of despair. He looked down at the wand in his hands.
“It’s over,” he whispered, his voice hollow. 
“There’s nothing we can do. They have her now.” His breath hitched, and the guilt he’d been holding back poured out. 
“It’s my fault. I dragged her into this. I went to the Sanctuary…  I should have just stayed back in the dorm like you said.” He finally looked at Will, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “It’s over, Will. There’s nothing we can do.”
Nobody spoke. The only sound was the wind rustling the ivy on the nearby wall. Eddie stared at him, confused, hanging on to his words.
Will leaned in closer, his voice dropping but gaining an intensity that felt ancient and wise.
“It is not over, when you deem it is not over.”
The world stopped. The words struck Eddie with the force of a physical blow, an echo from a past he thought he’d left behind. He stared at Will, bewildered. He had heard that phrase before, long, long ago, in another lifetime it seemed.
Will saw the flicker of recognition in his friend’s eyes and pressed on, his voice earnest. “You might feel hopeless right now, Eddie, but it’s far from over.” He gestured around them, at the night, at his friends. “You still have us. You still have time. You still have the information you risked everything for tonight. It is far, far from over. You just need to believe in yourself again.”
“And in us.” Ashley added, smiling at him.
Will looked at her, and then stood up, brushing the dust from his knees. He looked down at Eddie and offered his hand.
“Come on,” he said, a hint of his usual pragmatic urgency returning. “Let’s get going before anyone sees us stunning the head of the Student Council.”
Eddie sat there on the cold ground, looking from Will’s outstretched hand to Ashley’s steady face beside him. She gave him a small, encouraging nod. He was right. He couldn’t do it alone. He shouldn’t have to.
And those words… Catherine’s words. Even after a year, after everything that had happened, her teachings had found him here, at his lowest point, spoken by his best friend. The sheer, absurd irony of it all bubbled up inside him, and he let out a short, choked laugh. It was a morbid sound in the heavy silence, but it was a laugh nonetheless.
“Damn you, Catherine,” Eddie whispered to himself, a wry, bittersweet smile touching his lips. He looked up at Will. “You never leave me alone, huh.”
He grabbed his friend’s hand, and Will pulled him firmly to his feet.
Eddie stood, taking a deep breath, the crushing weight on his chest feeling just a little lighter. He looked at his friends, truly a part of their team again.
“Let’s go,” Will said, and they turned as one, breaking into a run back toward the safety of their dorm.
They ran in sync for a few paces before Ashley’s voice, full of genuine curiosity, cut through the rhythmic sound of their footsteps, “Hey, who’s Catherine?”
Eddie glanced over at her, the fond, mysterious smile returning to his face. “Eh,” he said, his voice light for the first time all night. “Nobody you should know about.”
“Hey, come on!” Ashley protested, jogging to keep up. “Why is everyone keeping secrets now?”

Eddie arrives in Edenfield, orientation 

CODEX SUBPLOT
Eddie met with the two scholars named Aenid and Hadir, they recognised him from Weshaven, and talked about the codex they got from Catherine. One of them argues that it might be Necromancy, but the other argues otherwise, 	The scholars argues that no form of Magical Branch can seemingly do the technique described in the Codex, either they needed a Spellcraftsman to construct a new spell system to cast the spell described in the Codex, or else, they needed someone that can perform and understood Ancient Magic, which is debatable, since nobody would be alive today to know such a thing, not even Master Katarina

At the end, Eddie is going to steal the codex to learn the magic of Animation, that is breathing life or an illusion of life into something. But the magic of Animation is either taboo or forbidden, and it is said that the technique lies in the Codex Chilandar, the one codex kept secret by the Two Scholars


PRINCE SUBPLOT
Eddie felt a strange affiction to visiting the Palace of Edenfield

Throne room scene

At the end, he will piece two and two together, and discovers he can do Old Magic



The Theme of ACT 1 should be Belonging, Eddie didn’t belong in Aella, in Aella there is always a sense that Eddie has a different source of magic.</Text>

            <Text>“Crazy?” Catherine asked back, clearly unimpressed by his tone, &quot;Do I look crazy to you?&quot; 
&quot;Yes! You are!” Eddie groaned, running a hand through his hair. “You’re talking about stepping off the path in this forest. You know what they say about people who wander off.&quot; He gestured toward the surrounding trees, their towering forms like silent sentinels. &quot;They don’t come back, Catherine.&quot;
Her expression hardened, but there was a flicker of something beneath it—determination, maybe desperation. &quot;I didn’t come all this way to turn back now,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;That artifact is out there, Eddie. The ruins aren’t far, and I won’t lose my chance to find it.&quot;
Eddie glanced back toward Markus and Torrie, who were blissfully unaware of the conversation. The Eden Flowers cast their golden glow, serene and otherworldly, as if mocking the storm brewing in his chest.
&quot;You’re seriously going to risk it?&quot; he asked, his voice quieter now, tinged with disbelief.
Catherine folded the map, tucking it into her coat’s pocket. &quot;I am,&quot; she said simply. &quot;You can stay here if you want. I understand if you’re too afraid to come with me.&quot;
Her words stung, and Eddie clenched his jaw. He didn’t want to admit that the thought of leaving the safety of the path terrified him, but the idea of letting her wander into danger alone was somehow worse.
Before Eddie could say anything, Markus, who had been watching the exchange from a distance, stood up. His movements were slow, deliberate, as he dusted off his hands and adjusted the satchel of ingredients he’d been collecting.
&quot;I’ll go with her,&quot; Markus said, his voice calm but resolute.
Both Eddie and Catherine turned to him in surprise.
&quot;What?&quot; Eddie asked, blinking.
Markus shrugged, stepping closer. &quot;You clearly don’t want to go, and I get it. This place gives me the creeps too. But I’m not about to let Catherine go out there alone. Someone’s got to watch her back.&quot; 
Eddie hesitated, his heart twisting. He didn’t want Markus going out there either—his best friend venturing into the dangers beyond the path felt just as reckless.
&quot;You don’t even know what’s out there,&quot; Eddie argued, his voice more desperate than he intended.
Markus smirked. &quot;Neither do you. That’s kind of the point, isn’t it? But someone’s got to keep her out of trouble, and we both know I’m a better shot than you anyway.&quot;
&quot;Really? You’re bringing that out now?” Eddie’s eyes narrowed.  “You’ve only been practicing on bottles in the backyard for, what, a month?&quot;
Markus shrugged, his grin turning impish. &quot;Still a better track record than you. How many Streamwyrms have you missed back home? Six? Seven?&quot;
&quot;Three,&quot; Eddie shot back defensively.
&quot;Sure,&quot; Markus said with exaggerated disbelief.
Despite the tension in his chest, Eddie found himself chuckling. The absurdity of Markus’s humor had a way of cutting through even the most heated moments. Catherine, standing a few steps away, folded her arms and raised an eyebrow at the exchange, a faint hint of impatience flickering across her face.
Markus extended a hand toward Eddie. &quot;Come on, Ed. Hand it over. If I’m going into uncharted ruins with her, I’m going armed.&quot;
Eddie hesitated, the weight of his flintlock rifle suddenly feeling heavier. His instincts told him to hold onto it, but Markus’s unwavering gaze—and the quiet determination behind his easygoing demeanor—made him pause.
Reluctantly, Eddie handed the rifle over, along with the satchel of metal balls and gunpowder. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with resignation. &quot;Just… don’t waste all the ammo trying to hit trees, alright?&quot;
“Don’t worry, Edward. I will not miss.” Markus took the rifle with a small, triumphant smile, slinging the satchel over his shoulder. &quot;In fact, our next batch of potions shall have dragon scales in them.&quot;
Eddie chuckled, then watched as Markus turned to Catherine, who nodded her thanks. The two exchanged a brief glance of understanding, and then, without another word, they stepped off the safety of the Traveler’s Path.
The golden glow of the Eden Flowers illuminated their retreating figures for only a few paces before the dense forest swallowed them. The faint crunch of their boots against the underbrush grew quieter, until it was lost entirely to the eerie silence of the Heart of the Deep Glaive.
Eddie stood motionless, his hands now empty, the weight of what had just happened settling over him like a heavy cloak. Torrie, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, was still playing with her flower crown a few paces away.
For a long moment, Eddie stared after them, a deep unease gnawing at his stomach.
What if they don’t come back?
He shook the thought away, but it lingered at the edges of his mind like a shadow.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1E V7</Title>
            <Text>A distant hum, soft and steady. Rhythmic clicking on tile. Muffled voices tangled just beyond his grasp. Low drawl, a gentle cadence, a sharp interjection. Silk rustled. Glass clinked against a tray. The air was cool on his skin. Eddie’s eyes blinked open. He was in a vibrant ward he didn’t recognize, bathed in the warm, yellow light of stained-glass panels overhead. 
His body felt heavy, like he was sinking into the plush mattress beneath him. He shifted slightly—and a sharp bolt of pain shot up his left leg. He hissed through his teeth and stilled, his breath catching. A dull, throbbing ache pulsed just above the knee. The leg was stiff, wrapped in layers of linen and propped up slightly under the blankets. He could smell the faint, herbal scent of salves clinging to the cloth. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose hospital robe. 
He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the attack.
Voices filtered through the silk curtain beside him.
“…Come on, I’m just saying, there’s no freakin’ way it was some wasted dude with a pitchfork,” came Ashley’s voice, “He was, like, ten minutes from the East Gate. No way some random stumbles that close to campus without getting flagged.”
A deeper voice joined in—measured, steady. “When I found him,” said Henry, “There was someone nearby. Or something that looked like someone.” A short pause, and then, firmer: “But it wasn’t an actual person. Not really. Something about the way it moved... it wasn’t right.” 
Ashley then turned to Madeleine, “Madeleine, you’re the creature nerd here—what do you think? Something’s off, right?” 
“I’m not sure,” said Madeleine gently. “The shape of the wounds—it's not consistent with a  pitchfork. They’re jagged, uneven… it’s like when your cat scratch you, but worse.”
Ashley let out a dry laugh. “Okay, well, that must’ve been one seriously pissed-off cat to make that wound.” 
“Hang on a minute,” Will said, voice low and serious, leaning forward like he was letting them in on something. “You reckon it was a creature? That’d track. I mean—think about it. If it was, the police’d have to log it, send word to the Council, all that red tape. But they didn’t. They buried it. I think they don’t want folks panicking. Wouldn’t be the first time they swept something under the rug—what with all those curfew notices and whispers about things prowling after dark.”
Ashley snorted. “Here we go—Detective Will’s back on the case. Next thing you know, you’ll be drawing red strings in your dorm room.”
“I’m just saying,” Will continued, “We’ve been here long enough. And we know the police don’t spin that hard unless someone told ’em to. Higher up.”
There was a pause. Eddie kept his breathing steady, not quite ready to let them know he was awake.
“I saw it with my own eyes,” Henry said, his voice low and steady. “It looked like a man. Walked like one too. But something was off—uncanny. That’s not an animal attack. Whatever it was... it wasn’t just some beast.” 
Another pause.
“But you really think they’d put that in the official report?” Will said, brows furrowed. “They’ve been brushing this under for months. First it’s missing pets—brushed off as strays. Then the whispers about Red Oak Lane, alleys folk avoid after sundown. Come on. Anyone with half a brain can see something’s not right.” 
“—And now Edward.” Madeleine’s voice softened. “He could’ve died.”
Eddie blinked slowly, then let out a low groan. The talking stopped instantly.
“He’s awake,” Madeleine said gently, and he heard the shift of feet as someone moved to his bedside.
The curtain drew back, and light spilled across his bed. Madeleine stood closest, her auburn hair catching the light. Ashley gave him a lopsided grin from beside her, while Will crossed her arms and gave him a look that was half-relief, half-scolding.
“Eddie!” Ashley said, shaking her head with a grin, “Dude, you gotta stop getting yourself wrecked if you wanna survive first year. Like, seriously.” 
“I—I didn’t…” Eddie’s voice cracked. He coughed. His throat felt raw. “What happened?”
“We were rather hoping you’d be the one to fill us in,” Will said, his brow slightly knit. 
“Henry told us that you were found unconscious outside the Astral Garden, unconscious,” Madeleine explained, voice soothing. “Your wounds were… severe. They said it was a pitchfork, but—”
“—But like, no random dude’s just strollin’ around Edenfield with a pitchfork like it’s Halloween or something,” Ashley cut in. 
Eddie pushed himself upright, ignoring the sharp protest from his side. “No,” he said, his voice raspy but firm. “It wasn’t a drunk. It wasn’t a pitchfork.” He looked from Will to Ashley. “Whatever the official report says, it’s a lie. I don’t know what it was, but I know it wasn’t that.”
Will stepped forward, his tone steady but earnest. “Eddie, you can trust us, mate. Whatever you remember—just say it. We’re not about to go blabbing it around.” 
She glanced at the others—Madeleine, Will, even Henry—waiting for their confirmation. One by one, they nodded.
Eddie hesitated. The memory a blur in his mind, sharp and confusing. But one detail glared, undeniable.
“I could’ve sworn it was a person,” he said slowly. “Not an animal I saw them, just for a second. A silhouette. Tall. Human. Moving weird, but definitely a person.”
The words had barely left his mouth when Madeleine stiffened.
“A person?” she repeated, her voice a pitch higher than usual. “You’re sure? Not an animal?”
Eddie frowned at her reaction. Madeleine, normally so composed—always the calm in any storm—suddenly looked pale. Her fingers clutched the hem of her sleeve.
“I mean—yeah,” he said, uncertain. “It looked like one. Didn’t see a face or anything.”
“Did it use something to hurt you?”
Eddie let out a breath, then leaned back against the pillows, eyes distant. “I didn’t think much of it at first,” he said, voice low. “It was almost two in the morning. I’d just left the library—I’d stayed late copying a book for Alchemy. The campus was dead quiet.”
&quot;I was walking past the East Gate,&quot; Eddie continued, his eyes unfocused as he replayed the scene. &quot;And I saw someone just… standing there. That was the first thing that was off. He was wearing a full suit, standing perfectly still under a gaslamp. Who does that at two in the morning?&quot; 
Will frowned. “A suit?”
Eddie nodded. “Dark-colored. Didn’t look like a student. Or a professor. Just this tall guy. I thought maybe he was lost. Or drunk. I kept walking.”
His voice dropped. “Then I heard footsteps. Behind me. Slow. Limping.”
A hush fell over the group.
“I turned onto Fallow Lane—the one behind the Rune Studies hall,” he said. “And that’s when I saw it again. It was following me. Limping like its leg was twisted or broken. That’s when I started running.”
Madeleine’s hand covered her mouth.
“I didn’t look back until I crossed into the courtyard behind Alchemy Hall. I thought I’d lost it. But when I turned…” Eddie swallowed. “It wasn’t standing anymore.”
He looked up at them. “It was walking on all fours. Like—like a dog. Except it was still wearing the suit. Its arms were too long. And its face…” He blinked, the memory flickering behind his eyes. “Its face wasn’t right. The eyes were too far apart. The skin looked stretched. Like it was trying to look human, but couldn’t quite manage it.”
Silence.
Just stunned stillness.
Eddie looked between them, the weight of the memory clinging to his chest. “Any idea what that might be?”
For a moment, no one moved.
Then Will leaned forward, brows furrowed. “Could it be a Ghoul? Or, like… some kind of Undead?”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Henry sighed. “Ghouls don’t wander into cities. They stick to old battlefields or ancient ruins. There hasn’t been a proper Undead sighting in Solivia for centuries.”
Ashley rested her chin in her hand. “Well, what about vampires? Or, ooh—maybe a werewolf. Full moon’s just around the corner.”
“Ash, come on. There’s no vamps or werewolves in Edenfield. If there were, the Ministry would’ve locked the city down yesterday.”
Madeleine opened her mouth slightly, but hesitated—her brows pinched, clearly thinking.
Henry noticed. “Madeleine,” he said gently, “You’ve got something, don’t you?”
She glanced at Eddie, then back to the others. “Maybe,” she murmured. “I… I don’t know for sure, but…” Her voice dropped. “What Eddie described… the way it moved, how it looked almost human before it—shifted…”
“…It sounded like the behaviour of a Chimaera.”
The word lingered.
Silence fell. Will rubbed the back of his neck, eyes narrowed in thought. Henry crossed his arms, staring at the floor as if trying to piece together something unspoken.
“Whoa wait,” Ashley broke the quiet. “Hold up. What even is a Chimaera?”
Madeleine’s expression turned grave. “It’s not just one thing,” she said softly. “Chimaera is a classification. They’re creatures made through unnatural means. Most of them through a technique called Alchemical Grafting.”
Ashley blinked. “Grafting, like plants?”
“Kind of,” Madeleine said, her tone tight. “But instead of branches and vines, you’re stitching together flesh. Tendons. Bones. Sometimes even minds. It’s a practice skirting the edge of necromancy—closer to that than real alchemy.”
Henry’s brow furrowed. “And you're sure that's what this was?”
Madeleine hesitated for a moment, then took a slow breath, like she was bracing herself.
“Last semester, the Sanctuary received a creature,” she said, her voice lower now, almost like she was telling a ghost story around a fire. “It was found by a Paladin unit stationed just outside the city walls. Whatever it was, it was barely alive. Mangled. Scarred. And… wrong. Its body didn’t match any known species—nothing from the Catalogue of Mythical Creatures. Nothing from the Sanctuary’s archives. It had human teeth. Reptilian skin. Its lungs… clicked when it breathed.”
“Ew…” Ashley shivered. “Gross.”
“The researchers tried everything. Scans. Genetic matching. Even magical tracing,” Madeleine continued, her voice hushed. “But it didn’t belong to anything in our world. Eventually, they gave up. The only category that fit was Chimaera—a man-made thing, spliced from gods-know-what.”
Will leaned forward. “What happened to it?”
“It died,” she said, simply. “Didn’t survive a month. Screamed the entire last night it was alive. Then just… stopped.”
No one spoke.
The air in the infirmary had gone still again.
Madeleine finally turned to Henry, her voice more measured now. “I’m not saying I’m a hundred percent sure. But from what I saw… from what I tried to nurse last semester…” She paused, searching for the right words. “It really sounded like a Chimaera. The way it moved. The way Eddie described its body—those inconsistencies.” She shook her head slightly. “It’s only my theory. That’s all.”
Henry didn’t respond at first. His jaw tightened, and his eyes dropped to the floor as if something was beginning to click into place. Slowly, deliberately, he looked back up at her.
“…If that’s true,” he said, his voice low, like he didn’t want the words to be real, “then that means…”
“Someone succeeded in creating it,” Madeleine said quietly. “And if what Eddie saw was true…” Her gaze slid toward Eddie, then returned to Henry. “…Then not just once. But twice.”
But Madeleine wasn’t smiling.
“We got to do something about this,” Eddie said, his voice raspy but firm.
“Eddie…” Will started, his tone a clear warning, as if he knew exactly where this was heading.
“What?” Eddie pushed on, his gaze sweeping over them. “Don’t you see? If what Madeleine’s saying is true, then we have to do something. One of these… Chimaeras… maybe that’s a coincidence. A single, twisted experiment that got loose. But two of them? That’s not random. That’s a pattern. Something bigger is happening.”
Henry let out a short, harsh breath. “And what do you suggest we do, Edward? March down to the Edenfield Police Department and tell them we saw a Frankenstein monster in a business suit attacking people? Forget it,” he said, shaking his head. “You’ve got more luck telling them aliens exist.”
“So we do nothing?” Eddie shot back, pushing himself up further against the pillows, wincing as his side flared in protest. “We just sit here and wait? What happens when it attacks someone else? And they aren’t as lucky as I was?”
“Eddie, stop!” Will interjected, his voice suddenly sharp with anger. “You can’t do any more of your sneaking around! You’ve already been caught in the library after hours. The Student Council is onto you. You have one more strike, one more warning before you’re expelled! In your first year!”
Eddie’s argument died in his throat. He looked around the room, seeing the conflict on their faces now solidifying into a shared, reluctant agreement. He looked at Ashley, hoping for an ally, for her usual bravado to side with him. She just chewed on her lip, avoiding his eyes.
“I’m sorry, Ed,” Ashley finally said, her voice quiet. “But I think Will’s right. This is too dangerous.”
Before anyone could respond, the curtain snapped open with a rustle of silk.
A nurse in pale blue robes stepped in, smiling politely. “Sorry to interrupt. Visiting hours for Mr. Welton are over. The doctor will be in shortly for his examination.”
The group broke from their huddle. Ashley stood first, flashing Eddie a crooked smile as she bumped his shoulder lightly. “Alright, dude. Rest up, yeah? And maybe next time, don’t go picking fights with nightmare fuel without giving us a heads-up.” 
Will followed, his tone brisk but warm. “Keep your head clear, Ed. Rest, but don’t forget what happened.”
Henry gave a brief nod, the hem of his coat brushing the polished floor. “Stay sharp, Edward. You’re lucky to be alive.”
Then came Madeleine. She stood near the foot of his bed, her expression softer now, though something lingered behind her eyes—concern, perhaps, or fear she wasn’t voicing.
As the others stepped out, she lingered.
“Hey,” she said, her voice quieter now that it was just the two of them. “Do you know when you’ll be out?”
Eddie shook his head. “Dunno. They said at least a week. Maybe two, if the burns need more time.”
Madeleine nodded slowly. Her fingers fidgeted with the sleeve of her robe.
She stepped closer and offered her hand again. He took it—and this time, she held it for a moment longer.
“Good luck,” she said. “And… stay safe, alright?”
Then she flashed him her familiar warm smile. The one that always seemed to smooth the edges of everything else. “When you’re out—come find me. There’s something I want to show you.”
With that, she waved gently and slipped through the curtain after the others.
Eddie leaned back against the pillows, the room quiet again save for the distant hum of magic.
It was only then that he noticed the slip of paper in his hand.
Neat handwriting curled across the page: Madeleine D. 0712 443 229
And beneath it, a simple line:
21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground. 
Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.

            <Notes>Eddie then described the &quot;Man&quot; or what he thought looked like a man, it was in suits, it was 2AM when he went out to go back to his dorm, the man was just standing still, when Eddie walked, and it began to follow him, the way it walked was limping, and as Eddie began to feel that he was being

            <Title>Chapter 33 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie sat back in his chair. Fingers flexing in frustration, the Lead on his desk still staring back at him like some cruel joke. The pressure was beginning to take its toll. The weight started to settle in his chest as he racked his brain. Trying desperately to pull anything from his memories that might help him. His mind flickered between the different phases of his life. His childhood in Weshaven, the long hours spent working with his father in the apothecary, the few years he’d spent at Aella Academy before his expulsion—but nothing seemed to connect.
The faces of his classmates from the academy blurred into one indistinct mass. The late-night lessons with Catherine, like a forgotten dream. He couldn’t recall a single instance when he had been taught to turn lead into Gold—because that had never been something to learn.
Then, the memory of Catherine’s gruff, determined voice cut through the fog. The long hours spent in her company. Her relentless drive to push him to his limits. To teach him not only alchemy, but to question everything he thought he knew. The way she drilled into him the concept that Alchemy wasn’t about following orders or repeating ancient rituals.
“Alchemy is about turning something ordinary into extraordinary,” Catherine had said. “From meaninglessness to something with meaning. From Lead to Gold.”
Eddie winced at the words. Her meaning was clear, but it felt impossible to apply to the task. He shook his head, pressing his palms against his eyes in frustration. He was stuck, hopelessly caught between wanting to respect her teachings and the glaring, irrefutable fact that this—the task before him—was a concept too grand to even fathom.
“Fuck it,” Eddie muttered aloud, the words slipping out of him in exasperation. “This is meaningless anyway.”
For a moment, he just stared at the Lead. The harsh, dull metal that mocked him. Lead to Gold—it was a mantra, an ideal. But what if it was nothing more than a meaningless, unattainable dream? Wasn’t alchemy about transformation? About change? And yet, here he was, caught in the impossible.
Then, with a sudden snap, the idea hit him. A thought so simple it felt almost like a revelation. What if I don’t have to make Lead into Gold? What if he could prove it instead of trying to achieve the impossible? What if he could write down why this task was impossible?
He slammed his palms down on the desk, forcing the tools and papers to shake with force. The decision had been made. Eddie wasn’t going to try and turn the Lead into Gold. No. He wasn’t crazy. He wasn’t going to throw himself into a futile task. Instead, he would write. He would prove to everyone in this room, to every idealistic bastard watching, that it could never be done.
Eddie grabbed the nearest parchment and a quill. The nib trembling in his hand as he started to write. The words poured out of him. Not with the desperation of someone trying to make an impossible thing happen. But with the clear, focused conviction of someone standing firm against a lie.
He would show them in excruciating detail. The reasons why turning Lead into Gold was impossible. He would go through the codices he had studied. Citing the scrolls, Catherine forced him to read and write down every bit of alchemical knowledge that made the task unachievable.
Eddie felt his breath steady for the first time since this challenge had started. A glimmer of resolve ignited within him. He wasn’t crazy. He wasn’t some naïve kid who had misunderstood what alchemy was. No. Alchemy was about meaning. It was about purpose. And this task—the one he had been handed—was the perfect opportunity to show that even in a world of magic and science, some things were just beyond reach.
Eddie’s fingers gripped the quill harder. The ink flowed smoothly as he began to scribble down his theory. What if Lead could be turned into Gold? He would tear down the myth, lay bare the truth, and prove to everyone—especially Emma Somers—that some things can’t be done.
“Let’s see how they like the truth,” Eddie muttered as he continued writing.
o-
The sky outside the testing hall had shifted. Its colours now blend orange and purple, casting a warm, ethereal glow over the room. The flickering light reflected off the polished surfaces of the desks and tools. Marking the passing of time. The scent of ink and parchment still lingered in the air. But the mood had shifted, becoming tense as the last moments of the test came to a close.
The announcer’s voice boomed, clear and commanding, shattering the silence. “Time is up! All candidates are to submit the result of their task to the examiner in the next room!”
A chorus of grumbling rose from the candidates. Some of them sigh in defeat, others shaking their heads in frustration. The task had been more gruelling than they expected. For many, the impossible challenge had left them with little to show for it.
Slowly, the candidates began to stand. Their movements are heavy with the weight of their failure. Some, like the older alchemist near Eddie’s desk, carried their results, but not with pride. The Gold he held in his hands was impure, a mockery of the golden perfection they were supposed to achieve. It looked like Gold from a distance, but the imperfections were too glaring to ignore up close. His shoulders slumped as he gazed down at the mess he’d made. It was a hollow victory, the result one could only present with a sense of resignation.
As the man gathered his things. He glanced over at Eddie, still hunched at his desk, a figure almost too still amidst the surrounding motion. Eddie hadn’t moved, his back hunched, his silver hair falling over his brow as he scribbled fiercely. The man noted the clean desk in front of him, untouched by alchemical tools or spilt materials. Unlike the others, whose desks were filled with charred parchment, broken equipment, and hastily drawn diagrams, Eddie’s desk remained neat, his only sign of progress the array of scrolls he’d been writing on.
A tinge of curiosity mixed with his disbelief as he approached Eddie’s desk. His footsteps were slow and hesitant. “Um, young sir,” he began, his voice unsure, “The time is up. You should head to the examiner.”
Eddie didn’t look up. His fingers continued to scrawl furiously across the parchment. Eyes locked on the words in front of him, as though the test was not over and he could finish what he had set out to do. His brow furrowed, the ink on his quill drying in the faint, warm light of the room.
“Five more minutes,” Eddie muttered under his breath, a statement of utter conviction.
The older alchemist stood momentarily longer, watching Eddie’s unwavering focus. It was strange—this young man, sitting amidst a sea of failure, so determined. He turned away slowly, his impure Gold hanging heavily in his hand. The weight of his own doubts mirrored in the younger man’s steadfastness. The older candidate’s eyes lingered for a moment longer on Eddie’s desk, then he left, the sound of his footsteps fading as he made his way to the examiner’s room.
Eddie, still hunched over his scrolls, ignored the man’s departure. His world was contained within the ink lines before him, and he wouldn’t stop now. There was no time for doubts, no time for second guesses. He had a purpose. He had to prove something—not to anyone else but himself.
As the last few minutes ticked away. The orange light outside deepened, casting long shadows across Eddie’s desk. His quill scratched the parchment, the soft sound the only sign of life in the otherwise still room. And though he knew he would not be bringing Gold before the examiners. Eddie was more confident than ever that what he had written—what he had set out to prove—was the honest answer to this impossible test.
o-
Master Alchemist Magnus Borman sat in the examination room. Flipping through the results with a deep frown. His eyes scanned the various reports, each more disheartening than the last. The candidates had not impressed him in the slightest. He sighed heavily, his breath a mix of exhaustion and disappointment. The Gold produced by the candidates was impure. Full of imperfections that made it almost laughable. Some had even resorted to illusion spells to trick. Tricking the examiners into thinking they had succeeded. Others hadn’t even bothered to transmute their Lead at all. It was as if the essence of alchemy had been lost to these so-called “prodigies.” His mind wandered to the past, to the alchemists who had once dazzled him with their brilliance, the ones who had been faithful to the craft.
“Is there any great Alchemist still around?” he muttered, his tone tinged with exhaustion and disappointment.
Emma Somers perched elegantly in her chair. Sipped her tea, her gaze flicking briefly over to Borman. “There might be one,” she replied, her voice calm and measured. “This one is a student and niece of the renowned Master Alchemist Catherine, the Elf.”
The Wizard Aelfric looked up from the results with a raised brow. “Oh?” he asked, his interest piqued. “The Elf had a niece?”
Emma nodded as she set her cup down on the saucer, her expression unreadable. “It was her adopted sister. She lived with the Welton family for many years and considers Alyssa Welton to be her own sister. They’re not blood-related, but that’s what they are to each other.”
“Very interesting,” Wizard Aelfric chimed in, his voice light and amused as he added sugar to his tea. The Chancellor of Edenfield University was intrigued, the notion of a niece of such a legendary alchemist catching his attention. “I hadn’t heard of this.”
Borman nodded slowly, his fingers tapping the edge of the table. “It is said that she’s an entirely different league. It’s not an easy path, following in Catherine the Elf’s footsteps.”
Emma gave a slight nod, eyes sharp and focused. “Indeed. Let’s see what this young one has accomplished.”
Wizard Aelfric chuckled softly. “Well then, let’s not keep him waiting. Can we move on to the next candidate?”
Emma’s gaze flicked toward the announcer as she gave a subtle nod. The announcer, standing nearby, understood the signal and stepped forward. Preparing to call the next name.
The announcer’s voice boomed through the hall. Cutting through the air with precision and authority. “Edward Welton, please go to the examination room!”
Borman, Aelfric, and Emma turned their attention toward the door. Their thoughts all momentarily on the young man who would soon be entering. Edward Welton. A name that meant little to most but could hold the promise of something extraordinary. They waited, intrigued by what he might bring to the table.
Eddie entered the examination room. His unruly silver hair fell around his determined, slightly angry face. His green eyes glinted with a fire that had only been fuelled by the day’s frustration. He strode to the desk. Looking carefully at the three examiners. Master Alchemist Borman, Wizard Aelfric, and Emma Somers—were seated before him. The air in the room was tense, but Eddie stood resolutely. As if the weight of the test had already been settled in his mind.
“Now, if you please, the exam result,” Master Alchemist Borman said. His voice was crisp and commanding.
Eddie didn’t hesitate. With a deep breath, he placed his scrolls on the desk, the paper unassuming at first glance. But the quiet confidence in his posture said otherwise. He met Borman’s gaze, his expression unwavering.
The examiners exchanged puzzled looks. Borman raised an eyebrow, his lips curling into a smirk. There was a subtle trace of offence in his tone as he spoke, his words coated with a hint of sarcasm.
“If I remembered correctly,” Borman began. Leaning forward with a sharp glint in his eyes, “The task is to turn Lead into gold, not Lead into papers, Mr Welton.”
Eddie didn’t flinch. Instead, he remained focused, his voice steady as he responded.
“It is simply impossible, sir,” Eddie said, calm but firm. “So I didn’t bother.”
Borman’s eyes narrowed, his irritation growing. A flicker of intrigue lingered beneath the surface. “You don’t even return the Lead?” he asked, incredulity in his voice. “Now, what makes you think we won’t fail you right here?”
A tense silence filled the room, the weight of Borman’s words hanging heavily in the air. Eddie stood his ground, his jaw set, refusing to be intimidated. The examiners continued to scrutinise him. Each one weighed his decision and tried to understand what he had done.
Ever the observer, Emma Somers studied Eddie’s face carefully, her expression unreadable. She had seen potential in this boy before. But now, with his unorthodox approach. She wondered if he had just crossed the line between genius and madness. He is, indeed, the apprentice of Catherine the Elf. Wizard Aelfric, who had remained silent until now, tilted his head thoughtfully, his ancient eyes scanning Eddie’s demeanour.
The silence stretched, and Eddie could feel the eyes of the examiners on him, but he didn’t flinch. He knew he had done the right thing. After all, this was a test not just of skill, but of understanding the true nature of alchemy itself.
It was Borman who broke the silence, his voice low and measured. “What exactly do you expect us to learn from this, Mr Welton? This is not a test of your beliefs. This is a test of your capability. And as far as I can see, you’ve wasted your time.”
Eddie’s eyes didn’t waver. “I haven’t wasted anything. I’ve done exactly what alchemy teaches us. Transformation is about understanding the limits of what is possible and recognising when the impossible is just a lie we’ve been taught to believe.”
Emma’s gaze softened ever so slightly, impressed by his conviction. Aelfric raised a brow, intrigued by Eddie’s response. Borman, however, remained unimpressed. His mouth tightened into a thin line, his disappointment evident.
As the examiners looked at the scrolls Eddie had placed before them, the tension in the room was palpable. Eddie, his silver hair still falling messily around his face. He now stood behind a large whiteboard. Dragging it into place with a steady, determined grip. The motion caught the examiners’ attention, who slowly shifted their focus from the scrolls to Eddie himself.
Master Alchemist Borman, still sceptical, folded his arms. The glint of curiosity was starting to edge into his sharp gaze. Wizard Aelfric’s eyes, though ancient and calm, sparked with a flicker of intrigue. Emma Somers, always composed, leaned forward slightly, the faintest trace of a smile tugging at the corner of her lips as she waited for Eddie to explain himself.
Eddie cleared his throat. Glancing at the three of them before he began, his voice steady and unwavering. “There is no way for lead to turn into gold,” he started, the weight of his words sinking in. “Alchemy isn’t about bending reality to meet impossible standards as it was with Sorcery and Conjuration. Alchemy is about understanding the limits of nature. And, when those limits are found, knowing where to push them—ethically, with purpose, as cited in Sage Myrddin’s codex Ethics of Magic.”
The room was silent as Eddie approached the chalkboard, picking up a piece of chalk. He drew a series of complicated diagrams, symbols, and intricate notations. His hands moved with a fluidity that suggested a deep familiarity with the subject matter. His eyes were intense, focused on the board, but he spoke as if he were in a lecture, explaining his thoughts aloud.
“This test asked for Lead to Gold,” Eddie continued. His tone is now a mix of frustration and awe, “But alchemy tells us that such a thing is a myth. A metaphor for a transformation that is spiritual and not physical, as cited by Master Alchemist Catherine, The Elf. Lead is a base metal, but it symbolises something more. It represents potential, untapped power.” He glanced at Borman briefly before continuing. The words flowed from him as he recalled the teachings of Catherine. “However, the texts, the codices I’ve studied. Tell us that, with the proper methodology, one could create a hypothetical pathway to transmute Lead into something closer to Gold. Not in a simple, transmutative sense, but through a deeper understanding of materials, energy, and elemental forces.”
He paused, running his hand through his hair in frustration. “I’ve crafted this hypothetical analysis. A detailed procedure. Mixing theory and practice, drawing from ancient techniques taught by Catherine the Elf. Some dating back thousands of years. These aren’t just spell formulas, but techniques that consider the nature of the base metals, their relationship to Gold, and the raw energy required for such an endeavour.”
The room was quiet as Eddie turned to the board, walking them through the steps of the spell he had devised. There were complex symbols, sigils, and diagrams, each an integral part of the process. Eddie spoke quickly, explaining how the technique must be executed under precise conditions. With the right catalyst and ancient text passed down through generations of scholars and alchemists.
“By combining elemental transmutation techniques,” Eddie said, “And incorporating older, almost forgotten spells. Ones only a few would know—I believe you could, in theory, create the conditions needed for Lead to transform into Gold. Not by physical means alone. But by manipulating the inherent energies within both metals, balancing them.” He finished with a flourish. Stepping back, his chest rising and falling as he exhaled. His eyes scanned the three examiners’ expressions.
Master Alchemist Borman’s mouth was slightly ajar as he studied Eddie’s work. He had expected a failure. Something half-hearted, perhaps a hastily scribbled theory or nonsense. Instead, there was structure, logic, and depth to Eddie’s reasoning.
Wizard Aelfric was nodding slowly, his fingers stroking his beard. “You’ve taken what was meant to be a challenge and turned it into an exploration of possibility, “ He murmured, more to himself than anyone else.
Emma Somers was still as composed as ever, though now her eyes had an appreciative gleam. “The test asked for transmutation,” she said, quiet but approving. “Not just of Lead to Gold, but of thought—transforming a seemingly impossible task into something meaningful. You’ve done that.”
The room seemed to hold its breath. Borman exhaled sharply, shaking his head with frustration and respect. “A lot of words, Mr. Welton,” he said, his voice still stern. “But no gold.”
Eddie met his gaze, unflinching. “No, sir. There is no gold. There’s a truth, though. A gold that cannot be touched, only understood.”
Emma glanced at the scrolls Eddie had placed before them and then back at him, her voice soft but firm. “You’ve done something no one else here has done, Eddie. You didn’t just try to follow an impossible directive. You questioned it, challenged it, and turned it into a meaningful exploration.”
Aelfric chuckled softly, leaning back in his chair. “The boy’s stubborn, but he has the spirit of an Alchemist.”
Emma sighed, smiling, “That’s the apprentice of Catherine the Elf for you.”
Borman sighed, his disappointment still evident but tempered by a grudging respect. “Perhaps… but can an Alchemist afford to spend so much time on what is impossible?”
Eddie stood a little straighter, his voice steady. “Maybe it’s impossible now. But it’s never a waste to explore the boundaries of the impossible.”
There was a long pause. Eddie’s scrolls—his answer to the task—were laid out before the examiners, unlike the other candidates. Eddie had not presented Gold or fake Gold. But something far more valuable in the eyes of the examiners: a way of thinking. Feeling the weight of his mentor’s teachings and his own frustrations. It finally comes together in a meaningful way. The impossible had been challenged. And that, he thought, was the actual goal.
Eddie stood there, watching the three examiners scribble notes on their notepads. He couldn’t help but feel exhaustion and relief wash over him. The weight of the test, the tension in the room, the suffocating pressure of the impossible task—it was all over now. He’d done his part.
“You may not have successfully transmuted Lead to Gold in the traditional sense, Mr Welton. But you’ve proven something else. You’ve proven you understand Alchemy better than most other candidates.” Master Borman muttered, his voice dripping with reluctant approval. But there was no mistaking the thin veil of annoyance in his tone, his pride clearly bruised. He didn’t like being outshone, especially not by a young candidate with unruly silver hair and a cocky, confident air about him.
“Now get the hell out of my examination room,” Borman finished, his stern gaze unwavering.
Eddie caught the slight twitch of Borman’s lip. The barely contained irritation in his voice and it made him smirk just slightly. A blow to his ego, Eddie thought, but he wouldn’t rub it in. He didn’t have to. His own rigid approach to the test had already bested by him.
Wizard Aelfric, on the other hand, seemed far more entertained. A glint of pleasure danced in his eyes as he leaned back in his chair. He was clearly satisfied with Eddie’s performance. His hands moved lazily, absentmindedly adjusting his robes as he let out a low chuckle, clearly pleased with how things unfolded. A clever young one, Aelfric must have been thinking. He is not easily deterred and quick on his feet.
Emma Somers, though, smiled at Eddie in a way that felt both approving and secretive. There was no outward judgment, only a subtle satisfaction in her expression. The slight arch of her brow said more than words ever could. She, at least, seemed to appreciate the depth of his answer. Not merely because he had defied the task’s original constraints, but for how he had reframed the entire test in a new light.
“You can get the souvenirs at the reception desk on your way out, Mr Welton,” Emma said. Her voice was gentle, yet still carrying that hint of authority that made it clear she was in charge of the candidates’ fates.
Eddie nodded, stifling a smile as he approached the door, only for Emma’s voice to stop him. “Oh, and before you leave, Edward…” she called out, her tone laced with just enough amusement to catch his attention.
Eddie paused, half-turning back. “Yes?”
Emma met his eyes, her smile widening. “You’re not fighting a bear with a toothpick,” she said, her words soft yet pointed. “You’re much more capable than you give yourself credit for.” She gave him a knowing look.
Eddie’s cheeks flushed, a wave of embarrassment creeping over him. He managed a sheepish smile, scratching the back of his head. “Uh… Thank you, Mrs Somers,” he muttered, cheeks warm as he tried to hold on to his remaining dignity, knowing she had heard him curse back in the examination room.
Without a word, Eddie turned and exited the examination room. The door clicked shut behind him with a finality that made his chest rise and fall in a heavy breath. The hallway outside was quiet, the faint echo of footsteps from other candidates still lingering in the air.
He made his way to the reception desk, each step feeling lighter as the weight of the exam and its uncertainty fell away from him.
Souvenirs, he thought with a half-smile. It seemed almost fitting. He hadn’t come out of the exam with Gold but with something more valuable: an answer, his own. And that was worth far more than any gilded trophy. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 0E</Title>
            <Text>The only sounds in the cavernous library of Edenfield University were the scratching of quills and the whisper-soft turning of pages. A single orb of captured moonlight hovered over their table, casting long, dancing shadows that made the towering bookshelves look like sleeping giants. It was well past the midnight curfew, a fact that hummed under Eddie’s skin with a low-grade anxiety.
They called themselves the Midnight Study Group, a name Ashley had coined with a dramatic flair. Tonight, the core of the group—the first-years—were huddled together over a mess of notes and diagrams for their Magical Basics final.
&quot;If you overcharge the mana conduit, the entire matrix will destabilize,&quot; Will murmured, his brow furrowed in concentration as he traced a glowing blue line on the project diagram with his finger. &quot;Professor Grimsby said the failure cascade is… 'un-subtle.'&quot;
&quot;‘Un-subtle’ is code for ‘it’ll blow a hole in the lab and we’ll get detention for a month’,&quot; Ashley Mayfair countered, leaning back in her chair so far it groaned in protest. She twirled a lock of her vibrant hair. &quot;I say we push it. What's the point of magic if you don't find the breaking point?&quot;
Will shot her a look. &quot;Because we'd like to pass, Ashley. By-the-book. No explosions.&quot;
Eddie remained quiet, his own ambition warring with his innate passivity. He wanted the A, the pride that came with excelling, but the idea of drawing that much attention—good or bad—made his stomach clench. He was an Alchemist. His discipline was the study of change, of transformation. It was a cosmic joke that he, Edward Welton, who feared change more than anything, had chosen it. He saw it as a path to creation, a way to build something he could be proud of. He just preferred to ignore the chaotic, deconstructive side of the equation.
He scanned their shared notes, a growing sense of dread pooling in his gut. The key transmutation formulas, the ones he’d painstakingly cross-referenced… they weren’t there.
&quot;Ah, hell,&quot; he muttered, the words sharp in the quiet.
Will and Ashley looked at him. &quot;What's up?&quot; Will asked.
&quot;My primary notes. The good ones. I left them in our dorm.&quot; Eddie's shoulders slumped. &quot;We can't finish the core calculations without them.&quot;
Will’s face tightened. &quot;The dorm? Eddie, it's almost 2 a.m. The Regiments are out in force tonight. They’re not just sending people back to their rooms anymore. I heard they put two second-years on probation for being out by the greenhouses.&quot;
&quot;So? We're not going to let a few glorified hall monitors stop us from getting a good grade, are we?&quot; Ashley’s eyes glinted with challenge. She looked at Eddie. &quot;You need to go get them. I'll help.&quot;
This was it. A scenario to be avoided. A disruption. His first instinct was to say no, to suggest they pack it in and try again tomorrow. But the thought of slinking away in failure, of not having that thing he could be proud of, stung. This was his contribution to the project.
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eddie heard himself say, his voice firmer than he expected. &quot;Okay, I'll go.&quot;
Ashley grinned. &quot;That's the spirit.&quot; She moved her hands in a series of fluid, complex gestures, her painted nails leaving faint trails of violet light in the air. She whispered a phrase that sounded like running water and held her palms out to him. A shimmering, liquid-like veil of energy coalesced between them. &quot;Basic Witchcraft. A mirror veil. It won't make you invisible, but it'll distort the light around you. To a passing glance, you'll look like a ripple in the air, a trick of the moonlight. Just don't let a patrol get too close.&quot;
Eddie took the veil, which felt like cool, weightless silk, and draped it over himself. The world hazed over, the edges of the bookshelves blurring as if seen through a rain-streaked window.
&quot;Be careful, Eddie,&quot; Will said, his earnest worry cutting through Ashley's bravado.
Eddie just nodded, his heart hammering against his ribs, and slipped out of the library's massive oak doors into the cold, silent campus.
The grounds of Edenfield were beautiful and menacing by night. The gothic spires of the lecture halls clawed at the star-dusted sky. Every shadow seemed to hold a threat. Eddie moved quickly, his feet silent on the flagstones, keeping to the lines of manicured hedges. He could hear the rhythmic thud of boots and a sharp laugh echo from a distant quad—a Student Regiment patrol. He ducked behind a statue of the university's founder, his breath held tight in his chest as three uniformed students marched past, their faces grim and self-important. This was stupid. This was reckless. This was a change from his normal, safe routine.
He was cutting across the smaller courtyard near the Alchemy faculty when he saw him. A figure slumped on a bench.
Eddie froze. It was another student, his head lolling to the side. Did he just fall asleep out here? In this cold? It was bizarre. The patrols were so strict, how could they have missed him? Eddie felt a prickle of annoyance. He was risking his own neck, and this guy was just napping in the open.
He took a hesitant step closer, the mirror veil clinging to him. &quot;Hey,&quot; he whispered, but the sound died in his throat.
The student wasn't sleeping. He slid from the bench with a soft, boneless thump, landing on the grass below. And he was being dragged.
Eddie's blood ran cold. He squinted, trying to make sense of the scene. A figure was standing over the fallen student, a figure that hadn't been there a second ago. It was tall and unnaturally thin, clad in a perfectly tailored, dark woolen suit. But that's where the normality ended. A long, scaled tail, thick as a python, was wrapped around the student's ankle, dragging him slowly but inexorably into the deeper shadows of a large oak tree. The creature's back was a ridge of sharp, crystalline spikes that jutted through the fine fabric of its jacket.
Panic, stark and absolute, seized Eddie. Run. Hide. Forget you saw this. This was the &quot;Something&quot; from the rumors. This was why there was a curfew. This was a monster in a suit, and it was stealing a student right in front of him. The passive part of him, the part that craved safety and abhorred change, screamed at him to dissolve back into the night. No one would know. He could go back to the library, tell Will he lost his nerve. He could go on living his life, unchanged.
But then, the creature shifted, and the faint moonlight caught the unconscious student's face. Eddie didn't know his name, but he'd seen him around. A quiet kid from the Automatons major. He looked so young, so helpless.
And a new thought rose up, drowning out the fear with a white-hot burn: If I walk away, what will I be? Who can be proud of a coward?
The lie he had lived by—that he could get through life without change—crumbled into dust. To do nothing was a choice, a change into something he would despise.
His hand, shaking but resolute, reached into his satchel. His fingers closed around the cool, metallic surface of his collapsible alchemist's staff. With a flick of his wrist, it telescoped out to its full length with a series of soft clicks. The sound was deafening in the silence.
The creature in the suit froze. Its head swiveled towards the sound, towards the ripple in the air where Eddie stood. It had no face, only a smooth, pale expanse of skin, but Eddie felt its attention lock onto him like a physical blow.
He had to do something. He had to change what was happening.
Dropping the mirror veil, Eddie stepped out of the shadows, revealing himself. He planted his feet, gripping the staff, his knuckles white. He wasn't a warrior. He wasn't a hero. He was a first-year Alchemist. But right now, under the moon on the silent grounds of Edenfield, he was the only thing standing between that student and the encroaching darkness. And for the first time, he felt a flicker of something he could almost call pride.

[Battle Start]

[Battle End] 
The roar of the flames and the creature's unearthly shriek faded into the oppressive quiet of the night, leaving only the crackle of the lingering fire and the sound of Eddie's own ragged breaths. He leaned against the rough brick wall of the Alchemy faculty, his chest heaving, every muscle trembling with leftover adrenaline.
It was over. The creature was gone.
A grin, wide and uncontrollable, stretched across his face. It was a manic, breathless expression that was half relief and half pure, unadulterated triumph. He’d done it. He, Eddie Welton—the passive, change-averse Alchemist—had faced down a literal monster and won. He hadn't just run; he'd used his knowledge, transmuting the ventilation pipe's grating to buckle and then using the stray sparks from his staff striking the pavement to ignite the sudden gust of air. It was desperate, clumsy, and probably wrecked a university utility line, but it had worked.
Across the courtyard, he saw movement. The student, the one from the Automatons major, was stirring. He pushed himself up on his elbows, looking around in a daze. In the distance, the rhythmic march of the Student Regiment patrol grew louder, their lantern lights cutting through the darkness. They’d spotted the commotion. Eddie watched as one of the uniformed patrollers knelt by the student, who was now pointing with a shaking finger towards the direction the creature had fled. He was safe. They were handling it.
Eddie felt a surge of satisfaction so potent it almost made him dizzy. This feeling… this was it. This was something he could be proud of.
He pushed himself off the wall, the triumphant smile still plastered on his face. Right, he thought, his mind clearing slightly. The notes. Will and Ashley are still waiting. He needed to get to his dorm and get back to the library before the entire campus was on lockdown.
He took a step, and a sharp, lancing pain shot up from his calf. He hissed, his triumphant grin vanishing as he stumbled, catching himself against the wall again. He looked down. His leg was limp, refusing to properly take his weight. Confused, he ran a hand down his calf, his fingers brushing against something thin, sharp, and deeply embedded in the muscle through his torn trousers.
It was one of the creature’s spikes. A thin, crystalline shard, almost like black glass, no longer than his thumb. It must have broken off and pierced his leg when he’d scrambled away from one of its lunges. He hadn’t even felt it in the heat of the moment.
“Great,” he muttered, his earlier victory already feeling distant. He braced himself against the wall and tried to pull the shard out. His fingers were slick with blood, and the spike was lodged deeper than he thought. It wouldn't budge. A wave of frustration washed over him. He gave it another, harder tug.
That’s when it happened.
A wave of exhaustion, thick and syrupy, washed over him. It wasn't the normal tiredness from a fight; this was a heavy, unnatural blanket descending on his mind. His eyelids suddenly weighed a ton. The sharp edges of the university spires began to blur, their dark shapes swimming in his vision. The distant shouts of the patrol sounded distorted, as if coming from underwater.
What’s happening?
He tried to focus, to shake the feeling off, but it was like trying to swim against a current. The world tilted violently. The ground seemed to rush up to meet him. He felt the cold, unforgiving stone of the courtyard path against his cheek.
His thoughts turned to mud. The spike… it’s not just a spike…
It was a quill. A stinger. An injection.
His last conscious thought was not of his victory, nor of his notes, but of the profound irony of it all. He, the Alchemist who had finally embraced a chaotic change, was now being unwillingly transformed by the very thing he fought.
The world dissolved into a silent, dreamless black. Unseen by the patrols now busy with the other student, Eddie Welton lay unconscious on the university grounds, the dark, crystalline shard still embedded in his leg, pulsing with a faint, malevolent energy.

            <Notes>
1. They are studying at the library late at night, past the curfiew hours. They are officially known among themselves as the Midnight Study Group. Which at the moment consists of Eddie, Will, Ashley, Madeleine (2nd year), Claire (2nd year), and Henry (4th year) who tags along since he have to spend extra hours getting books for his thesis citations.

2. Eddie, Ashley and Will is huddled together, since they are in 1st years, they still have a class where all the majors are joined, this time they are in a group project for their finals for their Magical Basics course.

As they need to do something, Eddie then forgot his note back at the dorm, and so he excused himself to go back and get it. What he did is dangerous since it is still Curfiew hours. And so Eddie asked Ashley who is in Witchcraft to conjure him a mirror veil, a basic spell that create a veil that mirror things like water

3. Eddie snuck out of the library into the university grounds, navigating through the campus grounds, evading Student Council members, and Student Regiment patrols (Note that the Student Council is the representative of the Edenfield Students, whilst the Student Regiment is an enforcer created through Student Council, the Student Regiment is born from a historical moment where students of Edenfield helps fight a war as a regiment, and so it is honored by creating the Student Regiment, although its uses has been warped lately by the Student Council.)As he snuck around, he found someone falling asleep on one of the benches, which is weird. It is past curfiew, it is night, why isn’t anybody waking him up, did he just fall asleep?As Eddie walks closer, he then sees that the lone student is slowly getting dragged, he fell on the groundsNow Eddie panics, what the hell just happened? He reaches through his collapsible staffAs he got closer, he could see it. It’s a hidious creature, the creature is wearing a suit, but it has a long tail that is dragging the student, the backs is full of spikesEddie have to do something

            <Title>Chapter 10E</Title>
            <Text>Eddie approached Henry's vintage car, its gleaming chrome a beacon in the otherwise ordinary student parking lot. The car, a testament to Henry's ingenuity, buzzed with nervous energy as the team awaited him.
&quot;Morning, everyone,&quot; Eddie greeted, the question hanging heavy in the air. &quot;Everyone ready for this?&quot;
A chorus of groans and muttered replies answered him. &quot;Took you long enough, man!&quot; Jake grumbled, while Jane added, &quot;Yeah, hop in, we've got a tight schedule!&quot;
As Eddie neared the car, his gaze scanned the backseat, landing on a familiar mop of red hair. Madeleine, clad in a more casual outfit - a green flannel shirt and jeans - offered him a warm smile. Her usual meticulous hairstyle was replaced by half-up curls that danced around her face.
&quot;Hey, Madeleine,&quot; Eddie said, his voice softening. &quot;Didn't expect to see you here.&quot;
&quot;Couldn't let you guys do this without me,&quot; she replied, the determination in her eyes mirroring his own.
A sharp voice sliced through their moment. &quot;Great, now we have the whole circus.&quot; Eddie's smile faltered as his eyes landed on Christine and Geralt seated next to Madeleine. The source of the voice was unmistakable - Christine, radiating her usual brand of disdain.
&quot;Henry,&quot; Eddie gritted out, frustration building in his voice. He tried to maintain composure. &quot;What are they doing here?&quot;
&quot;They?&quot; Henry's brow furrowed in confusion. &quot;What do you mean 'they'?&quot;
Eddie pointed towards the backseat, his voice strained. &quot;Them!&quot;
Henry sighed. &quot;They've got a stake in this too, Eddie. Dominic's missing, remember?&quot;
&quot;I know that!&quot; Eddie snapped. &quot;Why are they with us?&quot;
”Typical Edward,” Said Christine, crossing her arms, “You think you’re the only one who can help? We don’t need some outsider from a no-name coastal town telling us what to do.”
”At least I’m not pretending to be better than everyone else just because of where I come from! Your posh, show-off behavior isn’t going to help us find anyone!” Eddie countered,
”At least I belong here, unlike some people who had to claw their way in from nowhere. You’re just a charity case.”
”You don’t know anything about me or where I come from. I’ve worked hard to be here, unlike you who had everything handed to you on a silver platter.”
&quot;Enough! Both of you, cut it out!&quot; Henry barked, &quot;This is my car, and I'm not driving anywhere with you two bickering like children!&quot;
Madeleine, ever the mediator, interjected. &quot;Henry's right. We all need to work together. Save the fighting for later.&quot;
Christine grumbled a grudging agreement, followed by a jab at Eddie. &quot;But keep that fish-smelling runt away from me.&quot;
&quot;The feeling's mutual, daddy's sorceress,&quot; Eddie retorted, his eyes blazing.
Henry, his patience wearing thin, laid down the law. &quot;Right. Madeleine, Geralt, sit between them. We can't have them at each other's throats. Eddie, go sit in the back, we have no other spaces.&quot;
Defeated, Eddie slumped into the back seat, Madeleine and Geralt creating a much-needed buffer between him and Christine. Sensing the tension, Madeleine offered a calming presence. &quot;Let's just focus on the mission,&quot; she said softly. &quot;We need to find Ashley and the others.&quot; She turned to Christine and Geralt, adding, &quot;And Dominic too, he must've been scared there.&quot;
Christine's usually scornful expression softened. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she muttered. &quot;He is easily panicked, he must've been really scared.&quot;
Eddie, taking a deep breath, finally relented. &quot;Yeah, Ashley too. You're right. Let's do this.&quot;
Henry surveyed the team, a tense silence hanging in the air. &quot;Alright, everyone ready?&quot; he asked, a hint of determination in his voice. &quot;Let's get this show on the road.&quot;
With a roar of the engine, Henry peeled out of the parking lot, the car carrying them towards their uncertain fate. The air crackled with tension, but beneath it all, a single, unyielding purpose burned bright – to find their friends and bring them home.
The car's engine hummed a gentle lullaby, a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside. Henry's meticulous restoration had gifted the vehicle a smooth purr that blended seamlessly with the city's symphony of sounds - distant chatter, the melodic chime of a bicycle bell, and the rhythmic call of a street vendor. White-wall tires glided effortlessly over the uneven cobblestones, navigating the historic streets with practiced ease.
Inside Henry's rolling sanctuary, however, the air crackled with tension. The students – a motley crew of heroes thrust into extraordinary circumstances – sat in a tense tableau. Henry, Will, Madeleine, Eddie, Jake, Jane, Christine, and Geralt – each face etched with a mix of apprehension and unwavering resolve.
The cityscape of Edenfield unfolded before them, a kaleidoscope of architectural styles. Ornate Victorian townhouses jostled for space with the sturdy frames of early industrial warehouses. Many structures wore their history proudly - intricate carvings adorned their facades, wrought-iron balconies offered a glimpse into bygone eras, and faded murals whispered tales of the city's rich academic past.
Yet, the scenery failed to capture their attention. Awkward silences hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the leather seats. The weight of their mission pressed down on them, a shared burden that threatened to suffocate conversation.
Henry, stealing a glance through the rearview mirror at the silent passengers, let out a barely audible sigh. He leaned towards Will, his voice a low murmur, &quot;Let's get this over with, Will. I can't bear this tension any longer.&quot;
Will, ever the optimist, attempted to lighten the mood. Craning his neck towards the backseat, he offered a weak smile. &quot;So, anyone got a good joke?&quot;
His question echoed unanswered, swallowed by the thick tension that permeated the car. Jake muttered under his breath, &quot;This is gonna be a long ride.&quot;
Jane nudged him playfully, a silent plea for him to keep quiet. The silence, though suffocating, was a fragile bubble. They were on the precipice of a perilous journey, and any attempt to break the tension felt like a fragile dance on a tightrope. The weight of their mission hung heavy, a constant reminder of the darkness that awaited them. Yet, beneath the surface, a flicker of determination burned bright. They were in this together, bound by a shared purpose, and that silent understanding was a powerful force in itself.
The oppressive silence continued as the car transitioned from the city's bustling core to the quiet hum of suburbia. Cobblestone streets gave way to smooth asphalt, winding through neighborhoods adorned with manicured lawns and towering trees. The rhythmic purr of the engine was the only constant, a stark contrast to the turmoil within.
In a desperate attempt to break the tension, Henry reached for the radio dial. The knob hissed and crackled before settling on a station, and a blast of static gave way to the opening notes of an old rock song.
&quot;Through the night, we'll find a way&quot;
&quot;Hearts united, come what may&quot;
&quot;Whispers of hope in the silent air&quot;
&quot;Together we'll show we truly care&quot;
Will, a flicker of recognition sparking in his eyes, began to hum along softly as the song transitioned into the pre-chorus. He knew this song – &quot;Rescue from Without&quot; – a classic anthem of resilience that resonated with their situation.
&quot;We won't let the darkness take&quot;
&quot;The ones we love, we'll never break&quot;
&quot;With every step, our spirits grow&quot;
&quot;A light in the dark, a warm, soft glow&quot;
As if catching Will's quiet melody, Jake and Jane joined in, their voices filling the car for the first time since they'd set off. The chorus erupted, a declaration of unity that echoed through the confined space.
&quot;Together we'll rise, side by side&quot;
&quot;In the shadows, we won't hide&quot;
&quot;Rescue from the shadows, we'll fight&quot;
&quot;Hold on, we'll make it through the night&quot;
The second verse started softer, a lull in the storm. Will's voice was the only one that carried the melody.
&quot;Against the odds, we're standing strong&quot;
&quot;In every heart, a battle song&quot;
&quot;We'll lift you up, when you're feeling down&quot;
&quot;A circle of friends, love's profound&quot;
But the pre-chorus brought them back together. A surge of determination fueled their voices.
&quot;We won't let the darkness take&quot;
&quot;The ones we love, we'll never break&quot;
&quot;With every step, our spirits grow&quot;
&quot;A light in the dark, a warm, soft glow&quot;
Eddie felt a shift in the atmosphere. He glanced towards Madeleine, a hint of a smile gracing her lips as she tapped her foot to the beat. The tension, though not entirely gone, seemed to loosen its grip. She belted out the chorus with newfound fervor, and soon the entire car was filled with their voices.
Even Christine, a bastion of stoicism, couldn't resist the infectious energy. A small smile played on her lips as she hummed along, a grudging acceptance of the situation.
The bridge arrived, and a hush fell over the group. Everyone expected Will, with his musical background, to take the reins. But to their surprise, it was Henry who broke the silence. His voice, rich and unexpected, filled the car.
&quot;When hope seems far, just take my hand&quot;
&quot;We're here for you, we understand&quot;
&quot;We'll pave the way, no matter how long&quot;
&quot;With every tear, we'll build you strong&quot;
Will, seizing the momentum, cued the final build-up. &quot;Come on everyone!&quot; he shouted, and a wave of collective energy washed over them.
&quot;Together we'll rise, side by side&quot;
&quot;In the shadows, we won't hide&quot;
&quot;Rescue from the shadows, we'll fight&quot;
&quot;Hold on, we'll make it through the night!&quot;
Eddie, caught up in the moment, swayed to the music, his voice joining the chorus. The car, once a vessel of tense silence, was now a rolling embodiment of camaraderie. Laughter mingled with the music, a testament to the bond that was being forged in the face of adversity.
The final verse faded out, replaced by the soft strains of the outro. Will's voice, barely a whisper, carried the last lines.
&quot;Through the night, we'll find a way&quot;
&quot;Hearts united, come what may&quot;
&quot;Rescue from the shadows, we'll fight&quot;
&quot;Together, we'll make it through the night&quot;
The car rolled on, carrying them deeper into the suburbs. The music had served its purpose, a temporary balm on their collective anxieties. But beneath the newfound sense of unity, a steely resolve remained. They were on a mission, a desperate rescue attempt, and the weight of that mission pressed heavily on their hearts. Yet, as they sang together, a flicker of hope ignited. They were in this together, and together, they were ready to face whatever darkness awaited them. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 34 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Torrie sat cross-legged on the living room floor, arranging her dolls in a perfect little row. She’d given each one a name and decided they’d be attending a royal tea party, except half weren’t appropriately dressed yet.
“Torrie, breakfast is almost ready,” her mother called from the kitchen. “Could you wake your brother?”
Torrie sighed, setting her favourite doll down reluctantly. She padded down the hallway. The soft creak of the stairs blended into the gentle quiet of the apothecary. Torrie ascended with quick steps, the narrow wooden staircase winding gracefully toward the attic. The polished railings were smooth beneath her fingers, a familiar comfort. Golden beams of light streamed through a small, round window at the landing. It casts warm patterns that danced across the walls as she moved.
With every step, the bustling hum of the town below grew softer. Replaced by the calm stillness that seemed to embrace her brother’s room. Her free hand brushed fondly against the walls as she climbed. Her fingertips traced the worn patches and faint scuffs. Silent reminders of her brother’s younger, carefree days. When the house often rang with his laughter and playful mischief.
At the top of the stairs, she paused before the attic door. The wood was solid yet softened by years of quiet conversations and shared moments. Torrie closed her eyes for a brief, steadying breath, a gentle smile tugging at her lips as she raised her hand.
She knocked on the door, the sound soft and familiar, a tender rhythm that seemed to whisper of care, “Eddie! Breakfast!” she shouted, her voice slipping into a singsong tone as she leaned her ear against the door. Silence.
After a pause, Torrie set her jaw and gave one last, insistent knock, her patience thinning. “Eddie, if you’re in there and ignoring me, I’m telling Mum!”
“Go away, Torrie.“ a faint mumbling voice could be heard behind the door
Her eyes narrowed, her frustration growing. Of course, Eddie was in there. Probably still sulking from the exam or pretending to sleep through breakfast. Torrie had no time for this. She had a world of dolls to organise, and Eddie was completely uncooperative.
She reached into her skirt’s pocket, fingers brushing against her new wand. A small, polished piece of wood—still unfamiliar to her grasp but powerful enough to get the job done. With a quick flick and a murmur of the unlocking incantation her mother had taught her, she felt the familiar tingle of magic work through her fingertips. The door handle clicked open.
Torrie grinned, pushing the door just enough to slip inside.
“Finally,“ she muttered to herself.
But as the door creaked open, she couldn’t help but feel a twinge of excitement. This was her first time using her wand on her own—unlocking her brother’s door was, in a way, a minor triumph.
Torrie slipped inside and wrinkled her nose at the overwhelming mix of smells. Burnt metal, and a strange smokiness that made her eyes water a bit. Eddie’s room was a disaster zone. Rune papers lay scattered across the floor. Some with hastily drawn symbols, others crumpled up as if they’d been tossed in frustration. Books lay open, half-buried under empty potion vials. The small burner was still glowing from the last experiment he must have conducted.
And there, in the middle of this alchemical chaos, was Eddie. Sprawled out on his back. An arm covering his eyes, surrounded by scrolls. Like he’d just collapsed and decided the mess of his bed was good enough for a nap. Torrie tiptoed over and gave him a slight nudge with her hands.
“Eddie,“ she whispered sharply. “Mum says breakfast is ready.”
No response. He didn’t even flinch.
She nudged him harder. “Eddie, you’re going to miss breakfast!”
Still nothing. He looked completely wiped out. She could see faint circles under his eyes, hinting at his exhaustion. It was clear he’d probably worked himself to the bone over the last few weeks. With little sleep and barely any time at home. But that didn’t make her any less annoyed.
“Ugh, come on, Eddie!“ she huffed, folding her arms, and gave him one last, resolute shove.
“Get off, Torrie, leave me alone.“ He mumbled, shifting his direction to face the walls. He continues on lay there. Oblivious, dead to the world, still lost in the heavy sleep of someone who’d pushed himself too far.
Torrie scowled, crossing her arms. “Fine! Be that way,“ she muttered, half to herself. But, as she looked around at the scattered rune papers and potion bottles. An idea began to form—a mischievous little grin creeping across her face.
Torrie grabbed a half-full glass of water from Eddie’s cluttered desk. Her mischievous grin widened as she tiptoed back over to his sleeping form. She hesitated for a split second, then quickly dumped the cold water onto his face.
Eddie jolted up, sputtering. “Torrie—what—“ He wiped his face, blinking at her in shock. “You could’ve just woken me up normally, couldn’t you?”
Torrie shrugged, looking entirely too pleased with herself. “I did, but you wouldn’t budge. I knocked, called your name, everything!”
He groaned, glancing at the damp floor. “You didn’t have to soak me to get me up.“
“Well, it worked, didn’t it?“ she replied with a cheeky smile. “Mom said to eat breakfast,“ she added as she backed out of his room, turning to leave with a triumphant grin.
Eddie watched her disappear down the hall, shaking his head. Typical Torrie—always finding the most “creative“ ways to get her way.
o-
Eddie poked at his omelette absentmindedly. Glancing now and then at Torrie, who was happily munching on her fish and mashed potatoes. Mrs Welton noticed her son’s half-hearted bites and gave him a gentle nudge.
“So, how did it go?“ she asked, concern woven into her tone. “Your time with Catherine, the exam…”
Eddie sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Mentorship was... rough. Catherine went all out on me like it was life or death,“ he replied, a faint smile flickering. “Guess I should’ve expected that.”
Mrs Welton chuckled knowingly. “That sounds just like her. Catherine’s never been one to ease anyone into anything—especially her students. She was like that when she taught me magic, too.”
Torrie perked up, pausing mid-bite. “Wait, Catherine taught you too, Mom? But… how?”
Mrs Welton turned to Torrie, smiling as if she’d long waited for that question. “Well, Elves age differently, Torrie. Sure, they go through childhood, but at some point, they just... stop aging. Catherine looked just like she did now when I was a little girl, studying magic myself. And to this day, she still treats me like her younger sister, even if it seems the opposite now.“
“Doesn’t that get confusing?“ Torrie asked, eyes wide.
“A little.“ Mrs Welton laughed, giving Eddie a knowing look. “But Catherine’s heart is always in the right place. Her standards are just—well, impossibly high. It’s hard to be one of her students. But she teaches with the same passion she learned with… And how about the examination, Eddie? did you do well?“ Mrs Welton asked.
Eddie froze mid-motion, his fork hovering above his plate. He let out a slow breath, his shoulders slumping slightly as he searched for the right words. “Well… not a single bit of what Catherine taught me came up,“ he admitted. Shaking his head with lingering disbelief. “And the worst part? What I thought was the university entrance exam—it wasn’t. Turns out it was an Intermediate Proficiency test.“
“A proficiency test huh?“ Mrs Welton echoed, setting down her own fork, interest sparking in her gaze.
“Yeah,“ Eddie grumbled, leaning back in his chair. “The agent called Emma Somers set it up, apparently. It was way beyond what I was prepared for. Like someone wanted me to stumble right out of the gate.”
To Eddie’s surprise, his mother didn’t look shocked. In fact, the corners of her mouth tugged into an amused, knowing smile. A soft chuckle escaped her lips, and Eddie’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion.
“What?“ Eddie asked warily.
“Oh, Edward,“ Mrs Welton said. Her voice carries a mix of fondness and exasperation, “Would it surprise you to know that sounds exactly like Catherine’s handiwork?”
Eddie blinked, surprised. “What? Catherine? What are you talking about?”
Mrs Welton leaned forward slightly. Her expression teasing, but her words were steady, as though revealing an old secret. “Catherine’s always been the sort to challenge her students, not by giving them answers, but by throwing them into the deep end and watching them swim. She doesn’t care about whether you’re comfortable. She cares about whether you’re capable.”
Eddie frowned, the pieces slowly clicking together. “You mean…“
“Think about it,“ Mrs Welton continued, her eyes alight with the same glimmer Eddie had seen in Catherine’s. “If you’d been given a normal university entrance exam, you’d have known exactly what to expect. But Catherine? Oh, she’d never let you take the straightforward route. She probably saw the spark in you and whispered a few words to that agent, Mrs Somers.”
Eddie sat straighter, his fork forgotten on his plate. “You think she did this on purpose?“
“I don’t think—I know. I’ve been with her for seventeen years to consider her my sister.“ Mrs Welton said firmly. “Catherine doesn’t just teach students. She tests them in ways they don’t see coming. She pushes them to places where they have to think beyond the books, beyond what’s familiar. It’s her way of discovering what someone’s really made of.”
Eddie stared at his mother. The frustration he’d felt earlier gave way to something new. Something between awe and indignation. “So… she was trying to get me to do something impossible?“
“Or rather,“ Mrs Welton said, “She challenged you to think beyond the obvious.”
Eddie nodded, lost in thought, as he slowly chewed his food. “She is indeed one wicked elf.”
Mrs Welton chuckled again, clearly pleased by Eddie’s response. “She is indeed. But that’s what makes her such an excellent teacher. She doesn’t let you settle for the easy way out. So, how’d it go? Did you do well?”
His mouth felt dry as he fiddled with his fork, barely noticing that the rest of his breakfast had gone cold. “I don’t know, Mom,“ he muttered, looking down at his plate. “Maybe I went too far. I mean, I did give them that scroll instead of anything physical. And then when the examinee asked me, I… I got too cocky. I should’ve just kept my head down. What if they think I’m arrogant? What if they fail me because of that?“ His voice was distressed as he overanalyzed his every word and action from yesterday’s exam. “Maybe I messed up with how I responded to them.”
Torrie, who had been poking at her mashed potatoes, looked up with a mischievous grin. “Maybe you should learn to be a little more humble next time, Eddie,“ she teased, her voice playful.
Eddie shot her an incredulous look, his brow furrowing as his tone grew defensive. “What? It’s not like they didn’t challenge me first,“ he said, his voice rising with a slight hint of annoyance. “I’m not going to sit there and pretend to fail just to make them happy. If they want me to act all meek and proper, they should’ve just gone to Aella Academy!.”
Mrs Welton chuckled softly, a knowing smile curling at the corners of her mouth. “Oh, Eddie, always so ready to argue.“ She turned her gaze to Torrie, now snickering quietly at her older brother’s reaction. “You do know he gets that from you, right?“ she added to her younger daughter with a wink.
Clearly enjoying Eddie’s exasperation, Torrie just laughed and shook her head. “Maybe, but you should’ve seen how worked up he got over something as small as a comment. He looked like he was about to set the place on fire.“
“Look, I’m not that bad,“ Eddie grumbled, but his tone lacked the usual sharpness as he slouched back in his chair. The familiar banter between him and his family eased some of his nervousness.
As Eddie sat back, his thoughts drifted once again to the exam—that exam, the one where nothing had gone as planned. His memories were a tangled mess of scrawled diagrams, smudged transmutations, and that sinking feeling of failure that had followed him out of the examination hall.
He barely registered the sound of footsteps until his father’s steady voice broke through. “Eddie.”
Eddie looked up, startled. Mr Welton stepped into the kitchen, holding an envelope between his fingers. The man’s patient smile was faint but unmistakable. “You’ve got a letter. It’s from Edenfield.”
The words hit Eddie like a thunderclap. His first instinct was disbelief, an immediate rejection of what he’d just heard. From Edenfield? No. That wasn’t possible. It couldn’t be.
“What?“ The word slipped out of his mouth, half-breathless, almost hollow. His eyes narrowed as if trying to catch some trick in his father’s expression. “I beg your pardon?”
Mr. Welton extended the envelope. The cream-coloured paper caught the light, its corners pristine and sharp. And there, stamped in dark ink, was the Owl Emblem of Sage’s Academy and the Laurel Wreath of Edenfield University.
Eddie froze. His heart seemed to stop for a long, impossible moment before it lurched back to life, pounding hard in his chest. That emblem—the same one that had hovered in his dreams like some untouchable star—was staring him in the face.
“No,“ Eddie said quietly, shaking his head. He couldn’t look away from it, even as his thoughts swirled, each loud and clashing. “No, that can’t be right.“ He almost laughed, though it came out strained. “I—I messed up. The exam was awful. I didn’t—”
The words tangled in his throat. His father said nothing, only holding the letter out with quiet patience, his expression soft but unreadable.
Eddie swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry. For a second, he half-expected the envelope to disappear, for it all to be a cruel trick his mind was playing. Slowly—hesitantly—he reached out, his hand hovering just a moment before his fingers brushed the paper. It was real.
The silence in the room deepened, pressing around him, his pulse thundering in his ears. Eddie pulled the envelope closer, staring at his name scrawled in elegant ink across the front. His name. His address. It’s as though someone out there actually believed he belonged in Edenfield.
His throat tightened. Disbelief still warring with the tiny, trembling spark of hope flaring in his chest. “It’s… really from Edenfield?“ he whispered, more to himself than anyone else.
Torrie looked over from across the table, her eyes wide with anticipation. “Go on, Eddie, open it!“ she urged, a little too excitedly.
But Eddie’s hand hovered over the envelope, hesitating. “What if it’s… what if it’s a rejection?“ he muttered, almost to himself. He could already imagine the polite phrasing. The cold dismissal of his efforts and the distant words wished him “Good luck next time.“ He could hear Master Alchemist Magnus Borman’s voice telling him he’d failed. His stomach twisted at the thought, and he felt an uncomfortable lump in his throat.
Mrs Welton reached over, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Whatever it says, Eddie, you’ve come this far,“ she whispered, her voice reassuring. “No letter can take that from you.”
Eddie took a deep breath, his fingers finally closing around the envelope as he held it up. The official seals gleamed under the light, adding to the moment’s weight. He glanced at his family, who were all watching him with encouragement and curiosity, and, with one last steadying breath, he slowly tore it open.
Eddie’s fingers trembled as he carefully slid the delicate letter out of the envelope. The paper felt expensive and sturdy, and he noticed the intricate Elven embroidery along the edges. A shining Solivian pattern, as delicate as spider silk, printed in a glossy silver ink. He ran his fingers over the embossed texture, marvelling at its craftsmanship. This was no ordinary letter; it was a message from Edenfield, crafted with the utmost care.
Written in elegant cursive with even strokes, the text must have come from one of Isgardia’s renowned writing automatons. Eddie held his breath, his eyes scanning the first few lines.
“To Edward Welton of Weshaven,
In recognition of your application and recent performance during the assessment, we, the Faculty of Alchemy, hereby acknowledge the diligence and effort displayed. It has been noted that while your general knowledge of magic remains somewhat outdated, your performance in the field of alchemical theory has been nothing short of extraordinary. We were especially impressed by your depth of understanding in hypothetical transmutation and the innovative approach you applied to solve the impossible.“_
Eddie’s pulse quickened. He couldn’t quite read the tone—were they impressed enough to overlook his weaknesses? Torrie leaned over his shoulder, eyes wide as she followed the text.
“We recognise the unconventional nature of your submission and the courage it took to present an idea rather than a product, an exploration rather than a final result. This approach, though unorthodox, has shown a promising insight into the true nature of alchemical study, a quality highly valued within the hallowed halls of Edenfield University.“
Eddie’s heart was pounding. His throat felt dry as he read further. Still unsure—were they acknowledging his potential or merely giving him polite recognition before a formal rejection?
“Thus, the council of Faculty of Alchemy has reached a decision—”
Eddie paused, the words lingering in his mind like the cliff edge of a steep precipice. He could feel his mother’s gaze on him. Her encouragement was silent but palpable while Torrie held her breath beside him, barely containing her own anticipation.
Eddie’s eyes raced down the final lines of the letter. His breath hitched in his throat as the words finally came into complete focus.
“That, despite the unconventional nature of your submission, your efforts have not gone unnoticed. Your knowledge of alchemy proves extraordinary, and it is with great pleasure that we announce your acceptance into Edenfield University of Applied Magical Knowledge.“
Eddie’s mind buzzed, but the following sentence hit him like a thunderclap.
“The Faculty of Alchemy welcomes you with open arms.”
He stared at the signature beneath it, his gaze moving over the elegant cursive once, twice, to make sure it was real.
At the bottom of the letter were two names—one in flowing script, the other bold and authoritative:
Aelfric of Glyndorith, Wizard, Chancellor of Edenfield University
Magnus Borman, Master Alchemist, Head of Faculty of Alchemy, Edenfield University
It was real. Eddie could hardly believe it. He was staring at his future in that letter. Proof that everything he’d worked for, the countless sleepless nights, the gruelling test—everything—had led to this moment.
Eddie’s eyes widened, and it felt like time had stopped for a moment. He looked up at his mother, father, and then at Torrie, all equally stunned yet hopeful in how they stared at him.
For a moment, Eddie said nothing. He could feel his pulse thundering in his ears, the air suddenly too thick to breathe. Then, his mouth dry, he managed to stammer out,
“I’m in.“ His voice cracked, and he repeated it, louder this time, though still unsure if he fully believed it. “I got accepted to Edenfield.”
The room seemed to hold its breath before erupting. Mrs. Welton’s face softened into an expression of pride. Torrie, barely able to contain her excitement, jumped out of her seat and flung her arms around her older brother.
“You did it, Eddie! You really did it!“ Torrie’s voice was filled with disbelief and joy. Eddie could hardly hold back a grin as he hugged her back, feeling the weight of the past weeks of stress finally lift.
Mr Welton, his stern face breaking into a rare smile, clapped his hands together. “I knew you had it in you, Eddie. Well done.”
Mrs Welton’s eyes twinkled with pride. “Edenfield... This is just the beginning for you, my boy. You’ve made us proud.”
Eddie sat there, the letter still in his hands, unable to take it all in. It felt surreal, like some dream he hadn’t dared to hope for. He was going to Edenfield—he would become part of something bigger, something that would change everything.
Eddie allowed himself to relax for the first time in days, the overwhelming anxiety and uncertainty giving way to something else entirely: hope. 

-o-
Eddie sat on the edge of his bed, the warm glow of his bedside lamp casting a gentle light over his room. Outside, rain drummed softly against the window. Filling the night with a steady, soothing rhythm. He held the now-crinkled envelope from Edenfield University. Still in disbelief that its contents had changed his life just one morning.
His fingers brushed against a hidden weight as he turned the envelope over. Curious, he returned to the envelope and pulled out a second, more personal-looking letter. His brows knitted together as he carefully unfolded it. Recognising the neat script of Emma Somers.
He read quietly, the room settling into a hushed stillness as her words sank in:
&quot;Dear Edward,
First and foremost, congratulations on your acceptance to Edenfield University. You have earned it through merit, hard work, and courage. I am writing to tell you how genuinely pleased I am for you and to provide details for your departure to Edenfield next month. I hope you’re as ready for this journey as I know you will be.
I owe you an apology for the last few weeks. You’ve no doubt sensed my hesitation—my doubt, even. Know that it was never personal, only the weight of the expectations placed upon this institution. Yet you exceeded every challenge put before you, and I can confidently say you belong in Edenfield.
You will be assigned a place in the Sage’s Institute dormitory. A modest allowance will be provided to support you as you settle
I wish you all the best in what’s to come, and may this journey be everything you hope for. I believe you’ll find your way to greatness in the path that lies ahead._
With warm regards,
Emma Somers“
Eddie stared at the letter, a quiet pride settling as he read her words. He could feel a renewed determination stirring within him. This wasn’t just a new beginning but an acknowledgement of his efforts and worth. Her words held a weight he hadn’t expected, and for a moment, the self-doubt that had haunted him seemed to fade.
Eddie lay back on his bed, staring at the ceiling as memories washed over him. Each was like a page-turning in a story he’d only begun to understand. He thought of the long days spent poring over books with Catherine. The whispered doubts that had crept into his mind as he’d struggled to understand alchemical principles. The seemingly endless nights when he’d questioned if magic was even his path to follow. How many times had he stared into his potions and incantations? Feeling that, somehow, magic itself was just beyond his reach?
He could remember moments of frustration. Those days when the spells didn’t work, when his concoctions fizzled, when he felt like he was forcing something that didn’t belong to him. And yet, he could remember the joy when things did click. When he created something marvellous, even if small. But until today, he’d always wondered whether he deserved any of it.
Reading Emma’s letter, he felt a new sense of validation. Her faith in him felt like more than just an endorsement for Edenfield. It was the first solid proof that others saw in him what he’d so often struggled to see in himself. For the first time, he felt the quiet weight of the responsibility that came with magic—not a burden, but a privilege he had earned.
Closing Emma’s letter, Eddie took a deep breath, letting a feeling of calm settle over him. The journey ahead was daunting, yes, but he was also ready for it. Edenfield would be another chapter—a chance to discover the magic in the world and the strength within himself. He’d earned his place, and for the first time, he truly believed it.
The rain continued its soft murmur outside, and as Eddie drifted into sleep, a sense of peace filled him, as though all his past struggles had prepared him for the journey ahead.

            <Title>Chapter 7E V2</Title>
            <Text>The Archives hummed with a current of restless energy, the kind that made the hair on Eddie's arms stand on end. The usual sanctuary of whispered scholarship had transformed into a war council of desperation. Pages rustled not from study, but from nervous fingers. The scent of ink and parchment mingled with sweat and the metallic tang of fear.
Near the circulation desk, Ashley stood flanked by Campus Watch members, their armbands gleaming under the enchanted lanterns. Claire the librarian—usually so vibrant in her herbology lectures—leaned heavily against the desk, her olive skin gone ashen beneath purple eye bags. &quot;Just... don't damage anything,&quot; she murmured, fingers worrying at a moonflower pendant—Madeleine's birthday gift to her last semester.
Between the towering shelves, Catherine moved with the silent precision of a hunter tracking prey. Her fingers danced along leather-bound spines, pausing at intervals to extract volumes—Urban Hydrology of Edenfield, The Architectonics of Sewer Systems—each selection more ominous than the last. The lamplight caught the gold leaf lettering as she added another tome to her growing stack: The Necrotic Reckonings of Al'Marith.
Eddie caught glimpses of her through the gaps in the shelves, where she'd cornered two robed figures near the restricted section. The Alamirian scholars—Zenit and Nadir—stood like mirror images of concern, their identical olive complexions gone ashen under the library's sickly glow. Even from a distance, Eddie could see Nadir's hands trembling as he adjusted his wire-frame glasses, while Zenit's usually immaculate beard looked uncharacteristically unkempt.
From his vantage point, Eddie saw Catherine lean in close, her lips barely moving as she spoke. Whatever she said made both scholars go rigid, their eyes widening in something beyond fear—something closer to dread. Nadir made a warding sign Eddie recognized from old religious texts, the kind used against demons and dark magic.
Then, as if sensing Eddie's gaze, Catherine turned her head slightly. Her eyes—glowing faintly in the shadows like a cat's—locked onto his for one breathless moment before she deliberately turned back to the scholars, blocking his view with her body.
Christine and Geralt occupied a corner table, the heiress maintaining exact twelve inches of polished oak between herself and what she'd once dubbed &quot;the peasant brigade.&quot; Her perfectly manicured nails tapped an impatient rhythm, while Geralt's hulking frame made the antique chair creak ominously.
Eddie perched on a study table, Will beside him tuning his guitar with unnecessary force. The crowd before them was a mosaic of grief—first-years clutching stolen cafeteria knives, automaton engineers still smelling of solder and grease, parents whose work-roughened hands trembled around photos of missing children. Henry's automaton—a spider-like contraption of brass and envy—clicked nervously across tabletops, its lens focusing and refocusing on each speaker.
A man in dockworker's leathers stood abruptly, his chair screeching. &quot;They took my little sister after her night shift,&quot; he growled, knuckles whitening around a crumpled poster. &quot;The Watch said she probably ran off with some boy—&quot;
&quot;—like my son would abandon his scholarship!&quot; A woman in a merchant's shawl snapped. The jade comb in her hair—the exact shade Christine wore—marked her as Lucenvale gentry. &quot;That boy bled himself dry for his tuition!&quot;
The murmurs swelled into a roar. Will's guitar string snapped with a musical twang.
Eddie stood. The table trembled under his palms—or maybe that was his hands. He didn't shout. Didn't need to. The silence spread like spilled ink as seventy pairs of eyes locked onto him.
The archives had become a living thing—breathing in ragged anticipation, exhaling whispered fears. Eddie's pulse roared in his ears as faces turned toward him like flowers seeking the sun. A child's grubby fingers clutched a teddy bear missing one eye; the stitching reminded him horribly of Madeleine's crooked smile when she'd sewn his torn cloak last winter.
Will's elbow dug into his ribs. &quot;Alright, Eddie,&quot; he murmured, voice uncharacteristically soft. &quot;Time to step up.&quot;
Eddie's throat constricted. &quot;Who? Me?&quot; The words came out strangled.
&quot;Bloody hell, who else?&quot; Will's chuckle lacked its usual bravado. He gestured to the crowd—the automaton engineers with grease-stained shirts, the kitchen workers still in flour-dusted aprons, the Lucenvale matron clutching her jade comb like a talisman. &quot;You lit this fuse, mate. Now show them it wasn't just sparks.&quot;
Eddie's knees threatened to buckle as he stood. The sea of faces blurred—a first-year nervously thumbing the edge of a stolen letter opener, Claire the librarian's moonflower pendant catching the light, Catherine's feline smile from the philosophy stacks. His mouth moved soundlessly, hands trembling at his sides. The weight of their hope pressed down like the archives' ancient stone arches.
&quot;I—&quot; The word crumbled to dust on his tongue. He collapsed back onto the bench, wood screeching beneath him. &quot;I can't do this.&quot;
Ashley materialized at his side, her Campus Watch badge digging into his shoulder as she leaned close. &quot;Edward,&quot; she whispered, &quot;you convinced a room full of strangers to commit treason at midnight. You're already doing it.&quot;
Somewhere in the crowd, a baby began to cry—high and thin and terrified. Eddie closed his eyes. Saw Madeleine's face on that damned poster. Felt again the moment her fingers slipped from his grasp in the rain.
He stood so suddenly the table shuddered. This time when he raised his hand, the silence fell like an executioner's blade.
&quot;Alright.&quot; His voice didn't sound like his own. It sounded like the cracking of ice on the first thaw. &quot;Here's goes nothing.&quot;
Eddie's voice cut through the silence like a blade through parchment. &quot;Thank you all for coming.&quot; The tremor in his hands belied the steadiness of his words. &quot;We're here for the same reason—to drag our loved ones back from the Black Hand's shadows.&quot;
A ripple moved through the crowd—a woman with auburn hair still in her hospital scrubs clutched a photo to her chest. &quot;My brother,&quot; she whispered, the emergency room ID badge still clipped to her collar swinging gently. &quot;Vanished after his night shift at the docks. They said he probably drowned himself.&quot;
Across the room, a mountain of a man with tattooed knuckles slammed his fist onto a reading desk. &quot;My baby sister—top of her alchemy class.&quot; The tremor in his voice betrayed his hardened exterior. &quot;They told me she ran off with some boy. Like she'd ever leave her damn cat unfed.&quot;
Eddie felt their pain like physical blows. He straightened his spine, the motion sending dust motes swirling in the lamplight. &quot;We may be strangers,&quot; he said, &quot;but we share blood now—the blood the Black Hand has spilled.&quot; The words kindled something in the room, a heat that melted the frost of despair. &quot;And we will make them choke on it.&quot;
The change was instantaneous. Shoulders squared. Jaws set. Even Christine's perfectly manicured fingers curled into fists before she caught herself, her usual sneer faltering.
&quot;Today,&quot; Eddie continued, &quot;we're joined by Catherine the Wanderer.&quot; He gestured to the shadows where the elf leaned against a bookshelf, her wineglass catching the light. 



Eddie scanned the room, searching for a flicker of doubt, a hint of hesitation. But instead, he saw only a sea of resolute faces, each one etched with a unique story of loss, yet all bound together by a common purpose.
Taking a deep breath to steady his own nerves, Eddie addressed the room once more. &quot;We know this is a big ask,&quot; he acknowledged, his voice resonating with sincerity. &quot;We know this is a dangerous path we're about to embark on. But we can't do this alone. Every single one of you has a reason to fight. They've taken your loved ones, your friends, your family. But they haven't taken your spirit. They haven't taken your fight!&quot;
Silence once again descended upon the room. The students exchanged glances, their faces a mixture of fear and resolve. Then, a small, determined voice broke the tension.
&quot;I'm in,&quot; a young woman declared, her voice trembling slightly but her eyes blazing with defiance. &quot;I won't let them get away with this.&quot;
A wave of relief washed over Eddie. One voice had become two, then three, then a chorus. Christine, her face stoic but a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes, finally spoke. &quot;Fine,&quot; she conceded, a grudging acceptance in her voice. &quot;But let's get one thing clear – this alliance ends when we get Dominic back.&quot;
Geralt echoed her sentiment with a curt nod. &quot;We're here for Dominic. Nothing more.&quot;
Will, his eyes gleaming with newfound hope, added, &quot;And for Madeleine. And for everyone else they've taken.&quot;
Ashley looking Eddie with a smile latent with pride said, “We can do this. We have to.”
One by one, others echoed her sentiment. A ripple of agreement spread through the room, gathering momentum with each voice that joined the chorus. The fear hadn't vanished, but it was overshadowed by a fierce determination, a collective will to fight for justice.
&quot;We won't promise it will be easy,&quot; Eddie continued, his voice ringing with conviction. &quot;There will be challenges, dangers… But we will face them together. Because giving up is not an option. Not when our loved ones are counting on us to bring them home!&quot;
A collective cheer erupted from the crowd, a raw, primal sound that resonated with the pain and anger festering within them. This wasn't just a gathering anymore; it was the birth of a resistance, fueled by love and loss. Eddie glanced at Will and his bandmates, their faces alight with determination. He spotted Ashley next to him, a small smile playing on her lips as she watched the scene unfold. They had a long road ahead, but for the first time since Madeleine's disappearance, a flicker of hope danced in his heart. They weren't alone. They had an army. And together, they would find Madeleine and dismantle the Black Hand, one way or another. </Text>

            <Text>The deeper they ventured into Hallowmere, the more Edenfield’s scholarly charm peeled away, replaced by iron, soot, and the rhythmic groan of machinery. The streets narrowed, flanked on both sides by looming warehouses and factory walls blackened with decades of smoke. Overhead, pipes twisted like metal vines, releasing occasional bursts of steam that hissed into the night.
Train tracks ran along the main road, their rails vibrating faintly under the rumble of a passing locomotive. Carts clattered past, pulled by mechanical mules and piled high with barrels, crates, and sacks of glowing ore. The scent of oil and burning coal filled the air.
Will whistled. “Now this is my kind of place. Reminds me of home. Kinda.”
“You’re from Michigan,” Victoria said, side-stepping a suspicious puddle like it might reach up and grab her. “Is it... all like this there?”
“Nah,” Will smirked. “But the suburbs backed onto train yards and old factories. I used to sneak in with my cousins to play hide and seek. One of them broke an arm falling off a flour silo. Good times.”
Victoria made a faint gagging sound as they passed a butcher’s stall reeking of blood and brine. “I don’t know how anyone lives here. This place smells like regret.”
“Careful,” Ashley said, nudging her with a grin. “You’re describing about thirty percent of my childhood.”
Victoria sniffed, clearly trying not to breathe too deeply. “It’s just… so loud. And damp. And gray. Honestly, how do people focus with all this noise?”
Eddie, walking a step behind the others, gave her a sidelong glance. “You get used to it. Some people don’t have the luxury of choosing peace and quiet.”
“Oof,” Will muttered under his breath. “Critical hit.”
Madeleine stifled a smile but said nothing, her eyes scanning the alleyways as they walked.
“Besides,” Eddie added, “we’re not here for a sightseeing tour. We are here for Animal Garden.”</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 19 OLD</Title>
            <Text>The sudden sound of a gunshot shattered the stillness of the night. Echoing through the air like a crack of thunder. Eddie and Torrie froze, both stunned by the sharp, jarring noise. Eddie’s heart skipped a beat, but his face remained a mask of confusion. Torrie’s eyes widened, and she instinctively grabbed his arm. 

“What was that?” she asked, 

Eddie blinked, his thoughts distracted by the shot. “I don’t know,” he said, voice tight with concern. “It came from the direction Catherine and Markus went.” 

Torrie’s grip on his arm tightened, but Eddie brushed her off. He knew they could do nothing, but the sound gnawed at him—something was wrong. 

The air between them crackled with unresolved tension. Torrie seized the moment, her frustration bubbling over. “You’re seriously not going to say anything about it? You’ve just gone quiet again. Don’t you care?” 

Eddie, still processing the shot, struggled to find the right words. He opened his mouth, then closed it again, trying to make sense of everything. 

“Look, Torrie. It’s not that it doesn’t fascinate me,” Eddie said finally, his voice strained. “There’s just... nothing else to discuss. I don’t know what else to say about her.” 

Torrie’s expression shifted from frustration to something more accusatory. Her eyes narrowed. Her voice rose, barely containing the anger simmering beneath the surface. “You used to be so eager to meet Catherine. You’d spend hours talking about her, sharing everything you learned from her with me. Now, you act like she’s just another stranger. She noticed it, too—she was confused and disappointed by your reaction. Doesn’t that bother you?” 

Eddie’s face flushed, his patience wearing thin. He shook his head, frustrated by her insistence. “It’s not that simple. You don’t understand—” 

Torrie cut him off, her voice trembling with emotion. “Don’t I? You used to be passionate about magic, Eddie. You looked up to Catherine like she was some kind of hero. But now you’re just... a shell of your former self. You’ve completely shut down!” 

The accusation hung heavily in the air, and Eddie felt a pang of guilt. His hands clenched around the rifle, knuckles white. 

Torrie’s tears began to flow, her voice breaking with each word. “Don’t you feel bad for her, Ed? Magic used to be your life! You used to dream about it, and now you just act like it’s nothing. What happened to you? Just because you scarred a boy’s face during a duel doesn’t mean you should give it up!” 

Eddie’s face contorted with anger and pain. He stood up abruptly, his voice rising in frustration. “I didn’t just scar him, Torrie! I ruined his life. I didn’t just get expelled from the academy—I destroyed someone’s future, and I’ve done it countless times! Magic wasn’t just a hobby but a weapon, and I used it recklessly.” 

Torrie’s eyes widened in shock, her tears flowing freely now. “You’re just using that as an excuse! You’ve let one mistake define you. You’ve let it make you cold and distant. Aunt Catherine returned expecting to see the old you, full of wonder and ambition. Instead, she finds someone who’s given up on everything that used to matter.” 

Eddie’s voice cracked as he shouted back. “You think I wanted this? Do you think I wanted to become this person? It’s not just about one mistake—it’s about everything I lost because of it. I can’t just turn it back on like a switch.” 

The argument continued to escalate, their voices echoing off the surrounding trees. The once-gentle glow of the Eden Flowers seemed to flicker—more erratically this time—casting long, wavering shadows around them. The silent and watchful forest seemed to hold its breath as the siblings’ emotions spilt out. 

Torrie, flushed with anger and hurt, took a step back. “You’ve changed so much, Eddie. It’s like you’re not even the same person anymore.” 

Panting and shaken, Eddie looked at her with regret and defiance. “Maybe I’m not. Maybe I can’t be the person I was before. You don’t know what it’s like to live with the consequences of your actions.” 

For a moment, the forest seemed to close around them, the weight of their argument pressing down on both of them. The glow of the Luminas felt colder, and the distance between them seemed to widen with every harsh word. 

Torrie’s tears continued to flow, her voice a whisper of anguish. “I just... I wish you could see how much we still need that part of you, Eddie. The part that believed in magic believed in the good it could do.” </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 2E V2</Title>
            <Text>The bus groaned. It clanked beneath the floorboards like a piggy bank, accompanied by the rhythmic squeaking of the old suspension every time they hit a bump.
The seats creaked whenever someone shifted their weight. Somewhere near the back, a bolt was loose—it rattled faintly with every turn.
Overhead, the air conditioner wheezed out cool air in pitiful, uneven bursts. It clicked now and then, like it was trying to restart itself but kept giving up. 
The whole vehicle smelled faintly of dust and dried grass. 
Eddie sat near the window, his crutch propped beside him, fingers loosely gripping the handle. The metal of it was warm to the touch from sitting in the sunlight. His leg ached dully from the vibrations in the floor.
It was a week after his admission to Edenfield Infirmary, the nurses decided to let him go, since he looked more fine than ever, (and with Ashley and Will visiting too often, it gets really rowdy) and so he decided to leave and take his weekend somewhere.
Outside, the usual bustle of Edenfield is starting to give way to open fields. The noise of city life—the chatter of street vendors, the distant clanging of bells, the squeals of tram brakes—had long since faded, replaced by the subtle hum of wind brushing over fields.
He leaned against the cool windowpane and let his eyes drift to the hills outside.
The note crinkled faintly in his hand as he turned it over again.
21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground. Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.
Madeleine’s handwriting was neat, almost too neat—like every letter had been shaped with care.
He could’ve ignored it.
Midterms were over. Will was back to his stacks of books. Ashley had thrown herself into her advocacy group again, fighting for student protections and probably brewing some conspiracy after everything that happened to him.
He could’ve gone back to the Book Pirates, argued about the latest book they’d smuggled in from the restricted section. He’d even drafted a rant about the plot holes in The Alchemist’s Mirror.
And yet, here he was.
Why?
Because of a hunch? Because of that thing that chased him—crawling on all fours with arms too long and a face that didn’t look human?
Or maybe because of her.
He let out a slow breath and leaned his head against the window. The glass was warm.
She’d been patient with him. Even when she caught him that one time—slipping a book from the library.
Who was he kidding?
She was kind to everyone. That was just who she was.
Eddie looked outside again. The golden fields started to thin. In their place, narrow rivers carved winding paths through the land, glinting in the sunlight. Trees—tall, broad, and old—appeared more frequently now, rising from mossy rocks and thick underbrush. Their branches cast flickering shadows that danced across the windows as the bus rattled along the dirt path, it reminds him of home.
The road dipped and groaned under the weight of the vehicle. Somewhere beneath Eddie’s seat, a loose panel clattered like it might fall off. Still, he kept his eyes forward.
The bus finally creaked to a stop before a worn wooden cabin that sat nestled beneath a wide oak tree. A crooked sign swung gently in the breeze above the door.
Norwood Campgrounds.
Eddie looked at the paper again, unfolding it like he hadn’t memorized every inch of it.
21st Norwood Street, past the campground.
Right, this must be it.
With a grunt, he pressed a hand to the metal frame of the seat in front of him and hoisted himself up. His angle protested instantly.
“Stupid… thing,” Eddie cursed at his own leg, “Should’ve waited a few more days.”
The aisle felt narrower than usual. He shuffled past the rows of empty seats, his hand dragging along the backs of them for balance, his body swaying with the uneven ground beneath the bus.
Gravel crunched under his foot. The scent of pine hit him immediately—strong, earthy, and damp. Somewhere nearby, birds were chirping, and the wind whistled gently through the leaves like a whisper.
Eddie took a few slow steps forward, scanning the area. Past the bus stop and Norwood Campgrounds cabin, there wasn’t much—just a scattering of wooden buildings, most of them locked up, a picnic table or two, and a lonely clothesline swaying in the breeze. Beyond that, just trees. Trees and shadows. Tall and thick, the kind that swallowed noise and direction.
He turned the note over in his hand again.
“Past the campground,” it said.
Past where? Eddie thought. 
Eddie starting to limp his way around the camp grounds, asking any person that he can see walking close by, and nobody had given him a solid answer. One of them pointed down a trail that led nowhere, the other looked confused and said it didn’t exist at all. Ten minutes passed. Maybe fifteen. He was sweating now, leaning heavier on his crutch, irritation mounting.
He came to a slow stop by a large oak tree, breathing hard. His leg was sore, his shirt was sticking to his back, and he was starting to wonder if this had all been a mistake. Maybe Madeleine had been joking. Or testing him. Or maybe—
“Edward!”
The voice cut through the woods like a warm gust of air. He froze, eyes scanning the brush and the winding paths around him.
Again, “Edward!”
He turned just in time to see a figure emerging between two trees—wavy red hair catching the sunlight like a flicker of fire, arms waving above her head.
Madeleine.
She jogged toward him, boots thudding softly against the dirt path, a wide smile on her face.
“You made it!” she called, beaming.
Before he could say anything, Madeleine wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug.
“Agh—crap—my leg!” Eddie winced, half-laughing, half-wheezing.
Madeleine immediately pulled back, her eyes wide. “Oh no! I’m so sorry—I didn’t know you were still healing!”
He waved it off, trying to catch his breath. “No, no, it’s fine—just… It’s still there y’know?”
Madeleine frowned, looking genuinely guilty. “You should’ve waited a few more days. Seriously. You didn’t have to come limping through the woods for this.”
“What can I say, I couldn’t wait to see the dragons,” Eddie said dryly, expecting an eye-roll or a sarcastic jab in return.
Instead, Madeleine glanced ahead and replied, matter-of-factly, “They’re currently under intensive care. One of them had a wing injury and the hatchling’s still in containment, so I’m afraid you won’t be able to see them today.”
“Haha, yeah.” Eddie chuckled. Then paused. “Wait… you’re serious?”

-o-

The path they followed are narrow. Between rows upon rows of towering pine trees and giant rocks. The sunlight filtering through in golden slants. The silence of the woods was complete—except for the occasional chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves, and now and then, a distant, eerie wail from deeper in the forest.
“So…” Eddie opened, beginning to feel the silence, “How long have you been doing this? The Sanctuary thing.”
“Since my first year.” Her voice was calm, nostalgic. “I signed up as a volunteer the moment I arrived in Edenfield. But to be honest, it started long before that.”
“You grew up around these kind of stuff?”
“You could say that,” she said with a small laugh. “But not exactly, I was always obsessed with them. Reading about them. Drawing them. Pretending I had one hidden under my bed when I was little.” She slowed her pace a little, eyes scanning the path ahead. 
“There was one time,” She continued, “When I was maybe eight or nine—me and two of my best friends were playing by the creek near my place. We stumbled on this injured hatchling. Tiny thing. Could barely stand. It must’ve gotten separated from its flock.”
Eddie listened, the rhythmic thud of his crutch tapping the dirt between her words.
“We couldn’t tell our parents,” she continued. “They’d have made us give it up right away. Said it was too dangerous. So we took turns sneaking out food and blankets. One of us would always be on watch while the others fed it and tend to its wing.”
“It took almost a year.” She smiled, “But one day, it just stood up, flapped its wings, and took off. Just like that. No warning. No goodbye. He’s Just… gone.”
“Didn’t that… I don’t know… Hurt?” Eddie asked.
“What do you mean?” Madeleine asked back.
“I don’t know…” Eddie said, “Taking care of something for almost a year. You must’ve grown attached to that thing, you know?”
Madeleine shook her head. “Some people say letting go is painful. But I didn’t feel that way. It’s just that the feeling I felt finally seeing them fly again outweights the feeling I felt when they left. Seeing it soar… If felt as if we did something good, and that was enough.”
They walked in silence for a few more steps.
Eddie looked at her. “That’s a lot of heart for an eight-year-old.”
“I don’t think it was heart.” Madeleine smiled at him. “It was hope.”

-o-

They walked for some time, the path narrowing until it became little more than a trail of flattened leaves and twisted roots. Eventually, Madeleine veered off the track, motioning for Eddie to follow her. He hesitated for a moment, then sighed and limped after her into a quiet clearing surrounded by towering trees.
At the far end of the clearing stood two trees unlike any Eddie had seen before. They were impossibly tall, ancient, their gnarled trunks wide enough to fit a whole bus between them. Roots like thick ropes coiled at their bases, and their dark green canopies loomed high above the rest of the forest like silent sentinels.
Eddie stood in the middle of the clearing, taking in the sheer scale of them.
Madeleine, meanwhile, walked toward the space between the trees. She paced to and fro in front of them, scanning the area.
“What are you doing?” Eddie called.
Madeleine squinted at the ground, then up at the trunks. “Someone must’ve closed the gate.”
“The what?”
“Did you bring a wand?”
“I umm… no, I don’t have any.”
She winced. “Right. Of course, sorry I forgot you’re in Alchemy. I don’t have mine either.”
With a resigned sigh, Madeleine stepped up to one of the trees and began patting the bark, feeling around the grooves like someone searching for a hidden latch. After a few moments, she let out a soft “Ah-ha!” and pulled something free from a hollow in the bark.
It was a staff—twisted wood woven into a lattice, with a simple, clouded crystal embedded at the top. The whole thing looked as if it had grown that way.
Madeleine approached the first tree and tapped it once with the staff. Then she crossed over to the other and did the same.
Finally, she returned to Eddie’s side, held the staff upright, and brought its base down against the earth with a soft thunk.
At first, nothing happened.
Then, high above, something stirred.
Eddie looked up just in time to see a thick branch from one tree curl inward like a bending arm. The other tree responded in kind. The two branches reached across the empty space between them and interlocked, forming a curved archway of living wood.
And beneath that arch, the world changed.
Where moments ago there had only been trees and brambles, now stood an open expanse of green fields stretching gently toward the horizon. A wooden fence traced the edge of a nearby pasture, and beyond it were low cabins with mossy roofs, a few smoke trails curling lazily from chimneys. The scent of hay and something vaguely sulfurous wafted from the invisible threshold.
Eddie blinked. “That’s… new.”
Madeleine grinned. “Welcome to the Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.”

            <Title>Will and Ashley G2G</Title>
            <Text>“I’m just saying it’s a bad idea, Ash,” Will pleaded, his hands shoved deep into his pockets as if to keep them from flailing in frustration. He stood a step below her, his brow furrowed with genuine worry. “Going to a rally for a group called ‘The Rightful King Movement’? It sounds… aggressively unstable. And for what? You don’t have any proof of wrongdoing.”
Ashley, perched casually on the railing as if it were a park bench, gave him a dazzling smile. “Proof? Willy, come on, I don’t need prof. The group literally got a bad vibe!”
She swung her legs, kicking her heels against the metal baluster with a rhythmic tink, tink, tink.
Will’s shoulders sagged. “Your vibe, Mayfair. Is not an actionable intelligence! This isn’t some game. These are political extremists. They don't like outsiders, especially not some pokey students sticking their noses where they don't belong. You could get hurt. Or arrested. Or both!”
Eddie, who had been observing the exchange like a slow-motion magic duel, finally spoke up, pushing himself off the wall. “Will’s not wrong, Ash. A little planning wouldn’t kill us.”
Ashley winked at him. “What’s to plan? We go, we watch, we listen. C’mon, Eddie, back me up here.” She nudged him with her foot.
“I already said I’m going with you,” Eddie sighed, a long-suffering sound he’d perfected over years of friendship with her. “That doesn’t mean I think it’s a smart thing to do. It just means I know you’ll go anyway, and I’d rather be there to pull you out in case you screwed up.”
“See, Will?” Ashley beamed, spreading her arms wide. “I’ll have my very own knight in shining issued armor! We’ll be perfectly safe.”
“That wasn’t a compliment, Ash. I’m just trying to keep you alive at least until graduation,” Eddie quipped.
“Hey, come on! But at least you’re supporting me on this!” Ashley shot back.
“Ashley, please.” Will took a step up, his voice dropping to a near whisper, desperate for her to understand. “Just think about it for a second. Logically. What is the best-case scenario? You find nothing, and you’ve risked yourselves for no reason. What’s the worst-case? Your ‘bad vibes’ is real, and you walk right into the middle of it with no allies other than Eddie, and no escape plan.”
For a moment, Ashley stopped kicking. She looked at Will, her expression softening just a fraction. But instead of conceding, she hopped off the railing and patted his cheek.
“You worry too much. It gives you wrinkles,” she said breezily. “Look, someone has to go poke the scary bear with a stick. Better it’s me, who can at least talk my way out of a cursed crypt, than some poor dude who can’t. It’ll be an adventure!”
“No.”
The word was quiet, but it landed in the small space with the weight of a dropped stone. Will wasn't pleading anymore. His expression was set, his arms crossed. It was a look of absolute finality. “We’re not doing it. It’s too reckless.”
Ashley threw her head back and groaned, a loud, theatrical sound of pure frustration. She spotted a crumpled hoodie lying near the base of the stairs and gave it a satisfying kick, sending it skittering into the dark corner. 
&quot;Unbelievable! Eddie,&quot; she stage-whispered, hooking a thumb towards the nearest grime-streaked window. &quot;How about you give me a boost? What he doesn't know won't hurt him.&quot;
Eddie winced, shaking his head. “You know I can’t, Ashley. Rules are rules. The three of us have to agree before we do something this risky and stupid. It’s the only reason we haven’t been expelled, arrested, or maybe killed.”
“Ugh!” Ashley groaned again, turning on Will, her frustration now bubbling over into amusing annoyance. “What is with you lately? Seriously, Will. First, you vetoed my plan to investigate the Whispering Caverns—which, by the way, totally had some cool views and singing sirens, and now this! It’s like you’ve become the official president of the ‘Let’s Keep Ashley Wrapped in Cotton Wool’ club.”
“Look, Ashley.” Will sighed, “That wasn’t my intention-“ 
“Is it?” Ashley pouted, “Are you this worried about Eddie when he wants to go test some new transmutation formula that can explode? No. Do you fret this much when you stay up all night trying to animate a golem that could potentially pommel you with their fist? Of course not. It’s just me! Honestly, the way you carry on, you sound like…” she paused, a mischievous glint in her eye as she found the perfect, most ridiculous jab, “You sound like you have a crush on me or something.”
She said it off-handedly, with a laugh in her voice, another silly tease in a long history of them. It was meant to be absurd, to poke fun at his overprotective nature.
Silence.
Will’s jaw was tight, his gaze fixed on the floor. The air crackled, suddenly charged with a new, unfamiliar tension.
Then, uncharacteristically, his head snapped up, his eyes locking onto hers, raw and startlingly intense.
“What if I do?!”
The words, sharp and full of a desperate energy she’d never heard from him before, echoed in the stairwell. Eddie froze mid-breath, his eyes wide. The playful smirk vanished from Ashley’s face, replaced by a look of pure, unadulterated shock. The world seemed to tilt on its axis, the teasing game vanishing in an instant, leaving only the stunning, impossible weight of his confession hanging in the air between them.
She forced a shaky laugh, a pale imitation of her usual breezy confidence. &quot;Pfft, yeah right,&quot; she deflected, giving him a light shove. &quot;If you did, you wouldn't be this close, dummy! You'd be a blushing mess ten feet away!&quot;
It was the perfect bait, an easy return to their normal banter. But Will didn't take it. He didn't even flinch. He just stood there, his jaw tight, his gaze unwavering and painfully sincere. He remained silent, letting her joke fall flat and die in the tense air between them.
And in that silence, her playful smile dissolved, her eyes widening as the truth crashed into her. He wasn't joking. He wasn't teasing her back. He was serious.
“Wait…” she breathed, the word barely a whisper. “You’re serious.” Her gaze searched his face, seeing past the years of friendship to the hidden vulnerability he’d just laid bare. “Since when?”
Will finally broke eye contact, his gaze dropping to the floor as a faint flush crept up his neck. He looked deeply embarrassed, as if regretting the words the moment they’d left his mouth. He mumbled his answer, so brief and quiet she almost missed it.
“The Midnight Library Raid.”
The memory was instant: the three of them sneaking through moonlit corridors, the smell of old parchment, the shared thrill of breaking the rules for a simple paper citation. It felt like a lifetime ago. Before she could process it, another voice cut through the tension.
Perched on a large, sturdy cupboard against the wall, Eddie cleared his throat awkwardly. He’d been watching the entire exchange, forgotten by the other two. 
“So… are we still going?” he asked, his voice sounding unnaturally loud in the charged atmosphere.
“Um… no.” Ashley answered immediately, a blush blooming across her cheeks. She couldn’t look at Will, couldn’t look at Eddie. She suddenly felt incredibly exposed. “C-can you give us a moment, Ed? We’re not going.”
“O-okay then,” Eddie said, sliding carefully off the cupboard. He gave them a wide berth as he walked towards the heavy door leading to the boy’s dormitory hall. He paused, looking back at them one last time.
From the doorway, he could see their two figures silhouetted against the pale moonlight filtering through the stairwell window. They were just standing there, a foot of charged space between them, impossibly still. A part of him, the part that knew how long and how deeply Will had hidden this, felt a surge of happiness for his friend. He’d finally said it.
But a cold knot of worry tightened in his stomach. He knew them. He knew the delicate, chaotic balance of their friendship. What if Ashley didn’t feel the same way? Would this shatter the easy camaraderie they all shared? Would they still be Will, Ashley, and Eddie? Or would this confession be the beginning of the end? With a final, worried glance, Eddie pulled the door shut, leaving the two of them alone in the moonlight.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 23 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Eddie knelt beside Catherine, his fingers trembling as he shook her shoulders again. No response. She remained limp, her breathing shallow.
His stomach twisted. Damn it. She isn’t waking up.
And then… A shadow loomed over him.
Eddie’s breath stopped as he looked up.
The Nightingale Dragon made its way through the smoke, its monstrous form wreathed in fire. Its obsidian-black scales glistened like molten glass, reflecting the flickering embers that floated through the air. And then, through the shifting haze, Eddie saw them—
Five glowing red eyes. His pulse pounded in his ears. He had shot one of those eyes. Destroyed it. But now…
The ruined eye twitched.
A sickening squelch could be heard in the middle of the hearth.
The shattered socket bulged, raw flesh writhing like something alive. The jagged ball of lead he had fired into it slid loose, falling to the ground with a hollow clink, discarded like a worthless pebble. Echoing through the ruins.
Before his very eyes, a new eye pushed its way into place—larger, grotesque, its veins pulsing with a deep, hellish red glow.
Eddie’s breath caught..
This thing… it regenerates.
A cold, primal fear sank its claws into his chest.
His gaze darted to his surroundings—his rifle lay in splinters, shattered beyond repair. Catherine’s staff was broken, its elegant wood snapped in two.
They had nothing.
His fingers curled into fists.
His thumb brushed over the smooth surface of his jade ring.
His heart slowed as he realised one thing… He was never unarmed.
Eddie closed his eyes. Took a breath.
I was an Alchemist, he thought.
Then, he stood… The dragon’s eyes narrowed.
No… He straightened his back, shoulders squaring.
I am an Alchemist… I always was.
His jade ring began to glow.
From his outstretched hand, a luminous transmutation circle flared to life. Radiant, intricate, lines of emerald light spiraling outward.
The dragon growled—a deep, guttural sound like stone grinding against stone.
Eddie met its gaze.
His hands clenched around the metal and powder.
He stepped forward.

-o-

The Nightingale Dragon loomed, its jagged silhouette framed by the flickering glow of distant fires. Its five glowing eyes followed Eddie’s every movement, but it did not strike. It was waiting.
Eddie stepped forward.
The dragon did not move.
He took another step.
Then another.
His walk quickened.
The dragon’s massive chest expanded, its ribcage stretching outward, a deep, hollow rumble growing from within.
Frost began to creep across its obsidian-black scales, and the air turned bitterly cold.
It’s inhaling.
Eddie’s jog turned into a sprint.
The dragon’s throat glowed pale blue, veins of freezing energy pulsing beneath its skin.
Eddie gritted his teeth.
The dragon reared its head back.
Eddie charged forward.
The dragon roared.
Then—
A howling burst of frost exploded from the creature’s maw.
A blizzard of pure ice erupted into the ruins, freezing the stone in an instant. The ground cracked and shattered under the pressure of sudden frost, jagged spires of ice erupting from every surface.
The temperature plummeted.
But Eddie was already moving.
His hands flashed, his jade ring blazing with light.
Fog. Mist. Vapour.
Eddie reached out with his Alchemy, grabbing hold of the lingering heat in the air. He twisted it, shaped it, forced it into motion.
The haze around him thickened—white mist roiled like a living thing, swirling into a barrier before him.
Then, as the dragon’s icy breath struck—
The mist ignited.
A wall of vapour surged upward, transforming into a protective shield of heated air.
The freezing blizzard collided with the barrier.
A deafening hiss filled the ruins.
The ice breath, meant to turn him to frost, was instead redirected.
Shards of frost and spikes of ice were hurled skyward, bursting apart as the conflicting temperatures clashed.
The dragon’s breath roared against Eddie’s alchemy.
For a moment, the two forces struggled—cold versus heat, frost against vapour—
And then, with a final violent burst, the last of the dragon’s freezing breath was sent spiraling harmlessly into the air.
Eddie’s heart pounded as he reached into his satchel. His fingers brushed against the familiar weight of metal balls and pouches of gunpowder.
Fire.
Catherine had figured it out… The dragon’s weakness was fire.
His jade ring pulsed, and the transmutation circle flared back to life, glowing like molten gold across his palm.
With a sharp inhale, Eddie grabbed a handful of gunpowder and metal spheres, his mind racing through the process.
Metal. Powder. Ignition. Acceleration.
He thrust his hand forward.
The gunpowder ignited instantly, his Alchemy heating it in an instant. The metal balls caught fire, burning a brilliant golden-red as they were launched forward… Fireballs.
The first shot collided with the dragon’s side. The impact sent a shockwave through the air, a small explosion erupting against its scales. The heat licked across its obsidian-like hide, cracking the surface.
The dragon roared in fury, Eddie hurled another.
And another.
Each strike chipped away at its thick armor, sending fragments of darkened scale crumbling to the ground. Beneath the cracked shell, raw, glowing flesh was exposed—scorched, vulnerable.
The dragon staggered back, its remaining five eyes flashing with pain.
The dragon lowered its stance, muscles tensing as if preparing to strike. Its massive claws ripped through the stone beneath it, the entire ruin shaking under its weight.
Eddie took a sharp breath. His hands shook as he reached into his satchel. 
This is it. His final shot.
He ripped open the remaining pouches of gunpowder, the fine black grains spilling into his palms. The last metal spheres glinted in the dim, flickering firelight.
His jade ring pulsed brighter than ever, and the air around him crackled with raw energy.
The transmutation circle expanded across the ground beneath him, glowing white-hot.
Eddie thrust his hands forward.
The metal ignited. The powder combusted.
And then—
The sky exploded.
A torrent of fireballs burst into the air, like a meteor shower turned against the dragon.
Fiery hailstorm rained down, striking the dragon’s massive frame over and over. Scorching heat seared through the cracks in its scales, ripping apart its armored hide.
The Nightingale Dragon roared—a deafening, agonized cry.
It staggered back.
A final, devastating explosion sent it crashing into the side of a ruined structure. The ancient stone gave way, collapsing beneath the beast’s enormous weight.
The ruins shook. A thunderous crash rang out as the dragon was buried beneath the rubble.
For a long, breathless moment, there was only silence.
Then—
A gust of wind.
Rubble shifted. The dragon emerged, its body battered and smoldering.
It let out a low, guttural snarl, its five glowing eyes narrowing at Eddie. But it did not lunge.
Instead… It spread its enormous wings.
A single powerful beat sent dust and debris spiraling into the air.
The beast lurched backward. Slowly at first, then faster, rising higher and higher into the deep night sky.
Eddie shielded his eyes as the Nightingale Dragon gave one final, piercing shriek—
And then, with a final flap of its wings, it was gone.
The ruins fell still.</Text>

            <Text>ACT 1

I am disillusioned with Alchemy because I accidentally hurt someone with it

Alchemy is who I am, I might have made mistake with it, but that doesn’t define me, nor the concept of Alchemy.


ACT 2

I am an Alchemist and I am passionate about Alchemy, and learning other form of magics.

Alchemy turns out can be used for evil, and has been used for evil. (All is lost)

What defines an Alchemist is the Alchemist himself, and not Alchemy in general (DNOTS)

I am a good Alchemist (Revival)



ACT 3

An Evil Alchemist has risen, and he is going to do some bad things.

Because I am a Good Alchemist, it is my duty to face him

Evil has power, while Good has moral and knowledge, and I use it against him

Evil has been conquered, which means, Alchemy is not defined by the subject itself, but the Alchemist

I am a Good Alchemist

            <Title>Chapter 25 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>Eddie and Catherine trudged through the shattered remnants of the Illusory Forest, the path barely recognizable beneath the rubble. The trees loomed around them, casting long, jagged shadows over the uneven ground, their shapes twisting in the dim light.
Catherine walked beside him, clutching the splintered remains of her once-proud brass mahogany staff. The delicate engravings that had once gleamed with alchemical precision were now marred by cracks and soot, hastily mended by Alchemical Mending.
Eddie’s rifle—his father’s rifle—lay in two broken halves, its finely crafted compartments torn apart. Every step pressed the weight of the battle deeper into his chest.
Catherine’s alchemy-infused salves had eased some of his pain, but the bruises, burns, and sharp, unnatural angle of his arm were beyond simple remedies. He barely winced but held it close, as if acknowledging the injury would make it worse.
His entire body ached, a dull, persistent throb that had settled into his bones. His limbs felt leaden, his breaths shallow. The forest around him felt distant—like he was walking through a dream, his senses dulled at the edges.
But he refused to slow down. 
The night stretched on, the forest shifting around them. Quiet. Too quiet.
Catherine finally spoke, her voice hesitant, breaking the fragile silence.
“Say, Edward,” She began, “Have you heard about the History of Nocturnilus the Conqueror?”
“The Elven Emperor?” Eddie asked back,
“Yeah,”
“What of it?”
Catherine stayed silent, then continued, 
&quot;There have been sorcerers who toppled kingdoms, enslaved millions, and committed atrocities beyond imagination.&quot;
She let that sink in before continuing.
&quot;Once, he was just a spellcraftsman millenias ago—a sorcerer in service to the Northern Elven Kingdom. The elves have always lived by magic. For us, it was a gift, a birthright, a force of creation.&quot;
Her voice darkened.
&quot;But for Nocturnilus, it was never enough.&quot;
She glanced at the treetops, as if searching for memories carved into the night sky.
&quot;Blinded by greed, by the hunger for more, he turned his power toward conquest. He was the first sorcerer to raise a city of stone with a mere gesture—and the first to reduce one to ash just as easily. He marched across the lands, toppling kings, razing kingdoms, and forging an empire from the ruins of others.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the earlier pain still pressing against his chest.
&quot;His armies enslaved millions, binding them with chains wrought from his own magic. He thought himself invincible.&quot;
Catherine’s voice dropped lower, almost a whisper. &quot;But the more he took, the more magic consumed him. It changed him. His flesh, his mind… his very soul. By the end, he was no longer a man. Some say he was no longer even an elf. Just a shadow, a being twisted by his own power.&quot;
&quot;And there was Aeron the Founder… One of the nine sages.&quot;
The name lingered between them like a spark in the cold night air.
&quot;He was an elf, like Nocturnilus. In fact, he once served under him—stood at his side as a fellow conjurer, weaving spells to expand Nocturnilus’s empire. For years, he followed orders, watching cities crumble, watching people enslaved by the very magic that was meant to enrich elven lives.&quot;
Catherine’s voice grew firm. &quot;But then, something changed. Aeron looked at the ruins they had left behind, at the lives shattered by conquest, and he could no longer bear it. He chose to walk away.&quot;
Eddie frowned. &quot;He just… left?&quot;
&quot;Not just left,&quot; Catherine corrected. &quot;He rebelled. He turned against the empire he had once helped build. He traveled to the very lands he had once helped destroy—not as a conqueror, but as a healer. A teacher.”
“He taught magic to those who feared it, gave power to those who had none. And in the end, it was his students, his disciples, the very people Nocturnilus had enslaved, who brought the tyrant down to his knees.&quot;
Eddie swallowed, the weight of her words settling in his chest.
&quot;Aeron could have followed the same path,&quot; Catherine continued, &quot;But he chose differently. He eventually founded and became one of the Nine Sages, the very founders of the magical world as we know it.”
“He and the others built cities where there was only wasteland, cured diseases that once ravaged nations, opened doors to possibilities no one had dared to dream of before.&quot;
Eddie’s fingers twitched at his sides. His thoughts churned, Catherine’s words fighting against years of self-doubt.
Catherine didn’t hesitate. She placed a hand on his shoulder, firm and reassuring.
&quot;It’s not about what magic can do,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s about what you can to do with it.&quot;
The weight of her words settled in his chest, pressing against the scars he had buried deep.
For a moment, neither of them spoke. The night stretched quiet and still around them
His thoughts swirled, heavy as the night pressing in around them. The conversation lingered in his mind, every word, every confession.
But it wasn’t just his own past haunting him now. It was the stories Catherine had told him—the truth behind history.
Nocturnilus, the Elven Emperor who razed nations in conquest.
Aeron Consurion, the Founding Sage who shaped the magical world anew.
Both had walked this very path.
Both had wielded the same magic.
One was a tyrant.
One was a pioneer.
The history books painted them in stark contrast—opposites in morality, in purpose. Two figures who should never have shared the same road.
And yet… they had.
So what did that make him?
His vision blurred at the edges. His body felt heavier, like something was pressing down on him, urging him to stop. His head pounded, a dull, rhythmic ache that made the trees around him sway slightly.
His grip tightened around the rifle, but his fingers felt numb.
He walked.
And walked.
And walked.
The trees thinned, shadows giving way to the open road. And through the haze of exhaustion, he saw them.
Markus stood ahead, arms crossed, his sharp eyes scanning the darkness, pacing slightly.
Torrie, wrapped in her yellow knit sweater, bounced anxiously on her heels, her twin tails swaying as she strained to see down the path.
His best friend.
His sister.
They were waiting for him.
Eddie took a step toward them—
His knees buckled.
The world lurched sideways. The earth tilted, a sudden, violent pull that yanked his stomach down with it.
He barely registered the shouts—Catherine’s startled gasp, the panicked voices ahead—before the ground rose up to meet him.
Darkness swallowed him whole.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5</Title>
            <Text>The warm scent of crushed herbs and dried roots filled the apothecary.
Mrs. Welton stood over the stovetop in her small corner kitchen, carefully stirring a simmering pot of golden liquid. The steam curled upward, laced with chamomile, turmeric, and a whisper of dried lavender. Her mortar and pestle sat nearby, still dusted with powdered ginger and licorice root.
It was a quiet morning, just the way she liked it. Sunlight filtered through the gauzy curtains above the sink, painting soft rectangles on the tiled floor.
She ladled the finished batch into small brown glass bottles, wiping each one clean before lining them up neatly on the wooden shelf beside the spice rack. The labels were handwritten—“Cough &amp; Cold Blend,” “Nerve Soother,” “Sleep Tonic”—and she hummed softly as she arranged them. A part of her took pride in this quiet routine. Always had.
Most of her real work was in prescriptions, of course—modern potions and compounds dispensed from Welton’s Apothecary. But in the quiet hours, she still practiced the old ways, brewing traditional remedies for the neighbors who asked for them. Remedies that weren’t always scientific, but comforting.
Once everything was cooled and sealed, she wiped her hands on her apron and stepped out into the dining area. The paper was folded on the table, waiting for her. She sank into the chair with a small sigh and reached for her tea, still steaming.
The news today was as dull as ever. Council debates. Rising fish prices. An article on some promising student from Canterbury who got into Cambridge.
The bell over the shop door chimed.
Mrs. Welton looked up, setting the paper aside. “Come in, love,” she called warmly. “I just brewed a fresh batch if you’re here for the usual.”
A regular—a young mother from down the road—stepped in with a sheepish smile. “You’re a lifesaver, Mrs. Welton. Jamie’s caught that awful cough again.”
Mrs. Welton stood, already reaching for a bottle. “Say no more, dear. Let’s get him sorted.”
And just like that, the rhythm of her day continued—quiet, steady, filled with warmth and herbs and small kindnesses.
The bell over the shop door chimed again.
Mrs. Welton glanced up from her paper, expecting another neighbor in search of remedies. It had been that kind of day—quiet, steady, interrupted only by the occasional customer with a sniffle or sleeplessness.
The bell rang again not long after, and again she rose, her movements practiced and unhurried. Another remedy here, a friendly chat there. Nothing out of the ordinary.
And then, at last, the bell rang a fourth time.
She looked up—this time, pausing.
It was Eddie.
He stepped inside with an odd look about him. Tense shoulders. Fidgeting fingers. His satchel hung awkwardly from one arm. Something was off.
Mrs. Welton stood. “Eddie? What’s wrong, love? And why didn’t you come through the back door?”
“I... I need to talk to you about something.”
There was a pause. She noted the way he wasn’t meeting her eyes.
“All right,” she said gently, stepping closer. “What happened?”
Eddie glanced around the shop, then lowered his voice. “Do you remember Edenfield University?”
Mrs. Welton blinked. Her brow creased. “Of course I do.”
“I signed up for their scholarship intake,” he said, half-defensive, half-uncertain. “Since you were an alum, I was hoping you could tell me something—anything—about it. There’s no record online. Nothing in the public library. It’s like it doesn’t exist.”
For a second, Mrs. Welton didn’t respond.
Then her eyes widened—just slightly. Her expression changed, not to surprise exactly, but recognition. And something else beneath it. A quiet seriousness Eddie had never seen in her before.
She walked briskly toward the shopfront.
Eddie watched as she flipped the wooden sign hanging in the front window from Open to Closed.
She turned the bolt on the door, then looked back at him.
“All right,” she said. “Sit down. We’re going to talk.”

-o-
The clink of ceramic cups was the only sound in the room for a while.
They sat at the small dining table tucked behind the storefront, the lights dimmed low as the late morning sun filtered through the drawn curtains. Mrs. Welton poured two cups—Eddie’s usual lavender blend, pale and fragrant; her own chamomile, warm and golden.
Eddie sat quietly, hands wrapped around his mug, watching the steam curl toward the ceiling. He could hear the faint ticking of the old clock on the wall.
Eddie hesitated for a moment, then asked, “Wait… did you study literature there? At Edenfield?”
Mrs. Welton let out a breathy laugh, more amused than surprised. “No, no. I told you that to keep things simple. Edenfield doesn’t even have a literature program.”
Eddie furrowed his brow. “Then… what did you study?”
She looked at him with a quiet, amused glint in her eyes. “Something more... unorthodox.”
There was a pause as she picked up her tea, then set it back down.
“Say… Eddie,” she said, her tone shifting, soft and deliberate. “Do you believe in magic?”
Eddie blinked. “No.”
His answer came out quickly, reflexively. The kind of “no” built from science textbooks, exams, and a life surrounded by machinery and practical knowledge. He looked at her as if expecting the punchline to a joke.
But she didn’t laugh. Instead, she reached into the pocket of her skirt and pulled out something long and thin, wrapped in a handkerchief.
She unwrapped it carefully, reverently.
It was a wand. A smooth, dark piece of wood, carved with small symbols along its length—symbols that seemed to shimmer faintly in the dim kitchen light.
Eddie leaned forward. “What… is that?”
Mrs. Welton didn’t answer right away. She reached forward, her hand steady as ever, and pointed her wand toward the sugar jar sitting across the room on the kitchen counter.
Then, she whispered something—soft and strange, like a language Eddie couldn’t place. The air around the wand seemed to hum, just for a second.
In the blink of an eye, the sugar jar vanished.
Eddie straightened, startled. “Wait—”
Before he could finish, the jar reappeared right in front of them on the table, perfectly intact, as though it had always been there.
Eddie’s mouth opened slightly. He hadn’t seen it move. Hadn’t seen anything move.
It just… happened.
Mrs. Welton watched him with quiet amusement.
“That,” she said, “is what I truly studied in my younger years.”
She tapped her wand gently against the table.
“Illusions,” she said. “A branch of magic, taught at the Edenfield University of Applied Magical Knowledge.”
“So umm…” he began, his voice uncertain, “What is Edenfield, anyway? Where is it exactly?”
Mrs. Welton didn’t answer at first. She stared into her tea for a long moment, then set the cup down gently.
“It’s… hard to explain,” she said at last. “It’s not in any place we know of.”
Eddie blinked. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
She gave him a look. The kind she used to give him as a child when he asked about things that couldn’t be found in books. “I mean it exactly as I said it. It’s not on any map you’ll find in the library. Or online. Or on Earth as most know it.”
Eddie frowned, trying to decipher if this was another one of her metaphors. She always had a way of speaking like an old storybook—full of riddles and wrapped meanings. He’d always chalked it up to her being a literature major, quoting obscure poets or dramatists.
Eddie shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
She leaned back, folding her hands. “Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean—somewhere between Australia and South America—there used to be a continent. A massive landmass. It’s not on any map now, because it sank. Long ago. During an event scholars once called the Shifting. An earthquake, or something like it. The continent is gone now. Submerged.”
“What… continent?” Eddie asked slowly.
She looked him in the eye. “The Greater Archaean Archipelago.”
He stared at her.
“Why are you telling me this?”
She sipped her tea before answering. “Because that’s where Edenfield is. Or was. Or… still is, in a way.”
“That makes no sense.”
“No,” she agreed softly. “It doesn’t. That’s the thing. Edenfield doesn’t exist because it isn’t supposed to. But it does. Somehow.”
The air in the room felt heavier. Eddie’s mind spun with the impossibility of it. He looked down at his tea. At the steam rising and fading into nothing.
“But then… how did you get there?” he asked.
Mrs. Welton only smiled, eyes distant. “That, Eddie, is a story of its own. You’re not ready for that yet.”

            <Title>Chapter 8E</Title>
            <Text>The familiar bustle of Edenfield University pulsed around Eddie, but it barely registered. His eyes were sharp, fixed, alive with fury and purpose. In his hands, a thick stack of “Missing Person” flyers, each one bearing Madeleine’s smile, her name, and the date she vanished.
She was still out there. He could feel it in his bones. And he wasn’t going to let her stay missing.
Will walked beside him, quieter, eyes scanning the crowd as if Madeleine might emerge from it any second. But it was Eddie who moved like a storm waiting to break—his stride clipped, his jaw clenched, his every motion carried with it the weight of a vow.
With every poster he plastered to a pole, a wall, a gate, it was more than paper and tape—it was a promise. Madeleine was not forgotten. She would not become just another name in a file cabinet collecting dust in the police archives.
People stared as they passed—some with curiosity, some with pity, some with guilt. Eddie didn’t care. Let them look. Let them see the fire in his eyes.
He pressed another flyer onto a weathered campus bulletin board, smoothing it flat with his palm. Her face stared back at him—smiling, bright, alive.

Eddie sank onto a weathered bench just outside the library, the sun dipping low behind the university spires, casting long amber shadows across the cobblestones. Beside him sat a half-empty bucket of glue, its rim crusted with dried paste, and a battered cardboard box overflowing with freshly printed missing person posters—the ones he’d run off from the old Book Pirates printer, still smudged with ink in some corners.
His fingers were sticky, his shirt clung to his back, and his shoulders ached from hours of postering. But he didn’t stop moving until there was nowhere left to go. Only then did he sit.
A moment later, Will returned, handing him a can of something cold and fizzy before dropping onto the bench beside him. The drink hissed softly as Eddie popped it open, the first real sound of relief either of them had heard all day.
The breeze picked up, brushing through the trees above, carrying with it the scent of fresh grass and the distant hum of campus life—normal, detached, as if the world hadn’t just shifted beneath their feet.
Eddie took a sip, the chill biting his throat, grounding him for a second. He stared straight ahead, silent, the posters fluttering faintly beside his feet. Madeleine’s face smiled up at him from every one.
Will popped open his can, the fizz breaking the silence like a sigh. He took a sip, then leaned back, stretching his legs out in front of him as he eyed the fluttering posters.
“You really think Victoria’s going to go through with it?” he asked, not looking at Eddie.
Eddie didn’t answer right away. He rolled the cold can between his palms, then gave Will a sidelong glance. “You tell me,” he said, dryly. “You’re the one who told her.”
Will let out a short chuckle, bouncing off Eddie’s jab. “Fair enough.”
They lapsed into quiet again. A leaf scraped across the stone path in front of them.
“But seriously though,” Will said, turning a little more toward him. “What do you actually think?”
Eddie exhaled, long and low. “I think…” He hesitated, then shrugged. “I think she won’t.” He tapped the can against his knee. “She will pull away. She’s the type who keeps her hands clean.”
Will didn’t reply right away.
Eddie tilted his head, eyeing him. “So why’d you trust her?”
Will stared at the posters for a long moment. Then he said, quietly, “Because I believe in second chances.”
“Really?” Eddie chuckled, “Second chances?” He gave Will a look, half-curious, half incredulous. “I always figured you more the type to throw a punch and move on. Didn’t peg you for the forgiving kind.”
Will shrugged, but there was no flippancy in it. “If you believe it’s not over if you deem it’s not over…” he said, nodding toward Eddie, “Why can’t that apply to people too?”
Eddie looked at him, “What do you mean?”
“She’s not untrustworthy,” Will continued, “Not unless I say so. Not until she proves it.”
He leaned forward, elbows on knees, eyes on the distance.
“If I gave up on people every time they screwed up, I’d have no one left. And I bet you wouldn’t either.”
Eddie said nothing for a moment. The wind tugged at the edges of the poster stack beside his feet. Madeleine’s face stared up at him—bright, kind, unknowing.
“Fair enough,” he muttered.
Eddie and Will sat silently for a few minutes, the kind of silence that didn’t need to be broken. The kind that hummed with exhaustion and quiet resolve. The late sun painted long amber streaks over the stone paths, and the paper stack at Eddie’s feet rustled faintly in the breeze.
“Eddie!”
A voice, distant.
“Will!”
Another followed.
Both heads turned, jarred from their reverie.
Across the lawn, a small silhouette darted into view—cloak billowing, hair catching the sunlight in a flare of brunette and blonde. Ashley. She looked impossibly small from that distance, like the news itself was dragging her forward. Her pace was uneven, frantic, as she sprinted across the lawn, her figure growing sharper with every step. The sound of her boots striking pavement echoed like heartbeats.
She stopped front of them, chest heaving, strands of hair stuck to her flushed face. Her black jacket hung half-off one shoulder, twisted and lopsided from the run, as if she'd barely managed to throw it on.
“Ed—Will—” she gasped, trying to catch her breath. “Meeting at the library… tonight.”
The two stared at her, startled, adrenaline surging anew.
Ashley leaned forward, palms on her knees, trying to speak between gulps of air.
“Victoria…” she finally said, lifting her gaze to meet theirs. “She found a lead into Madeleine’s kidnapping.”

-o-

They settled into their usual spots in the Grand Library’s back alcove. Eddie perched on the edge of the long oak table, Alchemy textbook open to a half-finished diagram, notebook balanced on his knee. Will flopped into the chair beside him, elbow propped on the table. Ashley drifted down a nearby aisle, rifling through tomes on witchcraft lore. And, behind the reception desk, Claire kept her head buried in a stack of reference scrolls, though Eddie could see the tension stiffen her shoulders whenever she thought no one was watching.
Will broke the silence. “Seriously, you’re off chasing kidnappers, sneaking into Chimaera dens, and still thinking about Alchemy?” He waved at Eddie’s open textbook and the neat rows of notes piling up. “Finals aren’t for another few months—have a little fun.”
Eddie didn’t look up. He tapped a pencil against the page. “Finals are in a few months,” he said evenly. “If I survive whatever hellhole we’re about to break into, at least I won’t have to scramble through half a semester’s worth of material at the last minute.”
Will whistled, slapping the table with mock horror. “I’m so glad I stuck with Bardry. I’d be dead by lecture two if I’d taken Alchemy.”
Eddie glanced up at him, grin sharp. “Given how you treat your coursework—showing up late, doodling song lyrics in your margins—you wouldn’t survive a week in Rheagan’s lab.”
Will threw his head back in laughter. “Hey, those lyrics are going to change the world one day!”
Hearing a knock on the door, Claire stood up, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. 
“Victoria’s here,” she announced, 
Claire then rose from her stool at the reception desk. She strode to the heavy wooden door, produced a small brass key, and slid the lock open with a practiced click.
The door swung inward, and Victoria stepped into the lamplit hush of the library, flanked by two of her closest allies on the Student Council—each in similarly tailored blazers and perfectly pleated skirts. Their polished shoes tapped softly on the marble floor as they entered.
Victoria’s gaze swept the long oak table where Eddie, Will, and Ashley waited. 
“Operating hours are over by now,” she said crisply, arms crossed beneath her blazer. “By Council regulations, the library is closed after dusk. Claire, what are you doing? You can’t break the rules just because you feel like it.”
Claire met her squarely. “According to the library’s charter,” she replied firmly, “it remains open whenever the key holder is present. And as the current volunteer librarian, I decide its hours. My availability extends past dusk—so I’m opening the library.”
Victoria opened her mouth to retort—something about Council oversight and disciplinary procedures—but before she could speak, one of her silent companions stepped forward.
“Actually, Victoria,” the girl said calmly, “this library falls under the University’s Public Service Mandate, not the Student Council’s jurisdiction. Council rules don’t apply here.”
Victoria’s eyes snapped to her friend, and for a moment, her carefully cultivated composure faltered. She drew in a breath, lips pressing into a thin line.
“Fine,” she said at last, voice quiet but laced with bitterness. “Do as you will.”
She turned, smoothed the front of her blazer, and took a seat at the far end of the long table—just close enough to the group to listen, but far enough to keep her distance. Her two friends fell in beside her, and the library’s hush settled around them once more, the rules upheld and the real work about to begin.
Ashley leaned forward, voice low and urgent. “Is it true you actually found a lead on Madeleine’s disappearance?”
Victoria said nothing. Instead, she ordered her silent council companions. The girl gave a slight bow, then rose and reached into her sleek leather satchel. She produced three official-looking folders—embossed with the crest of a well-known private investigation firm—and laid them carefully on the table.
The folders clicked open as Victoria drew them forward. Their contents—handwritten notes, hastily sketched maps, and transcribed witness statements—spilled into view.
Victoria’s tone was cool but purposeful. “I didn’t wait for the police. I engaged a private investigator—someone with the resources to move faster than the precinct ever could.” She tapped one dossier. “Their latest lead points to a pet shop in the Hallowmere district. Owner’s name is Gareth Hudson.” She then turned to Eddie, “your Alchemy lecturer.”
Eddie’s pen clattered against the table. “Blythe? As in Professor Blythe, the one teaching States Transformation Basics?” He glanced at Claire, then back at Victoria. “He’s obsessed with mythical creatures. I ran into him months ago at the Sanctuary.”
She paused, letting the weight of that information sink in. “It’s not conclusive. But it’s the best lead we have.”
Will exchanged a look with Eddie. Ashley’s hand drifted to the edge of the paperwork—fingers hovering as if she could sense Madeleine’s presence in the lines and smudges.
Ashley glanced at Victoria, brow furrowed. “And your father? Have you managed to reach him with this?”
Victoria rubbed the bridge of her nose, her impeccable composure faltering for the first time. “I’ve tried,” she said, voice tight. “I sent him the dossiers first thing this morning. I called his aide twice.” She paused, folding and unfolding her hands. “But there’s no guarantee he’ll act on it. He’s… distracted by higher-profile cases, political pressure, things I can’t influence.”
Eddie frowned. “So we’ve got a lead, but no official backing?”
Victoria met his gaze, jaw set. “For now. His office won’t commit until they have more concrete proof—financial records, witness affidavits, physical evidence. My involvement only gets the file a few floors higher.”
They exchanged a quick, knowing look around the table—Eddie’s fingers brushed the edge of the dossier, Will’s eyes flicked to the maps and witness statements, Ashley’s hand hovered over the sketch of Blythe’s shop. Everything they needed was right there.
Victoria’s voice cut through the moment. “Whatever you do from here on, you’re on your own. I’m not getting any further involved—I’ve done my part.”
Eddie met her gaze. It was the first time he’d seen any warmth in her expression. “Thank you, Victoria,” he said quietly. “I’m… sorry I doubted you before.”
She looked at him, surprised on his sudden positive response, “Whatever,” then turned back to the files without another word.
Eddie shifted, moving to stand at the head of the table. He caught Will’s and Ashley’s eyes in turn. A spark of urgency lit in them both.
“What are we waiting for?” </Text>

Victoria then enters, with files, the files looked official, she said that she had sped up the investigation by getting a private investigators rather than the police’s one. The files are their leads so far and it had pointed to a petshop at Hallowmere district. But they are still unsure.

Victoria still tries her best to talk to her father, there are no guarentee that the he will act with the information given

Eddie said that they couldn’t wait for longer, they need to go. And so Eddie said he will go to Hallowmere and see for himself. He had faced more dangerous things before in his hometown, some Chimaera is probably nothing.

Ashley talked him down, saying that it’s not only the Chimaera

            <Title>Chapter 15E [Epilogue]</Title>
            <Text>The waves lapped gently against the stone edge of the harbour. A breeze moved through the masts and ropes, soft and salt-sweet, carrying the scent of seaweed and smoke. Eddie sat on the bench, hands tucked into his coat pockets, watching the tide shift. He didn’t need to be anywhere. Not right now.
Will and Ashley were gone. He could still picture the way Will clapped his back—too hard, grinning like nothing had changed—and Ashley’s hug, brief but tight. She’d wiped her eyes when she pulled away. Then they were walking down the pier, their silhouettes fading into the crowd, like a page turning.
Now it was just Eddie. Alone, but not lonely.
The past year felt like it belonged to someone else. Or maybe it had only ever been waiting for him to catch up.
He stared out at the boats, the slow glint of sunlight on the water, the glimmer of distant towers beyond the curve of the harbour. Edenfield. It didn’t feel foreign anymore.
There was a quiet inside him. Not the numb kind. Not the kind that came with doubt or fear. A settled quiet, like dust finally falling after a storm. He didn’t feel like he had all the answers. But he wasn’t chasing them anymore. He was here.
The bench creaked slightly as he shifted. His fingers brushed something in his coat pocket—a smooth, misshapen stone. He pulled it out and turned it in his palm. One of his first failed transmutations, or what he used to think was a failure. The thing was ugly, uneven, half-glass, half-char. But in the light, it caught a warm, amber glow. Almost like it had decided what it wanted to be, after all.
The wind brushed through his hair, cool and clean, carrying with it the hush of the coming evening. The sky above Bright Harbour had begun to soften into violet, the first stars timidly blinking awake. Eddie closed his eyes for a moment, letting the breeze wash over him. The salt. The hush. The steady pulse of waves against stone.
Then—clack. clack. clack.
Footsteps. Sharp, deliberate. Boots on cobblestone.
He opened his eyes but didn’t turn right away.
“Is this seat occupied?” the voice asked—dry, slightly amused, with the same precise cadence he remembered.
Eddie glanced to his right.
Short red hair, windswept but neat. A sharp jawline. And just above the collar of her coat, the distinct point of an Elven ear catching the light.
She didn’t smile, not really. But there was a softness around her eyes that hadn’t been there the last time he saw her.
“No,” Eddie said, shifting slightly to the side. “Suit yourself.”
She sat without a word, folding her coat neatly beneath her as if the bench were a chair in a grand hall. For a moment, neither of them spoke.
They just looked out at the water, two silhouettes beneath the gathering stars.
Catherine shifted slightly, one boot crossing over the other.“So,” she said, her voice quieter now, “how’s Edenfield treating you?”
Eddie leaned back on the bench, head tilting as he watched a distant fishing boat drift along the bay. He thought for a moment.
“It’s been… an experience,” he said finally. “I’ve never been far from home before. Let alone to a place this—different. Edenfield has its own rhythm, its own language. Even the air feels like it belongs to a different world.”
He paused. “I think… just being here changed me. The way I think. The way I see people. Myself.”
Catherine didn’t answer right away. But when she did, her voice held the calm weight of someone who’d long made peace with discomfort.
“That’s the nature of Alchemy,” she said. “You don’t know what you’re truly made of until you’re broken down to your most essential essence.” She paused, her gaze still on the water. “But being broken down hurts. No one likes it. We pretend we do, but—truth is, sometimes we just want to snap. Just to escape the pressure of change.”
Eddie didn’t respond. He sat with that. The words worked their way inside him like a gentle current.
And then, quietly, he spoke.
“It’s not over if you deem it’s not over.”
Catherine turned her head. For once, surprise flickered across her face.
A moment passed.
Then she smiled—not her usual wry smirk, but something smaller. Warmer.
She echoed it softly.“It’s not over if you deem it’s not over.”
They sat in silence for a while. The sea moved slowly before them, as if the whole world had exhaled.
Then, without looking at him, Catherine spoke.“So… are you going back to Oregon?”
Eddie nodded. “Yeah. It’s summer break, after all.”He paused, then added, “Kind of feeling homesick. Thought I wouldn’t, but… I do.”
She hummed softly in response. It wasn’t judgmental—just acknowledgement.
“What about you?” Eddie asked, glancing sideways. “Where are you going?”
Catherine’s lips twitched, just a hint of mischief in the corner of her mouth. She rested her arms on her knees, still watching the harbour.“Everywhere,” she said. “So… that’s where I’m going.”
Eddie let out a quiet laugh through his nose. That was the most Catherine answer possible.
She didn’t elaborate, and he didn’t push. The wind picked up slightly, and a gull called overhead. Somewhere far off, bells chimed across the city.

            <Title>Chapter 25 RAW</Title>
            <Text>As they made their way back along the Traveler’s Path, the air felt lighter, yet Eddie’s shoulders remained tense. His eyes flickered toward the treetops, the shifting shadows between the ancient trunks. The forest had stilled, the earlier unease fading into a quiet hum of distant crickets and rustling leaves.
But Eddie’s instincts hadn’t relaxed.
The Nightingale Dragon had not disappeared from his thoughts.
And then—he saw it.
At the very edge of the path, just beyond the glow of the Lumina flowers, a massive silhouette emerged from the darkness. Black scales melted into the shadows, a towering figure barely distinguishable from the night.
Eddie’s breath caught. It was watching him.
But the hunger, the primal menace from before—it was gone.
The dragon’s many eyes gleamed in the dim light, save for the one that was missing—the wound Eddie had inflicted still fresh. Yet, there was no fury in its gaze.  
For a long, breathless moment, Eddie and the creature locked eyes. A silent exchange passed between them, one he couldn’t quite put into words.
And for the first time, in the presence of something so vast, so powerful—he didn’t feel afraid.
A voice called from ahead.
“Hey, Ed! Where are you?”
Eddie blinked. Markus stood farther up the path, peering back at him with concern.
When Eddie glanced over his shoulder again—the dragon was gone.
Not even a shifting shadow remained. Only the tranquil night and the soft glow of enchanted flowers. The air felt… undisturbed.
Eddie exhaled slowly.
“It was there,” he murmured, more to himself than the others. “I think the dragon is watching us.”
Markus frowned, looking around. “What? I don’t see anything.”
Torrie and Catherine exchanged glances, but neither said a word.
And yet—none of them questioned him.
Maybe it was the steadiness in his voice, or the calm that had settled over him. But for now, that was enough.
With everyone now relatively at ease, Markus glanced around and asked, “Did everyone get what they needed from the forest?”
Catherine didn’t answer right away. Instead, she reached into her satchel, fingers brushing against something old, delicate—forbidden. When she finally withdrew it, her eyes gleamed with the excitement of her find.
“Far more than I expected,” she murmured.
In her hands was a thick, leather-bound codex, its cover worn with age, the spine barely holding together. Dark ink crawled along the front in an archaic script, its meaning just barely recognizable. A faint, almost unnatural hum emanated from within, as if the pages themselves were whispering secrets best left forgotten.
“What… is that?” Eddie asked warily.
Catherine exhaled, turning the codex over in her hands, almost as if weighing whether to speak. “The records of Craemonia Bastion.”
The name sent a shiver down Eddie’s spine. He had read about it before—a place of experiments, where scholars once twisted the laws of nature in pursuit of something beyond alchemy.
“The bastion was known for its—” Catherine hesitated, as if even saying it out loud felt wrong. “Its research on living creatures. Fusions. Alterations. The creation of… Crimaeras.”
Torrie’s face paled. “Like—those stitched-together things? The ones from the old war stories?”
“Not just stories, Torrie. They were real once.”
Eddie swallowed hard. He had seen sketches in old texts—beasts with limbs that didn’t match, stitched from different species, their bodies barely holding together under the weight of their own unnatural existence.
“According to rumors,” Catherine continued, flipping through the brittle pages, “the researchers documented everything. Their methods, their failures, their—” she stopped, choosing her words carefully. “Their insights.”
Eddie frowned. “Alchemical insights?”
She hesitated again. “Something resembling it. A perversion of it, if you can even call it that.”
Eddie folded his arms. “And you thought bringing this thing back was a good idea? That’s black magic, Catherine.”
Catherine didn’t flinch. “Is it?” she murmured. “Or is it just… knowledge that was never given the chance to be used for something else?”
Eddie stared at her, disbelief flashing in his eyes. “Something else? You think this could be used for good?”
She looked up at him then, something burning in her expression. “If we can transmute living tissue—think about what that means, Eddie. What if wounds could be healed in an instant? What if lost limbs could be restored? What if diseases could be reversed at the source?”
Eddie’s jaw clenched. He wanted to argue. He wanted to tell her it was wrong. That the Bastion’s work had never been about healing, only destruction.
But something about the way she looked at him—the way her fingers pressed into the pages as if she could will the words into something greater—made him hesitate.
Maybe this was what she meant earlier.
Maybe Catherine had gone into the depths of the unknown not to wield dark knowledge… but to change it.
To turn something monstrous into something that could save.
The group pressed forward through the forest, the tension of their earlier discovery fading into the rhythm of their footsteps. Their conversation flowed with ease—a blend of excitement and relief. The dark woods, once menacing, now felt like nothing more than a backdrop to their shared adventure.
Eddie found himself turning Catherine’s words over in his mind. He had been so certain, so unwilling to see anything but the danger in her discovery. But… what if she was right? What if this knowledge, feared and buried, could be reclaimed—not for war, but for healing?
He exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “You know… if this actually works, it could change everything.”
Catherine’s eyes flickered with surprise before softening. “It could.”
He looked at her, then at the Codex tucked under her arm. “Revolutionizing the medical field… it’s a strange thought, considering where it came from.”
Catherine smiled. Not her usual teasing smirk, but something warmer—genuine. “You’re thinking like an alchemist again.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard.
She gave him a light nudge. “Magic is powerful, but it’s also wondrous. There’s still so much to explore, Eddie.”
He hesitated, then nodded, a thoughtful expression settling on his face. “…Yeah. I suppose there is.”
As they neared the edge of the forest, the familiar safety of the Traveler’s Path stretched ahead. The sight brought an unspoken relief to the group, their steps a little lighter. Markus started talking about the ingredients they’d gathered, Torrie chimed in with a playful remark, and Catherine laughed—a sound bright with the joy of survival.
But Eddie barely heard them.
His body was slowing down, warmth creeping uncomfortably through his limbs. His breath came quicker, but the air felt thick, too heavy to properly fill his lungs. His vision wavered, the trees around him stretching and twisting before snapping back into place.
He wiped at his brow. His sleeve came away damp with sweat.
When had it gotten so hot?
He tried to focus, to keep his balance, but the ground beneath him tilted. His legs faltered, the weight of his own body suddenly too much.
“Eddie?” Markus’s voice cut through the haze, tinged with concern. “You alright?”
Eddie parted his lips to answer, but the words wouldn’t come.
Then—the world lurched.
The distant lights of Weshaven blurred into streaks of gold and blue. The voices of his friends warped, muffled as if underwater. Catherine’s face swam into view, her expression shifting from casual to alarmed.
“Eddie, you’re—”
But he didn’t hear the rest.
His knees buckled. Darkness surged at the edges of his vision. The last thing he saw was their hands reaching for him—then the world gave way beneath him, and he fell.
Fell into silence.

            <Title>Chapter 11E</Title>
            <Text>The moment the heavy door clicked shut behind them, the chaotic din of the menagerie vanished, replaced by a low, sterile hum.
They were standing in a nightmare of white tile and stainless steel.
The room was large, cold, and unnervingly clean, the antithesis of the grimy corridor they had just escaped. The air smelled sharply of antiseptic and ozone. Harsh fluorescent lights on the ceiling banished all shadows, reflecting off the pristine, white-tiled walls and floor. Along one wall were cages, but these were different—sleek, dark, and reinforced, their occupants hidden in deep shadow. On steel counters, surgical implements and strange alchemical glassware were arranged with chilling precision.
And in the very center of the room, under the brightest of the lights, was a metal operating table. A figure was strapped to it, covered only by a thin, white sheet.
Ashley gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. Will's face went pale, his gaze locked on the table. A wave of cold dread washed over Eddie, colder than the sterile air in the room. This was it. The heart of the operation.
Leaving Will and Ashley to watch the door, Eddie moved forward alone, his footsteps echoing softly in the unnerving quiet. Each step felt heavy, his heart hammering against his ribs. He was terrified of what he would find. A stranger? A monster in mid-transformation?
He reached the table. His hand trembled as he gripped the corner of the sheet. He took a steadying breath and pulled it back.
It was Madeleine.
Her face was pale, almost translucent under the harsh light, and her hair was fanned out across the metal headrest. Dark leather straps bound her wrists, ankles, and chest to the table. An IV tube ran from a humming machine to a needle in her arm, dripping a liquid that pulsed with a faint, sickly yellow light. She was unconscious, but she was alive.
A choked sound, half-sob, half-gasp, escaped Eddie's lips. &quot;Maddie...&quot;
He reached out, his fingers brushing her cheek. It was cool to the touch. &quot;Madeleine, wake up,&quot; he whispered, his voice urgent but gentle. He gave her shoulder a soft shake. &quot;Come on, wake up. It's me. It's Eddie.&quot;
Her eyelids fluttered. A low moan escaped her lips, and her head lolled to the side. After a moment, her eyes slowly opened, but they were glassy, unfocused.
&quot;E-Eddie...?&quot; Her voice was a faint, slurred whisper, thick with sedation. &quot;Hurts... so tired...&quot;
&quot;I know. We're getting you out of here,&quot; he promised, his voice thick with emotion. He immediately turned his attention to the strap on her wrist. &quot;Will! Ash! Get over here!&quot;
They rushed to his side. The relief on their faces was immediately replaced by grim determination.
&quot;The buckles are complex,&quot; Will noted, his nimble fingers already probing one of the restraints on her ankle.
&quot;They're warded,&quot; Ashley added, her eyes narrowed as she saw the faint magical symbols etched into the leather. She held the crystal of her staff over the strap on Madeleine's other arm. &quot;Stand back.&quot;
As Ashley chanted a soft counter-spell, the symbols flickered and died, and Will managed to undo the physical clasp. While they worked on the other restraints, Eddie carefully slid the IV needle from Madeleine's arm, pressing his thumb against the spot.
The last strap fell away. With a collective sigh of relief, Eddie and Will immediately moved to help Madeleine, sliding their arms under hers and lifting her gently from the cold metal table.
Her legs buckled the moment they touched the floor. She was a dead weight, leaning heavily on them, her head lolling as she tried to fight through the fog of the sedative.
&quot;Easy, Mads, we've got you,&quot; Eddie murmured, his voice thick with relief. He and Will supported her, their faces grim with determination. Ashley, meanwhile, crept to the steel door, pressing her ear against it, listening.
&quot;It's quiet for now,&quot; she whispered back to them. &quot;Let's move before that changes.&quot;
&quot;Come on, let's get out of here,&quot; Eddie said, beginning to guide Madeleine's unsteady steps toward the door they'd just breached.
They took one step. Two. Then Madeleine's feet dragged to a halt. Weak as she was, she planted her heels, resisting their movement with surprising force.
&quot;No,&quot; she rasped, her voice thin but resolute. &quot;Wait.&quot;
Eddie looked at her, his expression a mixture of confusion and impatience. &quot;Maddie, what are you doing? We have to go. Now.&quot;
&quot;There are others,&quot; she said, shaking her head slowly, trying to clear it. She lifted a trembling hand and pointed towards another, smaller door at the far end of the sterile, white-tiled laboratory. &quot;In there. I heard them screaming earlier.&quot;
The relief on Eddie's face curdled into disbelief. &quot;What? We can't,&quot; he argued, his voice a harsh, desperate whisper. &quot;We came for you. We barely made it in here. We have to get you out, that's the mission.&quot;
Madeleine pulled against his grip, her eyes, though still hazy, flashing with a familiar, stubborn fire. The caretaker of the Sanctuary, the protector of the vulnerable, was surfacing through the drugs.
&quot;And leave them here?&quot; she fought back, her voice gaining a sliver of strength from her conviction. &quot;To be cut up and turned into... into those things out in the hall?&quot; She looked him dead in the eye. &quot;I'm not going anywhere. Not while they're still in here.&quot;
&quot;Madeleine, be reasonable!&quot; Eddie pleaded, his desperation mounting. &quot;You can barely stand! We can come back with help!&quot;
&quot;There is no help!&quot; she countered, her voice cracking. &quot;The police won't listen, you know that! We are the only chance they have.&quot; She drew a shuddering breath, her entire body trembling with the effort. &quot;I will not leave them to die. You can go if you want, but I'm not leaving this room unless it's with them.&quot;
Eddie stared at Madeleine, his mind racing, caught between the tactical imperative to escape and the undeniable truth in her eyes. He looked at Will and Ashley, and saw the same conflict reflected back at him. They had their friend back, but leaving others to that same fate—or worse—felt like a hollow victory. He let out a long, shuddering breath, the frustration draining out of him, replaced by a heavy, grim resolve.
&quot;Damn it,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You're right. Of course, you're right.&quot;
Madeleine gave him a weak but grateful nod. The silent argument was over. They were all in this together.
With Will supporting Madeleine, Eddie took the lead, crossing the sterile white room to the smaller door at the far end. It was a simple, windowless steel door, far less intimidating than the last one. He listened for a moment, hearing nothing but a faint, rhythmic dripping. Cautiously, he tried the handle. It was unlocked.
He pushed the door open a crack and peered inside. The breath caught in his throat.
The room beyond was not another lab. It was a dim, foul-smelling holding pen. And it was filled with cages. Cages stacked three high, lining every wall. But these cages didn't hold monstrous creatures; they held people. Men and women of all ages, dressed in simple grey tunics, their faces gaunt and listless. Some stared blankly at the walls, others were curled up asleep, their bodies thin and frail. Eddie did a quick, horrifying count. There had to be at least twenty of them.
He pulled back from the door, his face ashen. &quot;My God,&quot; he choked out. &quot;She was right. There are so many.&quot;
The scale of the operation, the sheer, depraved evil of it, hit them all like a physical blow. This was bigger than they could have imagined.
&quot;We can't get them all out at once,&quot; Will said, his voice low and practical, immediately shifting into problem-solving mode. &quot;We'd be spotted in a second.&quot;
&quot;We need cover,&quot; Ashley said, her mind already racing through her repertoire of spells. &quot;Something to hide the movement, the noise.&quot; She planted the butt of her staff on the tiled floor. &quot;I can do it. A Mirror Veil. It's a high-level illusion. It will bend the light and sound around the doorway. To anyone looking down the hall from the main lab, this area will look empty and silent. But it's draining. I'll need to hold my focus the entire time.&quot;
&quot;Good. That's our shield,&quot; Eddie said, latching onto the plan. &quot;Will, you stay by the main entrance. You're our early warning. One knock if someone's coming, we hide. Two knocks, we run.&quot;
&quot;Got it,&quot; Will affirmed, moving to his post.
Eddie looked at Madeleine. &quot;The locks on these cages will be standard. I can get through them fast.&quot;
&quot;And I'll get them ready,&quot; Madeleine said, a new strength in her voice. The weakness from the sedative was still there, her body still trembled, but her purpose was a fire that burned away the haze. She was no longer a victim to be saved; she was a rescuer.
With a nod, Ashley closed her eyes and began to chant softly. The air around the holding pen door shimmered, distorting like heat haze over a hot road. Will took his position, a silent sentinel.
Eddie and Madeleine slipped through the illusionary veil and into the holding pen. The smell of fear and despair was overpowering. As Eddie moved to the first cage, placing his hand over the lock, a green glow illuminating his determined face, Madeleine moved to the second.
She knelt down, her voice a soft, steady whisper to the terrified woman inside. &quot;It's okay,&quot; she said, her own recent trauma lending her words an undeniable authenticity. &quot;We're getting you out of here. My friends are opening the locks. When your door is open, stay silent and be ready to move.&quot;
A flicker of hope ignited in the woman's eyes.
Hiss. The first lock dissolved into dust under Eddie's touch.
A system was born in the heart of that sterile hell. A rhythm of hope against a backdrop of tension. As Eddie worked his silent, corrosive magic, Madeleine moved from cage to cage, her quiet words a balm, turning panicked victims into a silent, coordinated army, ready for a freedom they hadn't dared to dream of moments before.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 4E_V3</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine rushed down the stone corridors of the Alchemy Faculty building, the sound of her boots echoing off the walls as she hurried toward her Herbology lab. Her satchel bounced against her side with each step, and she barely spared a glance at the enchanted timepiece hanging from her belt, the hands rapidly ticking past the minutes. She had completely lost track of time.
Damn it, Madeleine, she thought, how did I let this happen?
She hadn’t meant to lose track of time. But between her backlog of Herbology assignments and the scrawled notes she’d been poring over—notes about the tiger, about Eddie, about that eerie resemblance—it had all started to unravel. Something about it gnawed at her, a puzzle missing its center.
She turned sharply down a narrow hallway, nearly colliding with a floating cart of flasks.
Focus.
One thing at a time.
The heavy oaken door to the Herbology lab loomed ahead, carved with ivy and curling vines that shimmered faintly in the light. As she reached for the handle, her heart pounded—half from the run, half from the fear that she was already too late.
But the soft murmur of voices inside met her ears, and when she eased the door open, she exhaled with relief.
The professor wasn’t here yet.
Inside, students clustered in groups, tending to glass terrariums, adjusting runic lighting, or arguing softly over pruning techniques. The scent of damp moss and pollen clung to the air like mist.
Madeleine slipped inside quietly, closing the heavy door behind her with a soft click. She scanned the room quickly, eyes darting over the clusters of students and their green, glowing plants, until they settled on a familiar figure near the back. Walther sat hunched over his workstation, his fingers moving steadily across a piece of parchment covered in neat, looping script.
Without hesitation, Madeleine crossed the room and slid into the chair beside him. The moment her weight settled, the door creaked again—Professor’s arrival—and the low hum of anticipation rippled through the lab.
Walther looked up briefly, his dark eyes narrowing as he took in the flushed, breathless expression on her face. “Madeleine, you’re late,” he said, voice quiet but edged with mild amusement. “You’re usually the first one here. What kept you? Another marathon at the Sanctuary?”
She swallowed, forcing a tired smile. “Something like that.”
She didn’t want to say more, especially not here—not with half the class listening and Walther’s perceptive gaze pressing gently but firmly.
Instead, she nodded toward his parchment. “What are you working on?”
Walther’s lips twitched into a rare, almost-smile. “Just some notes on the growth patterns of the Shadeleaf vine. It’s been acting… unusual lately. I thought you’d want to know.”
Madeleine’s eyes flickered to the vine creeping near their workstation, its dark leaves twisting strangely toward the light. “Unusual how?”
He shrugged, but there was a tension beneath the movement. “Hard to say. I’ll show you later. For now, just keep an eye on it.”
She nodded again, grateful for the shift in focus. Here, at least, was a small fragment of normality.
The professor’s voice cut through the murmurs, drawing everyone’s attention. “Today, we will be testing hypotheses on the growth behaviors of Luminara nox, a plant known for its bioluminescent properties in low-light environments. Your assignment is to observe and record the plant’s response to varied light frequencies. You may begin.”
Madeleine nodded absently, still feeling the weight of sleepless nights and the gnawing mystery at the back of her mind. She reached down to her satchel to pull out her binders, intending to get her notes ready.
But as she yanked the bag up hastily, her tired fingers slipped. Instead of the binder’s sturdy spine, her grip caught the loose papers tucked behind it. In an instant, a flurry of parchment spiraled out, fluttering down like autumn leaves across the stone floor.
“Oh, no,” Madeleine muttered under her breath, cheeks flushing as she crouched to gather the scattered sheets.
Walther, sitting beside her, was already reaching down to help, his calm presence a quiet anchor amid her embarrassment. “Here,” he said softly, handing her a few papers with an easy efficiency.
“Thanks,” she murmured, biting her lip as she carefully stacked them back into the binder.
Madeleine crouched, carefully gathering the scattered papers with Walther’s steady help. Each sheet slipped back into her binder brought a small wave of relief. Almost all of it was accounted for—except one.
Her eyes followed Walther’s gaze as he held a single page between his fingers. His expression shifted sharply, a flicker of something like horror mixed with disbelief crossing his usually unreadable face.
“Walther?” Madeleine’s voice was low but urgent. “Can you give me that?”
He didn’t say a word, his fingers tightening around the paper as if it burned him. Her heart quickened, unease prickling beneath her skin.
With a quick tug, she yanked the page from his grasp, pulling it closer to her. Her breath caught as she recognized the sketch sprawled across the parchment.
It was the drawing she’d made—the detailed, haunting sketch Eddie had described to her of the tiger-human chimaera.
Madeleine’s pulse hammered in her ears as Walther’s wide eyes met hers, his usual calm shattered for a fleeting moment. She quickly hid the paper beneath her binder, forcing her voice steady.
“Where did you...?”
Walther’s lips pressed into a thin line, eyes darkening. For the first time, the mysterious distance around him felt like something more—something dangerous.
Madeleine swallowed, her secret suddenly feeling heavier than ever. 

-o-

The moon hung low over Edenfield’s towering spires, its silver glow pooling on the cobbled pathways. Lanterns flickered in the cold breeze as Madeleine stepped out of the Alchemy building, tugging her scarf tighter and buttoning her coat all the way up to her chin. The night bit at her cheeks, and the long day pressed against her shoulders like a weight.
She was halfway down the steps when she heard it.
“Madeleine.”
She turned, catching sight of Walther’s figure leaning against one of the columns, his silhouette long and still under the lanternlight.
“Oh, hey,” she said, flashing her usual warm smile despite the late hour and her exhaustion. “What’s up?”
Walther stepped closer. “I wanted to ask you something,” he said, his voice quieter than usual, but no less firm. “That sketch you dropped earlier… where did you get the idea for it?”
Madeleine hesitated for a breath too long. Her mind spun.
“Just... something I threw together,” she said lightly, tucking her hands into her coat pockets. “A badly drawn South Alamirian Tiger, honestly. It’s not exactly accurate.”
Walther didn’t laugh. He didn’t even blink.
“You’re lying,” he said calmly. “Is this about Eddie? You think a South Alamirian Tiger attacked him?”
She glanced away, toward the line of trees swaying in the wind. “It’s just a hunch,” she admitted, careful with her words.
Walther stepped forward again, his brows lowering. “Madeleine, South Alamirian Tigers come from the eastern dunes. There hasn’t been one seen this far west in decades. Certainly not in Edenfield.”
Madeleine met his gaze. Her voice was quiet, but steady. “I know. That’s why I’m curious.”
A long pause hung between them, the cold wind threading between their words. Walther studied her with that same unreadable expression he always wore, but this time, something in his eyes looked sharper—cutting through the calm.
And yet, he said nothing more. 

-o-

Madeleine’s boots clicked softly on the stone path as she crossed the campus grounds, the foggy air curling around her like ghostly ribbons. Her scarf was pulled tight around her neck, and she buttoned her coat all the way up, her gloved hands tucked into her sleeves to fend off the creeping cold.
The lamplight from the faculty buildings spilled in golden puddles onto the walkway, but the rest of Edenfield was dim and quiet—students tucked away in their dorms or libraries, the hum of campus life reduced to stillness.
She reached the bus stop at the edge of the quad, where the wrought-iron sign swayed slightly in the breeze. The enchanted schedule flickered faintly, glowing with runes that shifted to show Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
With a quiet sigh, Madeleine sat down on the bench, the cold seeping through the wooden slats. She leaned back and let her head tilt toward the sky, watching her breath fog in the moonlight. 
Her gaze drifted out across the empty road, unfocused.
But her thoughts didn’t stay still for long. They circled back—inevitably—to her conversation with Walther.
He’d acted strangely. Not obviously so, but off. She’d known him since the start of term, shared a lab bench with him more days than not. He was reliable. Reserved. Never the type to get worked up about… anything, let alone one of her messy drawings.
He had never shown the slightest interest in her sketches before. Never once asked her where she got her ideas, let alone stared at one like he’d seen a ghost.
Why today?
Then it hit her. Of course. Walther had mentioned in passing—once, maybe twice—that he was studying the anatomy and vascular structures of South Alamirian Tigers. That was probably why the drawing caught his eye. That had to be it.
Still, something didn’t sit right.
She sat up straighter, her fingers curling against her knees. Wait.
Walther volunteered at the Sanctuary. But unlike her—who cleaned enclosures, administered salves, handled creature check-ups—Walther never worked in the physical sections. He was never on feeding duty, never in the recovery stables, never doing the dirty work. His role was… research. Always research.
He studied the creatures. Dissected their physiology through observation and notes. He didn’t care for them. He studied them.
And there was more. He volunteered with Edenfield’s Food Shelter Society. Madeleine remembered him saying that once, off-handedly, like it didn’t matter. They helped the city’s unhoused population. They delivered food, yes—but also went into places people didn’t like to talk about. Old tunnels, abandoned corners of the city. The underbelly.
Two things clicked. Then three. Then four.
Madeleine’s breath caught in her throat.
Research… deep anatomical knowledge… access to vulnerable populations… a strange, cold fascination with a creature that shouldn’t exist…
Her hand flew to her satchel, as if instinctively checking her sketches were still there.
Her face slowly paled, lips parting slightly as a horrible thought took shape. Not fully formed—but enough to cast a shadow over everything she’d been trying to ignore.
Could it be?
No. No, that’s insane… she told herself. But her gut didn’t agree. Her heart was thudding now, dull and fast beneath her scarf. The pieces didn’t fit perfectly—but they sat too close not to touch.
The wind picked up again, rustling the trees behind the shelter.
Madeleine stared ahead, her eyes wide, her breath held.
The bus rolled up in the distance. But she no longer felt the comfort of home awaiting her. Only a hollow, rising dread.

-o-

The bus hissed to a stop at the edge of Aetherell Reach. Madeleine didn’t wait for the doors to fully open before stepping down. She didn’t thank the driver—a small, almost sacred courtesy she never forgot. But tonight, it slipped her completely.
Her boots hit the pavement. Cold air bit at her cheeks.
She moved fast.
Madeleine spotted the phone booth at the corner just beyond the wrought-iron fence, tucked beneath a flickering lantern. She broke into a brisk jog, her satchel thudding against her side.
The glass door rattled in her grip. She shoved it open and stepped inside, heart pounding. The booth smelled of damp copper and dust, the glass fogged from the cold. Her breath ghosted across the surface as she picked up the receiver with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking.
She slipped a coin into the slot.
Dialled the number from memory.
The ring buzzed against her ear. Once. Twice.
C’mon, Eddie. Please pick up.

-o-

Eddie sat at his desk in the corner of Dormitory 7, shoulders hunched over a thick Alchemical textbook. The diagrams sprawled across the page in tight, looping script, encrypted formulas showing the delicate thresholds between copper and verdigris, gas and flame, matter and memory. Notes were scrawled in his own handwriting along the margins. The desk lamp hummed faintly, casting sharp shadows that danced with every flick of his pen.
He didn’t hear the guitar at first—barely registered the sound amid the quiet storm of his concentration. Will was on the bottom bunk, leaning against the bedframe, head bobbing slightly as he coaxed soft scales out of his guitar. Each note plucked from the strings glowed faintly in the air, trailing runes that pulsed and faded like sparks drifting on water.
The room was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the bunk frame, the gentle thrum of guitar strings, and the scratch of Eddie’s pen as he annotated a particularly difficult transfiguration formula.
He didn’t notice the sound of footsteps approaching.
Didn’t register the hurried knock.
Didn’t hear the door swing open.
&quot;Ashley?&quot; Will said, glancing up.
Ashley stood in the doorway, slightly breathless. Her eyes went straight to Eddie.
“You’ve got a call,” she said. “It’s Madeleine. On the hall phone.”
Eddie looked up, blinking as if surfacing from underwater.
“A call?” he repeated. “Now?”
Will grinned. “Oho, the mystery deepens. She finally cracked and confessed her undying—”
But Ashley didn’t laugh. She didn’t roll her eyes or shove him in the shoulder like she usually would.
She just said, quietly, urgently, “Eddie. You need to come. Now.”
Eddie was already out of his chair.
Eddie jogged down the corridor, bare footsteps thudding against rough floorboards. The dorm hallway was mostly quiet—just the faint hum of lanterns and a distant laugh from someone two floors down. He rounded the corner and spotted the wall-mounted phone at the end of the corridor, its receiver swinging like a pendulum from the base.
His heart kicked up.
He grabbed it mid-swing. “Hello?”
There was a sharp breath of relief on the other end.
“Eddie. It’s me.”
“Madeleine?” His back straightened. “Are you okay? You sound—”
“Listen,” she cut in, voice taut and quick, like a pulled string. “I don’t have time to explain. I need you. I need all of you—Will, Ashley, everyone—at the library. Tonight.”
Eddie blinked. “Wait, what’s happened? What’s going on?”
“It’s—” Her voice cut out for a second. A faint crackle distorted the line. “It’s Walther. I think he’s—”
Bzzzt.
A loud burst of static screamed through the receiver. Eddie yanked it away from his ear, flinching.
“Madeleine?” he called into the noise, trying the hook. “Hello? Madeleine?”
Silence. Then a low mechanical whir. Then nothing at all.
He glanced back down the hall as if expecting Ashley to still be there. “Come on…”
Suddenly—
Click.
“Hello?” he tried again, breath held.
A gasp. “E-Eddie!”
He gripped the receiver tighter. “Madeleine, what’s happening?”
“I think someone’s following me.”
His stomach dropped. “Where are you?”
There was a pause. A rustle. Then, distantly: the creak of a booth door opening. Her voice dropped to a whisper.
“I’m at my apartment. Just past the old fence. Near the east ward sign. There’s someone—he’s not moving, but—”
The line cracked again.
“I’ve got my wand—he’s coming closer—Eddie, I—”
Pop.
The line went dead.
Eddie stood there, frozen, the soft dial tone humming against his ear like a dirge.
Slowly, he lowered the receiver.
He turned.
Will and Ashley were already there at the end of the corridor. Ashley’s face was pale, tense—she’d heard enough to know. But it was Will’s expression that struck Eddie now: no smirk, no joke, just quiet alarm setting into his features like a stormcloud.
Eddie’s eyes met theirs. A flicker. A pause. A breathless moment where nothing needed to be said.
We’ve got to do something.
Ashley gave a sharp nod. Will was already moving.
They grabbed their jackets from the hooks near the dorm stairs, Will slinging his guitar bag over his shoulder out of instinct. No time to ask why. No time to prepare. Only the urgency in Eddie’s blood and the fading echo of Madeleine’s voice in his ear.
Then they stormed out into the night.
Through the arching gates of the dormitory. Across the frost-hushed campus. Their breath rose in quick clouds as they ran—past silent halls, over cobbled paths slick with dew, the gaslamps stretching their shadows long and fast.
Toward Aetherell Reach.
Toward her.</Text>

            <Title>[REV] Prologue V2</Title>
            <Text>&quot;By the gods! H-his face!&quot;

The girl's scream pierced through the silence that had blanketed the classroom, drawing the attention of the other students. 

All eyes turned towards him now, three boys stood at the center. The classroom smells of books, papers, chalks, and blood.  

The first, a boy kneeling on the coarse floorboards, clutched his face as blood oozed through his fingers, staining the wooden floorboards beneath him. His sobs were muffled, drowned out by the overwhelming horror of the moment. His wand, made of sturdy ashen oak and silver engraved accents lies in defeat in front of him. A dragon finally slain… But amidst its den.
The Second, stood over him, the second boy’s breath came hard and fast, his chest heaving. His fist was still clenched, the jade ring on his finger pulsing with a sickly green glow. The air around him crackled, the lingering green transmutation circle hovers over his hand. The mark of an Alchemist in training.
The duel. The anger. The need to win. It still burned in his chest, a fire refusing to die. But then, a voice broke through behind him… shaken and small.
&quot;E-Eddie?&quot;

“Stay back Markus,” The second boy said, “I got this—” 

“Eddie… his face…”
The voice was small, coming from behind him, The Third boy called Markus stood rigid, his face pale, his wide eyes locked on the scene before them. His hands twitched at his sides, as if wanting to reach for Eddie—then thinking better of it. 
&quot;What have you done?&quot; Markus said to him at last.
The glow of the ring flickered. Then, as if drained of life, it dimmed.
Eddie, the second boy blinked. The fire in his chest sputtered, giving way to something colder. He followed Markus’s gaze down—
And saw what he had done.
The Boy lay sprawled on the floorboards, blood seeping between his fingers as he clutched his face. His breathing ragged, wet and pitiful.
Eddie’s stomach lurched.
The duel was over. But the nightmare had just begun.
Whispers began, low and fearful at first, but quickly growing in intensity. Fingers pointed, eyes narrowed in disgust and fear. 
“Did you see that spell? isn’t that…”
“Isn’t it obvious?… And Welton just used it against him?”
“Yeah, look at him…” 
“Someone call the headmaster! Now!”
Eddie stood in the center of it all. The room felt too bright, the lamps flickering against the polished tables, illuminating every horrified stare. His breath came shallow, too fast. He could feel their eyes crawling over him, stripping him bare.
A sense of sickness. The jade ring on his finger sat cold and heavy, and it started to get heavier and heavier. an anchor dragging him down. The weight mounting and mounting. 
He followed their gazes—past the blood on the floor, past Markus’s stricken face—back to his own trembling hands. He looked at it, shaken.
The weight of what he had done pressed in, suffocating.
The door to the classroom burst open. 
Gusts of cold air followed, sweeping through the aftermath of the classroom. Then came the headmaster, his heavy robes rippling like a gathering storm. His gaze sharp enough to cut through the air itself.
Behind him, a procession of teachers flooded in, their presence a verdict before a trial had even begun. Nurses, and Healers pushed through the throng of students, ordering them to make way, their voices sharp and urgent. The Boy was lifted onto a stretcher, his bloodied hands weakly grasping at nothing, his screams still muffled. Someone pressed a cloth to his wound. Someone else muttered a healing incantation.
Eddie barely saw it… He don’t want to,
A hand landed on his shoulder—firm, steady.
He looked up. A round face framed by thinning hair. Brass-rimmed glasses slipping down the bridge of a wide nose. It was Mr. Ferie, his mentor. Deep lines etched into his dark skin with age. His lips were pressed into something that wasn’t quite a frown, not quite a smile—just controlled, measured.
He wasn’t panicking. Or maybe he was, just not showing it. His grip on Eddie's shoulder remained firm, grounding. His voice, when it came, was quiet but unwavering.
&quot;It’s okay,” He said, his hand firm, “Everything’s going to be okay.&quot;
Eddie wanted to believe him. But he couldn’t.
The jade ring on Eddie’s index finger felt as heavy as the mountain itself, its magic… or whatever it had just conjured, now has long gone. 
He barely noticed as they took it away from him, as if the weight of the mountain has been lifted from his very index finger… he felt somewhat free… but he dreaded that feeling.
They led him away from the classroom, away from the chatter, away from the accusations.
The whispers followed him down the corridor, curling against the stone walls, not only his classroom, the whole hallway is filled with students poking their heads out of the classroom windows, muttering his fate in hushed, pitiless tones as Eddie continues his walk of shame. Aella Academy, the very institution itself seemed to recoil before him him—walls narrowing, shadows deepening, as if it could no longer bear to house him.
He had spent years dreaming of these halls. Studying, pushing himself, proving himself.
And now, step by step, it was all being stripped away. Death by a thousand cuts.
The end was waiting for him at the headmaster’s office. A place of judgment. A place of exile.
He knew his sentence had already been passed.
Edward Welton is going to be expelled.

            <Title>Chapter 1E V2</Title>
            <Text>Eddie stirred awake. Blinking against the soft sunlight that streamed through the stained-glass panels above. he found himself in a spacious, vibrant ward he didn’t recognise. The sunlight cast warm red, blue, and green hues across the room. It refracts off the intricate stained-glass windows. 

Rows of clean beds stretched out before him. Each of them is separated by shimmering silk curtains. The curtains caught the sunlight, creating a soft glow. The air was thick with an unsettling peace—too muted for comfort. Faint murmurs of incantations and the soft hum of magic filled the air. Healers, clad in flowing robes that ripple like water, moved gracefully from bed to bed. Their hands glowed as they worked. Their whispers of healing spells were gentle, but to Eddie, they stirred an unease deep inside him. 

His body felt heavy like he was sinking into the plush mattress beneath him. He glanced down at his chest. Bandages wrapped tightly around his chest. He could smell the faint, herbal scent of salves beneath the cloth. His brown wool jacket was gone, replaced by a loose hospital robe. The memory of the attack at the campus flickered in his mind. He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the attack. 
He remembered blacking out on the path home, the pain in his chest, the sense of his body giving up after the attack.
Voices filtered through the silk curtain beside him.
“…I’m telling you, there ain’t no way it was some drunk with a pitchfork,” came Will’s voice, low but insistent. “Eddie was, like, a ten-minute walk from the East Gate. Ain’t no drunk walking off that close to campus without being stopped, Maddie, you know more about this don’t you? What’d you think?”
“I’m not sure,” said Madeleine gently. “The shape of the wounds—it's not consistent with a  weapon. They’re jagged, uneven… it’s like when your cat scratch you, but worse.”
“Yeah, no shit.” Will chuckled, “That must’ve been one hell of a cat.”
“Wait, Madeleine, You think it was a creature?” Ashley’s voice cut in, sharp and focused. “I think that would explain why the police lied. If it was a creature attack, they’d have to report it to the university, and then the Council. Edenfield doesn’t like people thinking the city’s unsafe.”
There was a pause. Eddie kept his breathing steady, not quite ready to let them know he was awake.
“I’m just saying,” Will continued, “We’ve been here long enough. And we know the cops don’t spin that hard unless someone told ’em to. Higher up.”
“I saw the paper this morning,” Claire said simply. Her voice was clipped and factual, like reading from a page. “No mention of magical residue. Which is odd. If it was a Chimaera, it would’ve left traces.”
Another pause.
“But it’s not like they’d put that in the official report,” Ashley snapped. “They’ve been trying to cover this up for months. First the missing pets, then the rumours about the alleys by Red Oak Lane—”
“—And now Edward.” Madeleine’s voice softened. “He could’ve died.”
Eddie blinked slowly, then let out a low groan. The talking stopped instantly.
“He’s awake,” Madeleine said gently, and he heard the shift of feet as someone moved to his bedside.
The curtain drew back, and light spilled across his bed. Madeleine stood closest, her auburn hair catching the light. Will gave him a lopsided grin from beside her, while Ashley crossed her arms and gave him a look that was half-relief, half-scolding.
“Hey man,” Will said, shaking his head. “You gotta stop gettin’ yourself mauled if you want to survive first year.”
“I—I didn’t…” Eddie’s voice cracked. He coughed. His throat felt raw. “What happened?”
“We were hoping you could tell us,” Ashley said, brow furrowed.
“We were told that you were found outside the Astral Garden, unconscious,” Madeleine explained, voice soothing. “Your wounds were… severe. They said it was a pitchfork, but—”
“—But no drunk guy’s walking around Edenfield with a farm tool like some horror film extra,” Will finished.
Eddie groaned and shifted upright, wincing at the pull in his bandaged side. “It was some drunk bloke, Will,” he muttered, his voice hoarse. “Or… at least, I thought so.”
Ashley stepped closer, her brows knitting together. “Eddie,” she said, voice calm but intent, “you can tell us everything. We’re not gonna spill it to anyone.”
She glanced at the others—Madeleine, Will, even Claire—waiting for their confirmation. One by one, they nodded.
Eddie hesitated. The memory was like a cracked mirror—fragments scattered across his mind, sharp and confusing. But one detail glared, undeniable.
“I could’ve sworn it was a person,” he said slowly. “Not some monster. I saw them, just for a second. A silhouette. Tall. Human. Moving weird, but definitely a person.”
The words had barely left his mouth when Madeleine stiffened.
“A person?” she repeated, her voice a pitch higher than usual. “You’re sure? Not an animal? Not some summoned thing?”
Eddie frowned at her reaction. Madeleine, normally so composed—always the calm in any storm—suddenly looked pale. Her fingers clutched the hem of her sleeve.
“I mean—yeah,” he said, uncertain. “It looked like one. Didn’t see a face or anything, but… they held something. Like a—”
“A weapon?” she cut in, eyes wide. “Did it use something to hurt you?”
Will raised his hand like he was in class. “So it’s true—you were attacked by a pitchfork!”
Ashley whirled on him. “Will, shut up!”
Eddie let out a breath, then leaned back against the pillows, eyes distant. “I didn’t think much of it at first,” he said, voice low. “It was almost two in the morning. I’d just left the library—I’d stayed late copying a book for Alchemy. The campus was dead quiet.”
Everyone watched him now. Even Claire had paused her quiet page-turning.
“I was walking past the Archway Garden,” Eddie continued, “and I saw someone just… standing there. Under one of the old gaslamps. Alone. Wearing a suit, just—still. Like a statue.”
Ashley frowned. “A suit?”
Eddie nodded. “Dark-colored. Didn’t look like a student. Or a professor. Just this tall guy. I thought maybe he was lost. Or drunk. I kept walking.”
His voice dropped. “Then I heard footsteps. Behind me. Slow. Limping.”
A hush fell over the group.
“I turned onto Fallow Lane—the one behind the Rune Studies hall,” he said. “And that’s when I saw it again. It was following me. Limping like its leg was twisted or broken. That’s when I started running.”
Madeleine’s hand covered her mouth.
“I didn’t look back until I crossed into the courtyard behind Alchemy Hall. I thought I’d lost it. But when I turned…” Eddie swallowed. “It wasn’t standing anymore.”
He looked up at them. “It was walking on all fours. Like—like a dog. Except it was still wearing the suit. Its arms were too long. And its face…” He blinked, the memory flickering behind his eyes. “Its face wasn’t right. The eyes were too far apart. The skin looked stretched. Like it was trying to look human, but couldn’t quite manage it.”
Silence.
Even Will had nothing.
No joke. No quip.
Just stunned stillness.
Eddie looked between them, the weight of the memory clinging to his chest. “Any idea what that might be?”
For a moment, no one moved.
Then Madeleine spoke. Her voice was barely a whisper. “Chimaera,” she said. “What you just encountered was a Chimaera.”
Eddie sat up straighter, his breath catching. His mind raced—not with fear, but recognition.
“You’re kidding,” he murmured.
But Madeleine wasn’t smiling.
Will blinked. “Okay—gonna need someone to back up a sec and explain what the hell that even is.”
Madeleine didn’t look at him. Her eyes were still locked on Eddie’s, her usual softness tinged with something sharp. “In Alchemical theory, there was a period—about two centuries ago—when a few researchers attempted to… alter the nature of living tissue. Not transmuting metals or changing matter states, but life.”
Will squinted. “You mean, like, magical surgery?”
“No,” Madeleine said. “Not healing. Not enhancement. I mean the forced fusion of multiple living organisms. Stitching animal parts together. Layering magical grafts. Rewiring the essence of a creature until something new emerged. A new species entirely. Something unstable.”
Eddie exhaled slowly. “It was called the Chimerae Program. Officially, it was banned. Unethical, unpredictable, and dangerous.”
“And I thought it was just a myth,” Madeleine said, barely audible. “One of those cautionary tales they use in Magical Ethics.”
Will’s brows rose, visibly unsettled. “So you're telling me someone built that thing? Like—made it?”
“More like they broke a bunch of creatures and mashed ‘em together,” Eddie muttered. “Trust me, it’s not elegant magic. It’s Frankenstein crap.”
“Wait, like… lightning bolts and grave robbing?” Will asked.
Eddie gave him a look. “No. Worse. Alchemically engineered. Living tissue restructured through transformation circles, mutagenic tinctures, and gods know what else. It's one of the few things that both the Arcane Council and the Healers Guild agreed was a step too far.”
“And now it’s here,” Madeleine said quietly, folding her arms. “In Edenfield. Fully formed. Active. Which means someone didn’t just try to make one—they succeeded.”
A thick silence followed Madeleine’s words.
No one spoke.
Then, softly but with a rare note of resolve, Madeleine said, “We have to do something about this.”
She looked around the circle of friends, her brows slightly drawn, eyes steady. For a moment, her usual softness was edged with something almost fierce.
Before anyone could respond, the curtain snapped open with a rustle of silk.
A nurse in pale blue robes stepped in, smiling politely. “Sorry to interrupt. Visiting hours for Mr. Welton are over. The doctor will be in shortly for his examination.”
The group broke from their huddle. Will stood first, patting Eddie lightly on the shoulder. “Alright, man. Heal up. Don’t go fighting any more horror movie monsters without calling me first, yeah? ”
Ashley followed, her tone brisk but warm. “Keep your head clear, Eddie. Rest, but don’t forget what happened. If someone’s covering this up—we’ll find out.”
Claire gave a brief nod, the hem of her robes brushing the polished floor. “Stay sharp, Edward. You’re lucky to be alive.”
Then came Madeleine. She stood near the foot of his bed, her expression softer now, though something lingered behind her eyes—concern, perhaps, or fear she wasn’t voicing.
As the others stepped out, she lingered.
“Hey,” she said, her voice quieter now that it was just the two of them. “Do you know when you’ll be out?”
Eddie shook his head. “Dunno. They said at least a week. Maybe two, if the burns need more time.”
Madeleine nodded slowly. Her fingers fidgeted with the sleeve of her robe.
She stepped closer and offered her hand again. He took it—and this time, she held it for a moment longer.
“Good luck,” she said. “And… stay safe, alright?”
Then she flashed him her familiar warm smile. The one that always seemed to smooth the edges of everything else. “When you’re out—come find me. There’s something I want to show you.”
With that, she waved gently and slipped through the curtain after the others.
Eddie leaned back against the pillows, the room quiet again save for the distant hum of magic.
It was only then that he noticed the slip of paper in his hand.
Neat handwriting curled across the page: Madeleine D. 0712 443 229And beneath it, a simple line:21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground. 
Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.

            <Text>Eddie trudged down the stairs, rubbing the grogginess from his face. The scent of fish soup still clung to the air, though it had long since cooled. As he descended, the creaking steps announced his arrival before he even reached the bottom.
Torrie was already waiting for him. She sat on the couch, legs swinging slightly, her satchel tucked neatly by her side. Her uniform—crisp and freshly pressed—was complete with the wide-brimmed hat perched atop her head. She looked ready to march straight into her first lesson.
Her large round glasses caught the morning light as she turned to face him.
&quot;You overslept again,” she said, crossing her arms.
Eddie scoffed, running a hand through his silver hair. “It’s called resting, actually. Pretty important, y'know. Keeps you from turning into a ghoul.”
Torrie eyed him. “You did remember you were supposed to take me to Aella, right?”
Eddie hesitated just long enough for her smirk to widen.
“Oh my gods,” she groaned dramatically, leaning her head back. “You forgot.”
“Hey, hey, I didn’t forget!” Eddie protested, pointing a finger at her. “I just… temporarily misplaced that piece of information.”
“That’s forgetting.”
Eddie clicked his tongue. “Debatable.”
Torrie shook her head, exasperated but amused. &quot;You’re the worst.&quot;
&quot;And yet,&quot; Eddie shot back, standing up and stretching, &quot;here I am, awake and ready to escort you like the responsible older brother that I am.&quot;
Torrie squinted at him. &quot;Barely.&quot;
Eddie ruffled her hair on the way to grab his satchel, ignoring her protests as she batted his hand away. &quot;C’mon, let’s go before Mum decides to hex me into a broom and fly you there herself.&quot;
The garage was old—probably older than Eddie himself. The wooden beams sagged slightly, and the scent of oil, damp wood, and rust lingered in the air. Dusty sunlight filtered through the gaps in the planks, casting streaks of gold across the scattered tools and forgotten crates.
In the middle of it all stood Eddie’s bike.
It was an ancient, clunky thing—red paint chipped at the edges, the metal frame scuffed from years of use. It had once belonged to his father, and before that, he wouldn’t be surprised if his grandfather had ridden it through these very streets. A relic of the Welton family, barely held together by years of hasty repairs and just enough luck.
Eddie tightened the straps on the back, securing both their satchels before giving the bike a few testing bounces. It creaked but held firm.
Torrie stood nearby, hands behind her back, watching as he worked. “Do you ever clean this thing?”
Eddie scoffed. “It’s got character.”
“It’s got rust.”
“Character and rust,” he corrected, checking the pedals. “That’s what gives it charm.”
As Eddie adjusted the handlebars, he glanced over at her. “So, you thought about what you wanna do for your magical concentration yet?”
Torrie scrunched up her nose. “I just got into Aella, Ed. I’ve got plenty of time to figure that out.”
“You say that now,” Eddie smirked, “And one day, boom, second year sneaks up on you, and suddenly you have to choose whether you wanna be an Alchemist, an Illusionist, a Conjurer, or whatever fancy new stuff they’ve added since my time.”
Torrie shrugged. “Right now, I just wanna make friends, get to know the teachers. No rush.”
As Eddie adjusted the straps on their satchels, Torrie swung her legs idly and tilted her head. “So… are the teachers at Aella really as strict as Mom says?”
Eddie snorted. “Some of them? Absolutely.” He straightened up and leaned against the bike. 
“Take Mrs. Neira” Eddie began, “She teaches Runes. And she teaches that class with an Iron Fist. She’s the kind of teacher who can spot an untucked shirt from fifty paces.”
Torrie groaned. “Great. That sounds fantastic.”
“Oh, and don’t even think about dozing off in her class,” Eddie added. “She once hexed my notes into paper rabbits and hopped away mid-lecture because I didn’t pay attention.”
Torrie’s eyes widened. “You’re joking.”
“Wish I was.”
She slumped dramatically against the wooden railing. “This is already sounding so fun.”
“Well, not all the teachers are terrifying.” Eddie grinned. “Mr. Ferie’s the exact opposite. He teaches Alchemy, and he’s probably the most laid-back teacher at Aella. You’ll like him.”
Torrie perked up. “Why? What’s he like?”
“Well, for one, he actually likes students,” Eddie said, tightening a bolt. “And he’s big on competitions—he’s always picking out students to send to alchemy tournaments. I think he just enjoys the chaos of it all.”
Torrie chuckled. “Sounds like someone I’d actually want to take a class with.”
“Oh, you will,” Eddie smirked as he stood up. “And when you do, tell him I send my regards, and….”
Torrie narrowed her eyes. “…And?”
“And that his socks smell.”
“You’re terrible!” Torrie burst into laughter, “I’m not telling that on my first day!”
Eddie shrugged, grinning. “He’ll know what it means.”
Still giggling, Torrie shook her head as Eddie made the final check. Satisfied, he strode over to the garage door and grabbed the handle. With a heave, he pushed it open.
Light poured in, golden and fresh, chasing away the dust and shadows. Outside, the streets of Weshaven beckoned—cobbled roads damp from morning mist, lined with wooden houses that leaned ever so slightly from the years. The sea breeze carried the scent of salt and fish, mixing with the distant chatter of merchants setting up their stalls.
Eddie swung a leg over the bike, glancing back at Torrie. “Alright, You ready?”
Torrie adjusted her hat, eyes bright. “Ready.”
And with that, they rode off, the old bike rattling down the street as the Welton siblings made their way through the waking town.

-o-

The town of Weshaven stirred to life as Eddie and Torrie rolled down the sloping streets, the crisp morning air tinged with the scent of brine and freshly caught fish. The narrow roads twisted and wove between clustered stone-and-timber houses, their rooftops slick with morning dew.
Below them, the harbor sprawled like a great wooden beast, its docks lined with fishing boats bobbing gently in the tide. The air thrummed with the sounds of the morning commute—sailors calling out as they hauled in nets from the previous night’s catch, shipwrights hammering away at weather-worn hulls, and merchants rolling out their stalls, their carts stacked with exotic wares from distant shores.
Eddie steered carefully as they gained momentum, their satchels bouncing slightly against the back of the bike. The road sloped steeply ahead, the cobblestones uneven in places, but he knew this path like the back of his hand. He kept one foot ready on the brake, just in case.
The street curved, and the town slowly unfurled before them—a lively, salt-kissed pocket of the world, waking up to another day.
Further ahead, moving steadily against the flow of early-morning foot traffic, a broad-shouldered figure in a worn flat cap trudged up the pavement. 
His thick brown curls peeked from beneath the cap, and he carried himself with an easy, unhurried gait despite the weight of the heavy satchel slung over his shoulder. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing arms dusted with faint stains—herbs, ink, or maybe soot from the apothecary’s furnace.
Torrie, perched behind Eddie, squinted as they neared. Then, with a small gasp, she nudged Eddie’s shoulder. “Isn’t that Markus?”
Eddie followed her gaze. Sure enough, it was Markus, making his way toward the apothecary, likely just coming off a delivery run.
With a grin, Eddie squeezed the brakes, slowing the bike as they rolled up beside him. “Oi, Markus! You heading back already?”
Markus glanced up, his tired but good-natured expression shifting into a small smile. “Morning, you two.” His voice was soft, polite as ever. “Making a stop before opening up.”
“I’m clocking in late today,” Eddie admitted, adjusting his grip on the handlebars. “Gotta take Torrie to school first.”
Markus raised his brows, impressed. “That so? What academy are you off to, then?”
Torrie straightened in her seat, her face glowing with pride. “Aella Academy!”
Markus let out an approving hum. “That’s a fine place. You’ll do well there.” Then he glanced toward the harbor. “Ferry leaves in an hour. You two best get going.”
“Yeah, we should,” Eddie agreed, nudging the bike forward. “See you later, Markus!”
“Take care,” Markus said with a small wave.
With that, Eddie and Torrie pushed off, rolling down the street once more, weaving through the waking town.
Eddie gritted his teeth as he steered through the crowded streets, weaving between fishermen hauling in their morning catch, merchants haggling over crates of imported goods, and dockhands rolling barrels toward waiting ships. The salty breeze carried the scent of fish and brine, mingling with the shouts of sailors calling orders across the bustling Bright Harbour.
The ferry was leaving in an hour—but at this rate, it might as well be five minutes.
&quot;Come on, come on,&quot; Eddie muttered, scanning for a gap in the throng.
Torrie clung tightly to his waist. &quot;We’re not gonna make it!&quot;
&quot;Yes, we are,&quot; Eddie shot back, his eyes locking onto an opening between a pair of arguing traders. He hit the pedals hard, propelling the bike forward, skimming past them with barely an inch to spare.
The dock came into view. A bell rang—final boarding call.
With a final burst of speed, Eddie rode up the wooden planks, skidding to a halt just as a deckhand moved to pull up the gangway.
&quot;Two for Osthaven!&quot; Eddie panted.
The deckhand raised an eyebrow but waved them on. Eddie and Torrie scrambled aboard, collapsing onto one of the wooden benches as the ferry gave a low horn and lurched away from the dock.
Torrie exhaled, catching her breath. &quot;That was close.&quot;
Eddie wiped his brow with a grin. &quot;Told you we'd make it.&quot;
&quot;You had to make it,&quot; she teased, nudging him. &quot;You can’t miss the ferry, especially on my first day!&quot;
Eddie chuckled, leaning back against the bench, feeling the weight of the rush fade as the ferry rocked gently with the waves. His eyes drifted out to the horizon, where the sea stretched endlessly toward the east.
Osthaven.
It had been a while since he set foot there.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 2E V3</Title>
            <Text>The bus groaned. It clanked beneath the floorboards like a piggy bank, accompanied by the rhythmic squeaking of the old suspension every time they hit a bump.
The seats creaked whenever someone shifted their weight. Somewhere near the back, a bolt was loose—it rattled faintly with every turn.
Overhead, the air conditioner wheezed out cool air in pitiful, uneven bursts. It clicked now and then, like it was trying to restart itself but kept giving up. 
The whole vehicle smelled faintly of dust and dried grass. 
Eddie sat near the window, his crutch propped beside him, fingers loosely gripping the handle. The metal of it was warm to the touch from sitting in the sunlight. His leg ached dully from the vibrations in the floor.
It was a week after his admission to Edenfield Infirmary, the nurses decided to let him go, since he looked more fine than ever, (and with Ashley and Will visiting too often, it gets really rowdy) and so he decided to leave and take his weekend somewhere.
Outside, the usual bustle of Edenfield is starting to give way to open fields. The noise of city life—the chatter of street vendors, the distant clanging of bells, the squeals of tram brakes—had long since faded, replaced by the subtle hum of wind brushing over fields.
He leaned against the cool windowpane and let his eyes drift to the hills outside.
The note crinkled faintly in his hand as he turned it over again.
21st Norwood Street. Past the Campground. Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.
Madeleine’s handwriting was neat, almost too neat—like every letter had been shaped with care.
He could’ve ignored it.
Midterms were over. Will was back to his stacks of books. Ashley had thrown herself into her advocacy group again, fighting for student protections and probably brewing some conspiracy after everything that happened to him.
He could’ve gone back to the Book Pirates, argued about the latest book they’d smuggled in from the restricted section. He’d even drafted a rant about the plot holes in The Alchemist’s Mirror.
And yet, here he was.
Why?
Because of a hunch? Because of that thing that chased him—crawling on all fours with arms too long and a face that didn’t look human?
Or maybe because of her.
He let out a slow breath and leaned his head against the window. The glass was warm.
She’d been patient with him. Even when she caught him that one time—slipping a book from the library.
Who was he kidding?
She was kind to everyone. That was just who she was.
Eddie looked outside again. The golden fields started to thin. In their place, narrow rivers carved winding paths through the land, glinting in the sunlight. Trees—tall, broad, and old—appeared more frequently now, rising from mossy rocks and thick underbrush. Their branches cast flickering shadows that danced across the windows as the bus rattled along the dirt path, it reminds him of home.
The road dipped and groaned under the weight of the vehicle. Somewhere beneath Eddie’s seat, a loose panel clattered like it might fall off. Still, he kept his eyes forward.
The bus finally creaked to a stop before a worn wooden cabin that sat nestled beneath a wide oak tree. A crooked sign swung gently in the breeze above the door.
Norwood Campgrounds.
Eddie looked at the paper again, unfolding it like he hadn’t memorized every inch of it.
21st Norwood Street, past the campground.
Right, this must be it.
With a grunt, he pressed a hand to the metal frame of the seat in front of him and hoisted himself up. His angle protested instantly.
“Stupid… thing,” Eddie cursed at his own leg, “Should’ve waited a few more days.”
The aisle felt narrower than usual. He shuffled past the rows of empty seats, his hand dragging along the backs of them for balance, his body swaying with the uneven ground beneath the bus.
Gravel crunched under his foot. The scent of pine hit him immediately—strong, earthy, and damp. Somewhere nearby, birds were chirping, and the wind whistled gently through the leaves like a whisper.
Eddie took a few slow steps forward, scanning the area. Past the bus stop and Norwood Campgrounds cabin, there wasn’t much—just a scattering of wooden buildings, most of them locked up, a picnic table or two, and a lonely clothesline swaying in the breeze. Beyond that, just trees. Trees and shadows. Tall and thick, the kind that swallowed noise and direction.
He turned the note over in his hand again.
&quot;Past the campground,&quot; it said. 
Past where? 
There was nothing here but locked-up cabins and trees that swallowed the light. After ten minutes of limping down a trail that led nowhere and getting confused looks from the few campers he saw, irritation began to prickle under his skin. He came to a stop by a large oak, leaning heavily on his crutch. His leg throbbed, his shirt was sticking to his back, and he was starting to feel like an idiot. Maybe this was all just a test. Or worse, a joke.
He came to a slow stop by a large oak tree, breathing hard. His leg was sore, his shirt was sticking to his back, and he was starting to wonder if this had all been a mistake. Maybe Madeleine had been joking. Or testing him. Or maybe—
“Edward!”
The voice cut through the woods like a warm gust of air. He froze, eyes scanning the brush and the winding paths around him.
Again, “Edward!”
He turned just in time to see a figure emerging between two trees—wavy red hair catching the sunlight like a flicker of fire, arms waving above her head.
Madeleine.
She jogged toward him, boots thudding softly against the dirt path, a wide smile on her face.
“You made it!” she called, beaming.
Before he could respond, she closed the distance and moved to wrap her arms around him. She caught herself halfway, her eyes darting to his crutch and the way he held his body stiffly. Her wide smile softened into a look of immediate concern. 
“Agh—crap—my leg!” Eddie winced, half-laughing, half-wheezing.
Madeleine immediately pulled back, her eyes wide. “Oh no! I’m so sorry—I didn’t know you were still healing!” 
He waved it off, trying to catch his breath. “No, no, it’s fine—just… a bit too soon for a bear hug, y’know?”
Madeleine frowned, looking genuinely guilty. “You really should’ve waited a few more days. You didn't have to come all this way.” 
“What can I say,” Eddie said dryly. “Couldn’t pass up a chance to meet the fire-breathing, death-dealing dragons.”
He expected a laugh, but Madeleine just nodded thoughtfully toward the distant trees. “You’ll have to wait on the dragons, I’m afraid. The matriarch has a wing injury and we’re keeping the hatchling in the containment ward for observation.”
“Haha, yeah.” Eddie chuckled. Then paused. “Wait… you’re serious?”

-o-

The path they followed are narrow. Between rows upon rows of towering pine trees and giant rocks. The sunlight filtering through in golden slants. The silence of the woods was complete—except for the occasional chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves, and now and then, a distant, eerie wail from deeper in the forest.
“So…” Eddie opened, beginning to feel the silence, “How long have you been doing this? The Sanctuary thing.”
“Since my first year.” Her voice was calm, nostalgic. “I signed up as a volunteer the moment I arrived in Edenfield. But to be honest, it started long before that.”
“You grew up around these kind of stuff?”
“You could say that,” she said with a small laugh. “But not exactly, I was always obsessed with them. Reading about them. Drawing them. Pretending I had one hidden under my bed when I was little.” She slowed her pace a little, eyes scanning the path ahead. 
“There was one time,” She continued, “When I was maybe eight or nine—me and two of my best friends were playing by the creek near my place. We stumbled on this injured hatchling. Tiny thing. Could barely stand. It must’ve gotten separated from its flock.”
Eddie listened, the rhythmic thud of his crutch tapping the dirt between her words.
“We couldn’t tell our parents,” she continued. “They’d have made us give it up right away. Said it was too dangerous. So we took turns sneaking out food and blankets. One of us would always be on watch while the others fed it and tend to its wing.”
“It took almost a year.” She smiled, “But one day, it just stood up, flapped its wings, and took off. Just like that. No warning. No goodbye. He’s Just… gone.”
“Didn’t that… I don’t know… Hurt?” Eddie asked.
“What do you mean?” Madeleine asked back.
“I don’t know…” Eddie said, “Taking care of something for almost a year. You must’ve grown attached to that thing, you know?”
Madeleine shook her head. “Some people say letting go is painful. But I didn’t feel that way. It’s just that the feeling I felt finally seeing them fly again outweights the feeling I felt when they left. Seeing it soar… If felt as if we did something good, and that was enough.”
They walked in silence for a few more steps.
Eddie looked at her. “That’s a lot of heart for an eight-year-old.”
“I don’t think it was heart.” Madeleine smiled at him. “It was hope.”

-o-

They walked for some time, the path narrowing until it became little more than a trail of flattened leaves and twisted roots. Eventually, Madeleine veered off the track, motioning for Eddie to follow her. He hesitated for a moment, then sighed and limped after her into a quiet clearing surrounded by towering trees.
At the far end of the clearing stood two trees unlike any Eddie had seen before. They were impossibly tall, ancient, their gnarled trunks wide enough to fit a whole bus between them. Roots like thick ropes coiled at their bases, and their dark green canopies loomed high above the rest of the forest like silent sentinels.
Eddie stood in the middle of the clearing, taking in the sheer scale of them.
Madeleine, meanwhile, walked toward the space between the trees. She paced to and fro in front of them, scanning the area.
“What are you doing?” Eddie called.
Madeleine squinted at the ground, then up at the trunks. “Someone must’ve closed the gate.”
“The what?”
“Did you bring a wand?”
“I umm… no, I don’t have any.”
She winced. “Right. Of course, sorry I forgot you’re in Alchemy. I don’t have mine either.”
With a resigned sigh, Madeleine stepped up to one of the trees and began patting the bark, feeling around the grooves like someone searching for a hidden latch. After a few moments, she let out a soft “Ah-ha!” and pulled something free from a hollow in the bark.
It was a staff—twisted wood woven into a lattice, with a simple, clouded crystal embedded at the top. The whole thing looked as if it had grown that way.
Madeleine approached the first tree and tapped it once with the staff. Then she crossed over to the other and did the same.
Finally, she returned to Eddie’s side, held the staff upright, and brought its base down against the earth with a soft thunk.
At first, nothing happened.
Then, high above, something stirred.
Eddie looked up just in time to see a thick branch from one tree curl inward like a bending arm. The other tree responded in kind. The two branches reached across the empty space between them and interlocked, forming a curved archway of living wood.
And beneath that arch, the world changed.
Where moments ago there had only been trees and brambles, now stood an open expanse of green fields stretching gently toward the horizon. A wooden fence traced the edge of a nearby pasture, and beyond it were low cabins with mossy roofs, a few smoke trails curling lazily from chimneys. The scent of hay and something vaguely sulfurous wafted from the invisible threshold.
Eddie blinked. “That’s… new.”
Madeleine grinned. “Welcome to the Edenfield Mythical Creature Sanctuary.”

            <Title>The Magic Well</Title>
            <Text>The Well of Illyria

The Magic in Edenfield comes from the Well of Illyria, that resides in the Holy Capital of Illyria

The Country of Illyria resides between the country of Solivia and Gwyndorith, a small city sized country that is ruled by the Archdeacon and its Wellkeepers

The city is built on a crater, on the crater, there are islands of different cities built on top of it, there are bridges and elevators leading up to different floating islands in Illyria

But on the depth of its crater, there is a holy building

The Holy Keep

Where inside, there is a huge well, it still made of ancient stone… Pre-historic people made the stone well back then

On top of the Well, there are two stone half-moon shaped seal, a kind of gate, that is slightly closing the well

From the Well, it emits a strong blue ish energy upwards that shot up, into the crater above, to the islands above, and into the entire continent… into the atmosphere of earth itself

That… is where Magic came from, beyond the Well, there might be The Arcane.

Nobody knew what is beneath the Well, what history knows that if the Well is opened more, more magical energy surges, more power

The more it closes, the less magical energy there are in the world

For now, it is partially closed. And for ages, magic has been in balance between good and evil.

The Wellkeepers are always in a council, thinking about the state of the Well, and when to open it, when to close it

The Wellkeepers are blind, only guided by the voices and commands of the Arcane and the Archdeacon.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 14</Title>
            <Text>The group continued their journey into the forest. The trees ahead seemed to part, and Eddie noticed a faint, golden glow peeking through the gaps.
And then Catherine stopped abruptly.
&quot;There it is!&quot; Catherine stopped abruptly,  Eddie, Markus and eventually Torrie bumped into her like a domino. She gestured toward the center of the clearing.
“What?!” Eddie hissed, looking annoyed. “You could’ve told us to stop, you know—“
“We have arrived at the gate!” Catherine said with a fluorish
As Eddie stepped to the side to look at what in front of Catherine, he saw it.
At the heart of the space was a patch of delicate yellow flowers, their petals arranged in a near-perfect circle. They seemed to shimmer faintly, catching and reflecting light that wasn’t visible to the naked eye.
“Whoa,” Eddie finally said in awe, “I think I’ve seen those before.”
“Of course you have,” Catherine said with a smirk, “These are Eden Flowers!”
The group then gets closer to the clearing, as they arrive at the clearing, the darkness began to encapsulate them, save for the faint glow of the Eden Flowers at their center.
&quot;Eden Flowers,&quot; Catherine murmured, kneeling beside them. Her hands brushed lightly over the petals, careful not to disturb their fragile beauty. &quot;I didn’t think I’d find them here of all places.&quot;
Torrie dropped to her knees beside Catherine, &quot;Are they a special flower, Aunt Catherine?&quot; she asked, her voice filled with wonder.
&quot;They are here,” Catherine said, “But not in a city called Edenfield where they’re from. But in ancient times, they were widely cultivated. Eden Flowers are incredibly receptive to magic—ideal for enchantments, alchemical transmutations, and even energy storage. These might have been planted centuries ago, perhaps by one of the Nine Sages themselves.&quot;
“I think I’ve seen Mr. Welton use some of them for his remedies,” Markus said, “They are potent.”
“The namesake of the city of Edenfield too, right?” Eddie said, sombre.
&quot;You are correct,&quot; Catherine replied, her voice tinged with admiration. &quot;This was their legacy. A flower that could shape entire eras of magic. And now... we need them to guide us through this place.&quot;
She stood, brushing the dirt from her white dress’s skirt. &quot;I’ll prepare a transmutation circle to reveal a safe path. But first, I’ll need light. The process will eliminate the faint glow of the Eden Flowers.&quot;
“Sure,” Eddie glanced at Markus. &quot;Got a flashlight, Mark?&quot;
“Oh, sure.” Markus said, then tapped at his jacket, then at his satchel… 
Then his backpack… his expression is grim as he looked back to Eddie, 
“Oh, damn it. I think I left it back at the brewing room.&quot;
&quot;You’re joking.&quot; 
&quot;Sorry.” Markus scratched the back of his head, his sheepish grin doing little to help. “I thought the forest would provide enough glow.&quot;
“Well,” Catherine sighed, “Maybe a few moments of darkness wouldn’t hurt, does it?”
“But I’m afraid of the dark!” Torrie plead, “Also what if there is a monster behind us?!”
“Look it’s alright, Torrie.” Eddie said, putting his hand on Torrie’s shoulder
“Alright…” Catherine said, “Here I go…”
Catherine took her staff and pierced it to the dirt below, her staff tracing elegant, sweeping arcs across the ground. Her movements fluid like dances, as she wove intricate patterns into the soil. 
The transmutation circle began to take shape, an intricate fusion of artistry and precision. The elven language spiraled outward. 
Interwoven with the runes were geometric designs of a distinctly foreign origin, their angular lines and curved edges forming a perfect harmony with the fluid Elven script. It was a style originating from the Far East, known for its symmetry and balance, and it added an otherworldly mysticism to the circle. 
The group watched Catherine at work in silence, the clearing lit only by the fading glow of the Eden Flowers. 
Torrie stood close to Eddie, her hands gripping the edge of his coat tightly. Her wide eyes darted nervously to the growing shadows around them, the encroaching darkness pressing in like a living thing.
&quot;I don’t like this,&quot; Torrie whispered, her voice trembling. &quot;It’s too dark. What if something’s out there?&quot;
Eddie glanced down at his little sister. Her fear palpable; the way her fingers clutched his coat. She was trying to be brave, but the darkness seemed to stretch endlessly around them, and the faint rustle of leaves only deepened her unease.
Sensing, her fear, Eddie sighed. Torrie is always afraid of the dark, there is no other way to get light it seems.
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Eddie muttered, relenting. &quot;I’ve got this.&quot;
He reached into Torrie’s backpack, pulling out a wand that had been tucked away among her belongings. The wood was plain, its surface worn smooth from years of use, but as Eddie held it, a faint warmth spread through his fingers, familiar and comforting.
He focused on the gunpowder he carried on his satchel, channeling its latent energy into the spell. 
A small flame ignited at the tip of the wand, flickering and dancing in the growing darkness. The warm, golden light illuminated Torrie’s face, chasing away the shadows and softening the lines of worry etched across her features.
&quot;There,&quot; Eddie said, holding the wand low next to Torrie. The firelight illuminated Torrie and the flowers, “Happy now?”
Torrie nodded quickly, her grip on his coat loosening. &quot;Yeah... thanks,&quot; she said softly, her voice still a little shaky but steadier than before.
The firelight cast dancing shadows across their faces and glinted off the edges of Catherine’s transmutation circle. 
Catherine paused, stepping back to admire her handiwork with a satisfied smile. The flowers themselves seemed to shimmer faintly, their golden hues complementing the firelight of Eddie’s spell.
&quot;You’ve still got it, huh?&quot; Markus taps his elbow towards Eddie. 
&quot;It’s just a light.” Eddie shrugged, avoiding Markus’s gaze. “Torrie’s scared of the dark, and nobody else had one handy.&quot;
Catherine clapped her hands, drawing their attention back to her. &quot;Alright, folks,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s going to be dark for a while, so stick close.&quot;
She knelt at the center of the intricately etched transmutation circle, her staff resting lightly across her knees. 
She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply as the clearing fell silent.
Rustling leaves and distant chirps fading into an almost oppressive quiet. 
For a moment, it seemed as though nothing would happen.
Then, subtly at first, the glow of the surrounding Eden Flowers began to dim. Their golden radiance, a natural luminescence that had lit the forest edge, flickered faintly before extinguishing one by one. 
The clearing plunged into total darkness, save for the flickering orange light of Eddie’s wand, its fire casting long, shifting shadows over the group and the inert circle.
Torrie clung to Eddie’s arm, her wide eyes darting nervously around the shadowed clearing. 
But then, a faint hum broke through the darkness—a deep, resonant vibration that seemed to pulse from the earth itself. 
The Eden Flowers' glow began to return, but not to their blossoms. Instead, their golden light streamed toward the transmutation circle, like threads of liquid light weaving their way into its grooves and runes.
A wave of energy burst outward from Catherine’s transmutation circle, a ripple of power that swept over the clearing, rustling the leaves and sending a chill upwards. 
At first Eddie was wondering what those forces was, why is it coming seemingly from underneath the transmutation circle?
But then he remembered, it was mana.
The runes etched into the dirt ignited, glowing with an otherworldly golden glow that once emitted from the Eden Flowers.
Catherine remained still at the center, her posture serene even as the manas enveloped her. Her short, apple-red hair began to rise, defying gravity as if lifted by an unseen force. 
The light of the circle reflected in her closed eyes, and her expression was one of deep concentration, her connection to the magic undeniable.
The glow reached its zenith, the clearing bathed in shimmering golden light, before it began to subside. The runes dimmed. 
Their golden glow ebbing away until the circle was dark once more. The clearing returned to the stillness it once was, the only light now coming from Eddie’s spell.
“Eddie, look!” Torrie said, pointing to the dark bushes ahead.
Eddie looks towards the spot she pointed, then,  just as quickly as the glow had faded, a new light appeared.
It was soft, golden, and steady. A single Eden Flower ahead of them began to glow again, brighter than before. 
Another followed.
Then another.
The blossoms igniting one by one in a line that stretched forward into the dark forest.
The flowers formed two parallel rows, their light creating a luminous pathway that cut through the shadows. 
In the center of the now-dormant transmutation circle, the Eden Flower glowed softly, its light flickering before returning to its natural state. 
Catherine opened her eyes and took in the sight before her, a wide smile spreading across her face.
&quot;The Forest has granted us safe passage through the Traveller’s Path,&quot; she said, her voice brimming with satisfaction and awe. 
She rose gracefully, brushing dirt from her dress’s white skirt. 
&quot;What are we waiting for?&quot;

            <Text>- On Act 2, Eddie will meet with the Alamirian Merchants again, they are three brothers, or two

- One of them is especially pissed, but they are the scholars who wanted to study the Artefact

- Please brainstorm more on the artefact for the love of god

- Maybe its something that enables an Alchemist to make modifications on a biological body

The ARTEFACT is something to do with Biological Transmutation, which the Three Scholars are very intrigued because it can revolutionise the medical field, and how the healers can heal wounds twice as fast, with little to no recovery time!

	The ARTEFACT, too, is also sought after by an underground organisation, sought after for its secret of Biological Transmutation, if they can bend biological matter, they can once again, rediscover the arts of Chimaera Making, and if so possible, Human-Chimaera Making, in which, not only will give them Beasts that can fight for them, but Super Soldiers with immense strength

	Naturally, The Scholars wants Eddie to keep it a secret from anyone, not everyone shall knows about it.

But he eventually Told Will and Ashley about it, because he feel like can’t hold it anymore

Will maybe told Walther

Walther is from the underground organisation, he stole the Artefact

It is a mystery onwars, The Artefact is lost at MIDPOINT, Eddie and the Scholars is in distress

Eventually from red-herrings that points to Will, it is evident, that Walther took the ARTEFACT</Text>

            <Text>From Catherine or an Elf
“You are no different than me. There are no difference between an Elf, a Mortal and a Dwarf.”
“People thought that Elves are the sons and daughters of the gods. Sent to these lands as an exemplary, as a guides to the Mortals of this world. They thought they were so high up, a diety, some societies even godifies us.”
“We are no different than Mortals. We came from the same ancestors. We grew longer and sharper ears because we dwell in the deep roofed forest of Lunaria, we have sharper visions because we have to navigate through the darkness, we are natural at magic because that was what abundant in Lunaria. We are immortal because our ancestors diet consisted of an extinct fruit that have regenerative properties.”
“It’s funny, really. We are immortals, but we cease to become so when we procreate, our evolution works against us.” </Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose either of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “All files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 28 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Upon entering the courtyard, Eddie paused, captured by the enchanting scene before him. The space was a serene haven bursting with colourful flowerbeds of delicate daisies, fragrant lavender, and ethereal bluebells. Some flowers shimmered as if kissed by stardust. At the same time, an aromatic herb garden filled the air with the comforting scents of fresh basil and rosemary. 

His gaze was drawn to Catherine. She stood amidst the blooms, wearing a hospital gown that mirrored his own. Her broken alchemical staff, once a ruin after their encounter in the Deep Glaive, had been magically restored. The weld marks hint at her skill. She held it close to the flowers. Eddie watched in awe as the blooms seemed to respond to her presence. Flourishing as if she were watering them with magic. 

As Catherine gently fed the magical flowers with her energy. They began to bloom even brighter, a testament to her alchemical prowess and deep connection to nature. It was like she was sharing a part of herself with the garden. Fostering growth and vitality in this enchanting space. 

Eddie took a step closer, his heart swelling with admiration. Here was Catherine, a master of her craft, weaving her magic into the fabric of life around her. The courtyard felt alive with energy, and all his worries melted away for a moment. 

&quot;Catherine,&quot; he called softly, breaking the tranquillity. 

She turned, a warm smile spreading across her face. &quot;Eddie! You're awake!&quot; 

He couldn't help but smile back, feeling the comfort of their friendship envelop him like a warm embrace. &quot;Yeah, thanks to some good company,&quot; he replied. Gesturing toward the vibrant flowers around her. 

Catherine chuckled, her eyes sparkling with mischief. 

&quot;Come, let's go for a walk,&quot; Catherine suggested. Her voice light as she began to stroll along one of the winding paths in the courtyard. 

Eddie fell in step beside her, taking in the vibrant surroundings. The bubbling water from the fountain filled the air, mingling with the soft rustle of leaves. He turned to Catherine, curiosity bubbling up inside him. &quot;What happened after I passed out? I mean, why did I even pass out in the first place?&quot; 

Catherine sighed, her expression shifting to something more serious. &quot;You fainted during our walk back. Markus gave you some painkilling sedatives to help with your injuries, but they can only last so long. We thought it best to bring you here for proper care.&quot; 

Eddie nodded, absorbing her words. &quot;And you? What happened to your arm?&quot; 

Catherine glanced down at her sling, her lips curling into a wry smile. &quot;Oh, that's a little more embarrassing. I might have overexerted myself while trying to fend off the Nightingale Fox. In the heat of the moment, I wasn't as careful as I should've been.&quot; She paused for a beat, her eyes twinkling with mischief. &quot;Actually, it wasn't the fox that got me.&quot; 

Eddie raised an eyebrow, confused. &quot;Then what?&quot; 

Eddie couldn't help but laugh, feeling the weight of his worries about Catherine's condition lighten. Despite the bruising encounter with his mother, it was clear Catherine had survived it all with her characteristic humour intact. 

As they strolled through the courtyard, Eddie and Catherine fell into a rhythm of playful banter. Reminiscent of their earlier days. Though Eddie had matured, he couldn't help but engage in their familiar teasing. 

&quot;Now, what are you going to do with it back?&quot; Catherine asked, lightly tapping the bottom of her staff against Eddie's pant pocket. 

&quot;Have what back?&quot; Eddie replied, feigning innocence. 

&quot;Your ring,&quot; she said, her tone teasing. &quot;That thing is no more than a piece of antique junk if you're just going to keep it like that.&quot; 

Eddie chuckled and pulled the ring from his pocket, examining its wood and crystal. &quot;I don't know. Maybe I'll help Mom and Dad more with the magical stuff,&quot; he said, a hint of uncertainty creeping into his voice. 

Catherine's playful demeanour shifted, a more serious glint appearing in her eyes. &quot;Eddie, listen. You have talent. If you're going to hold onto that ring, you should do something meaningful with it. You shouldn't just let it gather dust.&quot; 

He met her gaze, feeling the weight of her words. &quot;I'm not sure I'm ready for anything serious,&quot; he admitted. 

As they continued walking through the courtyard. Catherine's expression shifted. A glint of something thoughtful appeared in her eyes. She paused for a moment, looking out at the trees as if she were piecing together a memory. &quot;You know,&quot; she said casually, &quot;I remember when I first arrived in Weshaven. You told me you were off to university—Edenfield, right? Big dreams and all that.&quot; 

Eddie winced, feeling the weight of the lie he'd told her back then. His hands tightened around the ring in his pocket. &quot;I know, I know,&quot; he muttered, frustration creeping into his voice. &quot;I know I shouldn't have lied. I didn't go to any university. I'm not on any sort of scholarship. I'm just a kid expelled from a magic academy and stuck in his father's shop, that's all.&quot; 

Catherine's eyes softened, but there was a firmness in her voice as she spoke. &quot;That's not what I meant, Eddie.&quot; She paused, 

Catherine is stepping closer to him, her tone dropping lower, more serious. &quot;Do you want to pursue that for real?&quot; 

Eddie stopped, his heart skipping a beat. He turned to face her. Expecting some kind of punchline. Catherine always had a way of lightening the mood with a joke, especially when things got too serious. But this time, there was no joke. Her gaze was unwavering, the kind of seriousness he didn't often see from her. 

The silence hung between them, and Eddie was at a loss for words. For a moment, it felt like his entire past, failures, and doubts were standing before him. Laid bare for Catherine to see. He had always been good at deflecting, hiding behind humour or charm, but this was different. She was asking him a question that required more than just an answer—it was a question about his future, his choice to really face what lay ahead. 
Eddie shifted his weight from one foot to the other, a knot forming in his stomach. He opened his mouth, but no words came out. What could he say? That he wanted to be someone more than the disappointment he felt he was? That he could really see himself pursuing magic again after everything?
He let out a long sigh. &quot;I don't know. I haven't exactly given it much thought lately.&quot; He paused, then looked her in the eye.
Catherine stood there, her gaze softer than before. “Hmm, I suppose you’re right.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard. For a moment, he thought he’d misheard her. Catherine… agreeing with him? Not pushing, not nudging, not prodding him with yet another half-hearted motivational speech? His confusion deepened as she turned and began walking again.
“I’m sorry,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but steady. “I suppose these past few weeks I’ve been pushing you too hard. ‘Eddie, why not this, why not that,’” she added with a faint chuckle, shaking her head. “I’ve been so caught up in what I think is best for you that I didn’t stop to think how much it might’ve hurt you.”
Eddie stood rooted to the spot, watching her walk ahead. The words settled over him like a weight—heavy and suffocating. She had finally given up. After all her pushing, nagging, and coaxing, she was done.
And for the first time, the thought of Catherine stopping felt far worse than any of her nagging ever had.
This is it, Eddie thought, his chest tightening. This is how it happens. You stop arguing, you stop trying, and you go back to the apothecary, back to Weshaven, back to—
Back to a mundane life.
She turned and continued walking, her pace unhurried. Eddie trailed behind her, the weight in his chest growing heavier with every step.
“There’s nothing wrong with staying here in Weshaven, I suppose.” Catherine went on, her voice soft, almost wistful. “It’s quaint, beautiful, calm. And being an apothecary here, in the middle of all this… I think there is nothing wrong with it.”
No.
The word struck him like a thunderclap, reverberating through his entire being.
No, There is something wrong with that, in fact, it’s wrong to him.
His feet moved before his mind caught up. He stepped forward, his voice rising before he could second-guess himself.
“That’s what’s wrong for me, Catherine!” Eddie interrupted, his voice breaking as he stopped in his tracks.
She stopped and turned, surprised by the sudden outburst.
“It’s wrong for me to just stay here and pretend this is enough,” he said, his voice trembling. “It’s wrong for me to give up on Alchemy—the one thing I’ve ever been truly passionate about! Do you know what it feels like to love something so much it’s all you think about? I can’t stop seeing the formulas in my head, dreaming about what I could create, what I could become. It’s like a fire inside me, and every day I stay here, it dims just a little more.”
His voice cracked, but he pushed through, the words spilling out as if he’d been holding them back for years.
“I’ve spent so much time lying to everyone—my parents, my friends, you—and pretending I don’t care, but I do. I care so much it hurts. I can’t keep pretending that this… this little life here in Weshaven is what I want. It’s not. It’s never been enough.”
Catherine’s eyes softened, her lips parting as if to speak, but Eddie didn’t let her.
“And you know what’s worst of all?” His voice dropped to a near-whisper. “I’ve been lying to myself. Telling myself I can be happy here, that I can make this work. But I can’t. Because deep down, I know who I am, and I know what I want. I don’t want to be an apothecary. I don’t want to stay in this quiet, deadbeat hamlet, watching the years slip away.”
He looked at her, his expression filled with a mixture of desperation and resolve.
“It’s wrong for me to give up on my dreams, Catherine. It’s wrong for me to not go to Edenfield.”
The courtyard fell silent, save for the faint rustle of leaves in the breeze. Eddie stood there, his chest heaving as if he’d just run a great distance. For the first time in years, he felt the weight on his shoulders lift, replaced by a flicker of hope.
Eddie pressed forward, his steps heavy, his outburst echoing in his own ears. He didn’t look back at Catherine, too embarrassed by the rawness he’d just exposed.
“Sorry for the outburst,” he muttered, trying to sound nonchalant, though his voice wavered. “But I guess it’s all too late now, isn’t it?”
“It is not,” Catherine replied firmly, her voice carrying an undeniable conviction as she quickly caught up to him.
Eddie stopped, turning his head just enough to glance at her. He scoffed bitterly, shoving his hands into his pockets. “The recommendation letter for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship has expired, Catherine,” he said, his tone biting, though the bitterness was clearly aimed at himself. “What should I do? Walk in with an expired recommendation letter from seven years ago and beg for them to take me back?”
Catherine grinned slyly, the corners of her mouth quirking up as she tilted her head. “I don’t know,” she said, her tone playful. “I guess you could make that work.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard by her lightheartedness. “What are you—”
Before he could finish, Catherine reached into the pocket of her medical gown, her movements deliberate yet casual. From it, she withdrew a gleaming brass card, holding it up between two fingers. The metallic surface caught the sunlight, casting a faint shimmer.
Eddie’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the object. He stepped closer, his curiosity overriding his frustration. The brass card bore Catherine’s name etched in elegant script, alongside an intricate alchemical symbol: a circle intertwined with a rectangle and a triangle.
“Tell them I sent you,” Catherine said, her voice steady, almost daring him to argue.
Eddie froze, staring at the card, the weight of her words sinking in. “Catherine… what is this?”
“It’s my recommendation,” she explained, her tone softening. “I may not be the head of the Sage’s Institute, but I’ve got enough credibility in Alchemy circles that they’ll have to think twice before dismissing you. An expired recommendation? That’s nothing. Not when they see this.”
His fingers twitched, and he reached out hesitantly, as if the brass card might vanish if he moved too quickly. When he finally took it, he felt the cool, smooth metal against his palm. It was heavier than he expected, carrying not just its physical weight but also the weight of her belief in him.
“You… you’d really do this for me?” Eddie asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Of course,” Catherine said, her expression softening into something more genuine. “I’ve seen what you can do, Eddie. I know how much Alchemy means to you. And if you want this, if you really want to go to Edenfield, then I’ll stand by you. You’re not alone in this.”
Eddie’s throat tightened, and for a moment, he couldn’t find the words. He looked at the card again, then back at Catherine, who gave him an encouraging nod.
“Thank you,” he said finally,
“Don’t thank me yet,” Catherine replied with a smirk. “You’ve still got a long road ahead.”
Eddie held the brass card tightly, a sense of determination reigniting within him. For the first time in years, the dream that felt so distant now seemed just within reach.

            <Title>Chapter 4E_V2</Title>
            <Text>Madeleine rushed down the stone corridors of the Alchemy Faculty building, the sound of her boots echoing off the walls as she hurried toward her Herbology lab. Her satchel bounced against her side with each step, and she barely spared a glance at the enchanted timepiece hanging from her belt, the hands rapidly ticking past the minutes. She had completely lost track of time.
Damn it, Madeleine, she thought, how did I let this happen?
She hadn’t meant to lose track of time. But between her backlog of Herbology assignments and the scrawled notes she’d been poring over—notes about the tiger, about Eddie, about that eerie resemblance—it had all started to unravel. Something about it gnawed at her, a puzzle missing its center.
She turned sharply down a narrow hallway, nearly colliding with a floating cart of flasks.
Focus.
One thing at a time.
The heavy oaken door to the Herbology lab loomed ahead, carved with ivy and curling vines that shimmered faintly in the light. As she reached for the handle, her heart pounded—half from the run, half from the fear that she was already too late.
But the soft murmur of voices inside met her ears, and when she eased the door open, she exhaled with relief.
The professor wasn’t here yet.
Inside, students clustered in groups, tending to glass terrariums, adjusting runic lighting, or arguing softly over pruning techniques. The scent of damp moss and pollen clung to the air like mist.
Madeleine slipped inside quietly, closing the heavy door behind her with a soft click. She scanned the room quickly, eyes darting over the clusters of students and their green, glowing plants, until they settled on a familiar figure near the back. Walther sat hunched over his workstation, his fingers moving steadily across a piece of parchment covered in neat, looping script.
Without hesitation, Madeleine crossed the room and slid into the chair beside him. The moment her weight settled, the door creaked again—Professor’s arrival—and the low hum of anticipation rippled through the lab.
Walther looked up briefly, his dark eyes narrowing as he took in the flushed, breathless expression on her face. “Madeleine, you’re late,” he said, voice quiet but edged with mild amusement. “You’re usually the first one here. What kept you? Another marathon at the Sanctuary?”
She swallowed, forcing a tired smile. “Something like that.”
She didn’t want to say more, especially not here—not with half the class listening and Walther’s perceptive gaze pressing gently but firmly.
Instead, she nodded toward his parchment. “What are you working on?”
Walther’s lips twitched into a rare, almost-smile. “Just some notes on the growth patterns of the Shadeleaf vine. It’s been acting… unusual lately. I thought you’d want to know.”
Madeleine’s eyes flickered to the vine creeping near their workstation, its dark leaves twisting strangely toward the light. “Unusual how?”
He shrugged, but there was a tension beneath the movement. “Hard to say. I’ll show you later. For now, just keep an eye on it.”
She nodded again, grateful for the shift in focus. Here, at least, was a small fragment of normality.
The professor’s voice cut through the murmurs, drawing everyone’s attention. “Today, we will be testing hypotheses on the growth behaviors of Luminara nox, a plant known for its bioluminescent properties in low-light environments. Your assignment is to observe and record the plant’s response to varied light frequencies. You may begin.”
Madeleine nodded absently, still feeling the weight of sleepless nights and the gnawing mystery at the back of her mind. She reached down to her satchel to pull out her binders, intending to get her notes ready.
But as she yanked the bag up hastily, her tired fingers slipped. Instead of the binder’s sturdy spine, her grip caught the loose papers tucked behind it. In an instant, a flurry of parchment spiraled out, fluttering down like autumn leaves across the stone floor.
“Oh, no,” Madeleine muttered under her breath, cheeks flushing as she crouched to gather the scattered sheets.
Walther, sitting beside her, was already reaching down to help, his calm presence a quiet anchor amid her embarrassment. “Here,” he said softly, handing her a few papers with an easy efficiency.
“Thanks,” she murmured, biting her lip as she carefully stacked them back into the binder.
Madeleine crouched, carefully gathering the scattered papers with Walther’s steady help. Each sheet slipped back into her binder brought a small wave of relief. Almost all of it was accounted for—except one.
Her eyes followed Walther’s gaze as he held a single page between his fingers. His expression shifted sharply, a flicker of something like horror mixed with disbelief crossing his usually unreadable face.
“Walther?” Madeleine’s voice was low but urgent. “Can you give me that?”
He didn’t say a word, his fingers tightening around the paper as if it burned him. Her heart quickened, unease prickling beneath her skin.
With a quick tug, she yanked the page from his grasp, pulling it closer to her. Her breath caught as she recognized the sketch sprawled across the parchment.
It was the drawing she’d made—the detailed, haunting sketch Eddie had described to her of the tiger-human chimaera.
Madeleine’s pulse hammered in her ears as Walther’s wide eyes met hers, his usual calm shattered for a fleeting moment. She quickly hid the paper beneath her binder, forcing her voice steady.
“Where did you...?”
Walther’s lips pressed into a thin line, eyes darkening. For the first time, the mysterious distance around him felt like something more—something dangerous.
Madeleine swallowed, her secret suddenly feeling heavier than ever. 

-o-

The moon hung low over Edenfield’s towering spires, its silver glow pooling on the cobbled pathways. Lanterns flickered in the cold breeze as Madeleine stepped out of the Alchemy building, tugging her scarf tighter and buttoning her coat all the way up to her chin. The night bit at her cheeks, and the long day pressed against her shoulders like a weight.
She was halfway down the steps when she heard it.
“Madeleine.”
She turned, catching sight of Walther’s figure leaning against one of the columns, his silhouette long and still under the lanternlight.
“Oh, hey,” she said, flashing her usual warm smile despite the late hour and her exhaustion. “What’s up?”
Walther stepped closer. “I wanted to ask you something,” he said, his voice quieter than usual, but no less firm. “That sketch you dropped earlier… where did you get the idea for it?”
Madeleine hesitated for a breath too long. Her mind spun.
“Just... something I threw together,” she said lightly, tucking her hands into her coat pockets. “A badly drawn South Alamirian Tiger, honestly. It’s not exactly accurate.”
Walther didn’t laugh. He didn’t even blink.
“You’re lying,” he said calmly. “Is this about Eddie? You think a South Alamirian Tiger attacked him?”
She glanced away, toward the line of trees swaying in the wind. “It’s just a hunch,” she admitted, careful with her words.
Walther stepped forward again, his brows lowering. “Madeleine, South Alamirian Tigers come from the eastern dunes. There hasn’t been one seen this far west in decades. Certainly not in Edenfield.”
Madeleine met his gaze. Her voice was quiet, but steady. “I know. That’s why I’m curious.”
A long pause hung between them, the cold wind threading between their words. Walther studied her with that same unreadable expression he always wore, but this time, something in his eyes looked sharper—cutting through the calm.
And yet, he said nothing more. 

-o-

Madeleine’s boots clicked softly on the stone path as she crossed the campus grounds, the foggy air curling around her like ghostly ribbons. Her scarf was pulled tight around her neck, and she buttoned her coat all the way up, her gloved hands tucked into her sleeves to fend off the creeping cold.
The lamplight from the faculty buildings spilled in golden puddles onto the walkway, but the rest of Edenfield was dim and quiet—students tucked away in their dorms or libraries, the hum of campus life reduced to stillness.
She reached the bus stop at the edge of the quad, where the wrought-iron sign swayed slightly in the breeze. The enchanted schedule flickered faintly, glowing with runes that shifted to show Aetherell Reach – 6 min.
With a quiet sigh, Madeleine sat down on the bench, the cold seeping through the wooden slats. She leaned back and let her head tilt toward the sky, watching her breath fog in the moonlight. 
Her gaze drifted out across the empty road, unfocused.
But her thoughts didn’t stay still for long. They circled back—inevitably—to her conversation with Walther.
He’d acted strangely. Not obviously so, but off. She’d known him since the start of term, shared a lab bench with him more days than not. He was reliable. Reserved. Never the type to get worked up about… anything, let alone one of her messy drawings.
He had never shown the slightest interest in her sketches before. Never once asked her where she got her ideas, let alone stared at one like he’d seen a ghost.
Why today?
Then it hit her. Of course. Walther had mentioned in passing—once, maybe twice—that he was studying the anatomy and vascular structures of South Alamirian Tigers. That was probably why the drawing caught his eye. That had to be it.
Still, something didn’t sit right.
She sat up straighter, her fingers curling against her knees. Wait.
Walther volunteered at the Sanctuary. But unlike her—who cleaned enclosures, administered salves, handled creature check-ups—Walther never worked in the physical sections. He was never on feeding duty, never in the recovery stables, never doing the dirty work. His role was… research. Always research.
He studied the creatures. Dissected their physiology through observation and notes. He didn’t care for them. He studied them.
And there was more. He volunteered with Edenfield’s Food Shelter Society. Madeleine remembered him saying that once, off-handedly, like it didn’t matter. They helped the city’s unhoused population. They delivered food, yes—but also went into places people didn’t like to talk about. Old tunnels, abandoned corners of the city. The underbelly.
Two things clicked. Then three. Then four.
Madeleine’s breath caught in her throat.
Research… deep anatomical knowledge… access to vulnerable populations… a strange, cold fascination with a creature that shouldn’t exist…
Her hand flew to her satchel, as if instinctively checking her sketches were still there.
Her face slowly paled, lips parting slightly as a horrible thought took shape. Not fully formed—but enough to cast a shadow over everything she’d been trying to ignore.
Could it be?
No. No, that’s insane… she told herself. But her gut didn’t agree. Her heart was thudding now, dull and fast beneath her scarf. The pieces didn’t fit perfectly—but they sat too close not to touch.
The wind picked up again, rustling the trees behind the shelter.
Madeleine stared ahead, her eyes wide, her breath held.
The bus rolled up in the distance. But she no longer felt the comfort of home awaiting her. Only a hollow, rising dread.

-o-

The bus hissed to a stop at the edge of Aetherell Reach. Madeleine didn’t wait for the doors to fully open before stepping down. She didn’t thank the driver—a small, almost sacred courtesy she never forgot. But tonight, it slipped her completely.
Her boots hit the pavement. Cold air bit at her cheeks.
She moved fast.
Only one thought screamed in her mind now: Call Claire.
If anyone could pull the others together on short notice, it was Claire—sharp, dependable Claire, who spent more time in the Edenfield Grand Library than most librarians. She would know how to reach Will, Ashley… and Eddie.
Madeleine spotted the phone booth at the corner just beyond the wrought-iron fence, tucked beneath a flickering lantern. She broke into a brisk jog, her satchel thudding against her side.
Fumbling the door open, she stepped inside, heart thumping in her throat. The glass was fogged from the cold, her breath blooming across the surface as she picked up the receiver with slightly trembling fingers.
She slipped a coin into the slot.
Dialled the number from memory.
The ring buzzed against her ear. Once. Twice.
C’mon, Claire. Please pick up.
Each second stretched taut, a string pulled tighter and tighter. Madeleine glanced over her shoulder through the fogged glass, as if expecting someone—or something—to be there.
The phone clicked.
“Hello?”
Madeleine exhaled in relief. “Claire. It’s me.”
“Madeleine? Is everything alright? You sound—”
“Listen,” she cut in, her voice low, urgent. “I need your help. I need everyone gathered at the library. Will, Ashley, Eddie. As soon as possible. Tonight.”
There was a pause.
“Tonight?” Claire echoed, clearly startled. “What’s going on?”
“I—it’s Walther, I think he’s—”
Bzzzt.
A loud burst of static drowned her out. The line went dead.
Madeleine blinked. Pulled the receiver away from her ear. “Claire?”
She wrenched it back, hit the switch to redial, heart slamming in her chest.
Nothing. Just a hollow whirring. Then more static.
She slammed her fist against the side of the booth in frustration, breath fogging the glass. Come on, come on—
She checked over her shoulder again.
That’s when she saw it.
A silhouette.
Tall. Motionless. Just past the edge of the gaslamp's glow. Unmoving, yet undeniably there, cloaked in darkness.
Madeleine’s heart dropped. Her breath hitched.
She spun back to the phone, redialled furiously. Her fingers shook. One more time. Just one more time—
The silhouette stepped closer.
Now within the haze of the lamp’s flickering light. Its outline was still indistinct, the shadows swallowing every feature—but it was walking toward her.
“Pick up—pick up—”
A soft click. Then: “Hello?”
“Claire!” Madeleine gasped. “I—I think someone’s—”
She turned slowly, hand tightening on the receiver cord.
The figure was now just under the gaslamp. The light illuminated its feet. Then its hands.
Gloved.
Still, no face.
Madeleine’s breath turned shallow, her instincts screaming.
Her hand dove into her satchel, fingers fumbling past parchment and bottles until they closed around the smooth wood of her wand.
She drew it in a single motion and pointed it straight toward the shadow.
But it was too late.
The booth’s light burst above her—pop—and the world plunged into darkness.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 15 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The golden glow of the Eden Flowers lined their way as Eddie, Markus, Torrie, and Catherine walked the Traveller’s Path. At first, the forest around them felt almost tranquil—tall trees and whispering leaves forming a serene backdrop. But as they ventured further, the air seemed to shift.
The trees grew thicker, their massive trunks now as wide as the houses back in Mariner’s Reach. The bark, gnarled and ancient, seemed to hum faintly, as if alive with the forest’s latent magic. Above, the canopy stretched so high that its uppermost branches disappeared into a swirling mist, shrouding the sky. Shafts of golden light occasionally pierced through, illuminating patches of vibrant moss and glowing mushrooms that clung to the enormous roots.
&quot;This… this doesn’t feel real,&quot; Markus muttered, craning his neck to take it all in. &quot;It’s like we’ve walked into another world.&quot;
Eddie said nothing, too caught up in the grandeur to respond. The sheer scale of the forest around them filled him with a mix of awe and smallness, as though they had stepped into the domain of ancient giants. Torrie clung to Eddie’s sleeve, her earlier fear of the dark now replaced by wide-eyed wonder.
Eventually, Catherine came to a halt, raising her hand to signal the others. She turned, her expression calm but filled with quiet reverence. &quot;We’ve arrived,&quot; she announced. Her voice carried a certain weight, as if to honor the place they now stood. &quot;This is the Heart of the Deep Glaive—the deepest, most ancient part of the Illusory Forest. We can rest here for now.&quot;
Eager to explore, Eddie and Markus exchanged a glance before wandering off the path, keeping close enough to stay within sight of the glowing flowers. They marveled at the unique vegetation that thrived on the massive tree trunks—vivid green mosses with faint silver veins, delicate flowers that shimmered with an iridescent glow, and clusters of mushrooms that emitted soft blue light.
&quot;This… this is incredible!&quot; Markus exclaimed, his voice tinged with childlike glee. &quot;Do you see this, Eddie? These are Everglow Mushrooms! And that moss… it’s Silverweave. These are rare—used for potent potions back at the apothecary!&quot;
Eddie leaned closer to inspect a flower with translucent petals. &quot;Goldenheart Bloom,&quot; he murmured, recognizing it from the apothecary books he’d studied. &quot;It’s said to enhance healing potions. This is worth a fortune.&quot;
Markus grinned. &quot;Catherine, can we pick these? Please tell me we can pick these.&quot;
Catherine, who had been watching from the path, gave a small laugh. &quot;The forest is generous,&quot; she said. &quot;Anything along the Traveller’s Path is free for you to take. Just don’t stray too far.&quot;
That was all the encouragement Markus needed. He and Eddie began carefully gathering the rare ingredients, their earlier fatigue forgotten in their excitement.
Meanwhile, Torrie sat cross-legged on the path, her attention captured by the Eden Flowers. She carefully plucked a few blooms, weaving them together into a delicate crown. The golden light of the flowers reflected in her wide grin as she placed the crown on her head.
&quot;How do I look?&quot; she asked, turning to show Catherine, Eddie, and Markus.
Catherine smiled warmly, her sharp Elven features softening. &quot;Radiant,&quot; she said, her voice kind.
Markus chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;Like a queen of the forest.&quot;
Eddie smirked, but his expression held a hint of affection. &quot;Don’t let it go to your head, Torrie.&quot;
The group seemed to relax for the first time since their journey began. The forest, once so mysterious and foreboding, now felt welcoming, almost protective. The glow of the Eden Flowers and the ancient grandeur of the Heart of the Deep Glaive filled them with a sense of peace and belonging.
For now, all seemed well.
After gathering, Eddie and Markus settled back to the Traveller’s Path, joining Torrie. 
Torrie, in her innocent gesture puts two of the Eden Flower crowns on top of Markus and Eddie, he could see to that Catherine also had one in her head, and Torrie didn’t seem to be stopping making the crowns.
The group settled into their tasks. Markus was enthusiastically cataloging their gathered ingredients, while Torrie was lost in her whimsical crown-making, the golden glow of the Eden Flowers framing her like a picture from a storybook. Eddie’s gaze lingered on Catherine as. She stood apart from the group, her hand clutching something—a map, Eddie realized—her expression drawn tight with frustration.
She should be pleased, Eddie thought. They’d reached the Heart of the Deep Glaive, a place so ancient and mysterious that just walking there felt like stepping into legend. But Catherine didn’t look triumphant. Her sharp Elven features were furrowed in concentration, and there was a glimmer of something else in her eyes. Disappointment.
It hit him like a blast of cold air. The conversation they’d had a few nights ago, outside the Swordfish Pub, rushed back to him.
She isn’t here for rare ingredients.
Catherine wasn’t like him, Markus, or Torrie. She wasn’t here to marvel at the grandeur of the forest or to collect rare herbs. She was here for something much bigger.
An artifact.
Eddie hesitated, watching her as she unfolded the map, the parchment old and weathered, its edges frayed and stained with dirt. The runes scrawled across it glowed faintly in the dim light, and she studied it with a mixture of disbelief and growing frustration.
Catherine then walked to the edge of the Traveller’s Path just next to Eddie. Her gaze was overlooking the abyss in front of her, the seeming darkness that enveloped the Illusory forest, as if searching something beyond its darkness.
Looking at her, Eddie stood up and looked to the direction Catherine is gazing.
She didn’t notice Eddie’s presence at first, her grip on the map tightening. When she finally noticed him, she sighed. &quot;We didn’t arrive where I thought we would,&quot; she admitted, her voice quiet but steady.
Eddie frowned, glancing at the map. &quot;What do you mean? This is the Heart of the Deep Glaive. Isn’t this… where you wanted to be?&quot;
Catherine shook her head, a frustrated sigh escaping her lips. She tapped a spot on the map, near a series of intricate symbols. &quot;The Traveler’s Path doesn’t lead directly to the ruins I was hoping to explore. I thought it might cross through, but… it doesn’t.&quot; She turned her gaze toward the shadowy expanse of the forest beyond the glowing Eden Flowers. &quot;The ruins are only a few meters off the path. Not far.&quot;
“I’m going over.”
Eddie stared at her, the weight of her words sinking in. Going over? She wanted to leave the safety of the Traveler’s Path—the only thing keeping them from being swallowed whole by the illusory magic of the forest—and venture into the unknown?
&quot;Are you crazy?&quot; The words escaped him before he could stop them.</Text>
            <Notes>What do they want? And why can’t they have it?

They already got what they want, that is they are already in the heart of the deep glaiveBut, Catherine is still not statisfied, turns out the paths did not cross where the Artefacts will be, so she wants to get it over the Traveller’s path

Why do we care? What if they don’t get itCatherine cannot leave without the Artefact, they are alredy this deep, and the party certaintly cannot ditch her

What are the good news?

Markus and Eddie found rare ingredients for the Apothecary, Torrie found her liking for Eden Flowers.What are the bad news?

Catherine is determined to seek the Artefact, that means, going over the paths</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 1 V2</Title>
            <Text>Things had always been a little off at 57th Howcliffe Road.
Edward Welton—Eddie, to most—couldn't remember exactly when the weirdness began. But if you asked him, he'd say it started sometime around his twelfth birthday, right around the time he began seeing things. Not ghosts, not shadows, but something far stranger. The world, to him, was made of dust—glimmering, writhing dust that shimmered in the light and shifted when no one else seemed to notice. Trees weren’t just trees; they were oceans of particles, drifting in slow, deliberate swirls. Stones breathed. Teacups had a heartbeat. The whole town, nestled near the white cliffs of Dover, felt like it was always quietly rearranging itself, grain by grain.
People said he was bright. Thoughtful. A little too quiet. Teachers caught him zoning out, eyes locked on nothing, or perhaps on something only he could see. When asked what was wrong, Eddie would blink, come back to earth, and say softly: &quot;I can see the dust moving.&quot;
By fifteen, they gave it a name. Schizophrenia, they called it. Medication followed. So did the quiet looks in the school corridors, the hushed voices from the kitchen when he passed by. But Eddie knew better. Deep down, he knew the world wasn’t broken—and neither was he.
It was just... different. And he was starting to suspect that maybe he was too.
It had been years since the diagnosis. Years since the pills dulled the edges of his vision and the swirling dust began to settle. 
Now, at eighteen, Eddie could almost convince himself that whatever he'd seen back then—whatever it was—had faded into nothing more than a strange memory.
Almost.
The truth was, the visions never truly left. They softened, quieted. These days, the dust moved slower, less urgently. Sometimes it didn’t move at all unless he stared long enough. And Eddie had learned, long ago, not to stare. Not in public, anyway.
He’d just finished sixth form. Barely. The end of school felt more like the ticking of a clock than the closing of a chapter—countdown to something he wasn’t quite ready for. University forms were filled, applications sent, rejections trickling in like drips from a leaky tap. It wasn’t that he wasn’t trying. He had tried. But with his patchy grades and his spotty explanations, what was there to go on?
Chemistry was the only subject that made sense to him—made too much sense, sometimes. Solutions spoke to him. Compounds whispered. He didn’t need to check the pH; he could feel it in the sting of the air. He didn’t measure, not really. He knew. Of course, that didn’t translate well to exams. Teachers praised his results but raised eyebrows at his working. “You skipped steps again, Mr.Welton,” they’d say. “You need to explain how you got there.” But how do you explain instincts honed by visions no one believed were real?
No scholarship board wanted a boy who couldn’t explain his brilliance, and no university wanted a file with more question marks than grades. So now he waited. Hung in limbo.
His father had already laid out a Plan B. An apprenticeship at a local mechanics’ firm—stable, honest work. The kind of job you could hold your head up for. “It’s good pay,” his dad had said over breakfast last week, toast in one hand, newspaper in the other. “You’re clever with your hands. It wouldn’t be so bad.”
It wouldn’t. But Eddie couldn’t shake the feeling—deep in his gut, down to his bones—that he belonged somewhere else. Somewhere bigger. Somewhere stranger. Somewhere he didn’t have to pretend that dust wasn’t dancing in the corners of his eyes.
He gave himself until the end of the summer. If no offer came, he’d take the apprenticeship.
Downstairs, the scent of browned toast and fried tomatoes drifted through the hallway like a morning bell.
Mrs. Welton stood at the stove, her hair pinned up in the usual messy knot, sleeves rolled to her elbows. She moved with practiced ease, buttering toast with one hand and flipping eggs with the other, the radio murmuring softly from the windowsill—some old soul track she only half-listened to.
“Torrie!” she called, loud enough to reach upstairs. “Come on, love, breakfast!”
A muffled clatter followed by the sound of feet scampering over floorboards answered her. The girl was always running late, always in a flurry of books, satchels, and half-brushed hair. Still, Mrs. Welton smiled to herself. It was nice, having at least one of them still excited about school.
She glanced toward the stairs, listening for Eddie. Nothing.
He’d been quieter lately. Not unusual, but still enough to tug at that part of a mother’s mind that never stopped worrying. She knew he was trying, poor thing—he’d always tried—but something about him lately felt heavier. Like he was waiting for a door to open that never quite did.
“Eddie!” she called, this time more gently. “Breakfast’s ready, sweetheart.”
No reply. Just the faint creak of floorboards above.
Torrie tumbled into the room, still pulling on her cardigan, glasses slightly askew. “Smells amazing!” she beamed, dropping her bag by her chair.
Mrs. Welton placed a plate in front of her. “Sit. Eat. And for heaven’s sake, brush that fringe before you leave.”
Torrie grinned, already reaching for the toast.
Mrs. Welton turned from the stove and smiled as she looked at her daughter, seated eagerly at the table.
“Look at you,” she said, voice warm with pride. “Beginning secondary school. You're growing up so fast.”
Torrie grinned, her mouth already half-full of toast. “I’m excited,” she said, swallowing quickly. “But also a bit nervous.”
“That’s perfectly normal, love,” Mrs. Welton replied, sitting down across from her with a steaming cup of tea in hand. “You remind me of your brother when he started secondary school. Quiet at first, like a little mouse—but give it a week, and he was darting off on his own, always in some sort of adventure.”
Torrie’s eyes lit up. “Really? What was Eddie like back then?”
Mrs. Welton chuckled softly, stirring her tea. “Curious. Almost too curious, if I’m honest. He was the kind of boy who wanted to know how everything worked—whether it was the toaster or the shed’s lock or the neighbor’s old lawnmower. I can’t count the number of times the school rang because he’d accidentally burned his hand or melted something he shouldn’t have touched.”
She paused, smiling to herself. “But he always meant well. Just had a mind that liked to wander places it wasn’t supposed to.”
Torrie giggled at the thought, eyes flicking toward the ceiling.
“Speaking of your brother…” Mrs. Welton said, glancing toward the staircase with a faint furrow of her brow. “Where is he? Didn’t he say he’d be the one to take you to your new school?”
Torrie shrugged. &quot;Haven’t seen him.&quot;
Mrs. Welton exhaled, rubbing her temple. &quot;Of course.&quot; She stood, pushing her chair back with a sigh.
Then she cupped her hands around her mouth and called up the stairs. &quot;Edward?!&quot;
Silence.
Mrs. Welton huffed. &quot;You stay here, hon. I’ll go see if he’s still in his room.&quot;
She turned and strode toward the staircase, muttering under her breath. Torrie just smiled, spooning up a mouthful of soup as she waited.

            <Title>Chapter 28 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Upon entering the courtyard, Eddie paused, captured by the enchanting scene before him. The space was a serene haven bursting with colourful flowerbeds of delicate daisies, fragrant lavender, and ethereal bluebells. Some flowers shimmered as if kissed by stardust. At the same time, an aromatic herb garden filled the air with the comforting scents of fresh basil and rosemary. 

His gaze was drawn to Catherine. She stood amidst the blooms, wearing a hospital gown that mirrored his own. Her broken alchemical staff, once a ruin after their encounter in the Deep Glaive, had been magically restored. The weld marks hint at her skill. She held it close to the flowers. Eddie watched in awe as the blooms seemed to respond to her presence. Flourishing as if she were watering them with magic. 

As Catherine gently fed the magical flowers with her energy. They began to bloom even brighter, a testament to her alchemical prowess and deep connection to nature. It was like she was sharing a part of herself with the garden. Fostering growth and vitality in this enchanting space. 

Eddie took a step closer, his heart swelling with admiration. Here was Catherine, a master of her craft, weaving her magic into the fabric of life around her. The courtyard felt alive with energy, and all his worries melted away for a moment. 

&quot;Catherine?&quot; he called softly, breaking the tranquillity. 

&quot;Edward,” She turned, a warm smile spreading across her face.  “Finally awake?&quot; 

He couldn't help but smile back, feeling the comfort of their friendship envelop him like a warm embrace. &quot;Yeah, thanks to some good company,&quot; he replied. Gesturing toward the vibrant flowers around her. 

Catherine chuckled, her eyes sparkling with mischief. 

&quot;Come, let's go for a walk,&quot; Catherine suggested. Her voice light as she began to stroll along one of the winding paths in the courtyard. 

Eddie fell in step beside her, taking in the vibrant surroundings. The bubbling water from the fountain filled the air, mingling with the soft rustle of leaves. He turned to Catherine, curiosity bubbling up inside him. &quot;What happened after I passed out? I mean, why did I even pass out in the first place?&quot; 

Catherine sighed, her expression shifting to something more serious. &quot;You fainted during our walk back. Markus gave you some painkilling sedatives to help with your injuries, but they can only last so long. We thought it best to bring you here for proper care.&quot; 

As they strolled through the courtyard, Eddie and Catherine fell into a rhythm of playful banter. Reminiscent of their earlier days. Though Eddie had matured, he couldn't help but engage in their familiar teasing. 

As they continued walking through the courtyard. Catherine's expression shifted. A glint of something thoughtful appeared in her eyes. She paused for a moment, looking out at the trees as if she were piecing together a memory. 
&quot;You know,&quot; Catherine said casually, leaning against the railing, &quot;I remember when I first arrived in Weshaven. You told me you were off to university—Edenfield, right? Big dreams and all that.&quot;
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Eddie muttered in frustation, hand running through his hair. &quot;I know I shouldn’t have lied. I never went to any university. I didn’t even try. That damn referral letter—” He let out a humorless chuckle. &quot;It doesn’t matter now. It expired weeks ago. Just another thing I let slip through my fingers.&quot;
Catherine tilted her head, studying him, but he wasn’t done.
&quot;Now, there’s nowhere else for me to go but back home,&quot; he continued, voice flat. &quot;So that's it. Back to Weshaven, back to the damn apothecary. Making potions and remedies for the rest of my life. Probably going gray behind the counter while Dad tells me how to grind herbs properly.&quot; 
Silence stretched between them.
Then, Eddie exhaled, his shoulders loosening just a little. &quot;But you know,&quot; he added, glancing at her, &quot;the past few weeks… running around with you, getting into all this mess—it’s been the most fun I’ve had in years. Even with the bruises, even with the near-death experiences… I haven’t felt that thrill, that excitement, since I was a kid doing my first transmutation. So Thank you.&quot;
Catherine’s expression softened, but there was a quiet intensity in her gaze. She stepped closer, her voice dropping lower, more serious.
Catherine stood there, her gaze softer than before. “Hmm, I suppose you’re right.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard. For a moment, he thought he’d misheard her. Catherine… agreeing with him? Not pushing, not nudging, not prodding him with yet another half-hearted motivational speech? His confusion deepened as she turned and began walking again.
“I’m sorry,” Catherine said, her voice gentle but steady. “I suppose these past few weeks I’ve been pushing you too hard. ‘Eddie, why not this, why not that,’” she added with a faint chuckle, shaking her head. “I’ve been so caught up in what I think is best for you that I didn’t stop to think how much it might’ve hurt you.”
Eddie stood rooted to the spot, watching her walk ahead. The words settled over him like a weight—heavy and suffocating. She had finally given up. After all her pushing, nagging, and coaxing, she was done.
And for the first time, the thought of Catherine stopping felt far worse than any of her nagging ever had.
This is it, Eddie thought, his chest tightening. This is how it happens. You stop arguing, you stop trying, and you go back to the apothecary, back to Weshaven, back to—
Back to a mundane life.
She turned and continued walking, her pace unhurried. Eddie trailed behind her, the weight in his chest growing heavier with every step.
“There’s nothing wrong with staying here in Weshaven, I suppose.” Catherine went on, her voice soft, almost wistful. “It’s quaint, beautiful, calm. And being an apothecary here, in the middle of all this… I think there is nothing wrong with it.”
No.
The word struck him like a thunderclap, reverberating through his entire being.
No, There is something wrong with that, in fact, it’s wrong to him.
His feet moved before his mind caught up. He stepped forward, his voice rising before he could second-guess himself.
“That’s what’s wrong for me, Catherine!” Eddie interrupted, his voice breaking as he stopped in his tracks.
She stopped and turned, surprised by the sudden outburst.
“It’s wrong for me to just stay here and pretend this is enough,” he said, his voice trembling. “It’s wrong for me to give up on Alchemy! Do you know what it feels like to love something so much it’s all you think about?”
His voice cracked, but he pushed through, the words spilling out as if he’d been holding them back for years.
“I’ve spent so much time lying to everyone—my parents, my friends, you—and pretending I don’t care, but I do. I care so much it hurts. I can’t keep pretending that this… this little life here in Weshaven is what I want. But It’s not. It’s never been enough.”
Catherine’s eyes softened, her lips parting as if to speak, but Eddie didn’t let her.
“And you know what’s worst of all?” His voice dropped to a near-whisper. “I’ve been lying to myself. Telling myself I can be happy here, that I can make this work. But I can’t. Because deep down, I know who I am, and I know what I want. I don’t want to be an apothecary. I don’t want to stay in this quiet, deadbeat hamlet, watching the years slip away.”
He looked at her, his expression filled with a mixture of desperation and resolve.
“It’s wrong for me to give up on my dreams, Catherine. It’s wrong for me to not go to Edenfield.”
The courtyard fell silent, save for the faint rustle of leaves in the breeze. Eddie stood there, his chest heaving as if he’d just run a great distance. For the first time in years, he felt the weight on his shoulders lift, replaced by a flicker of hope.
Eddie pressed forward, his steps heavy, his outburst echoing in his own ears. He didn’t look back at Catherine, too embarrassed by the rawness he’d just exposed.
“Sorry for the outburst,” he muttered, trying to sound nonchalant, though his voice wavered. “But I guess it’s all too late now, isn’t it?”
“It is not,” Catherine replied firmly, her voice carrying an undeniable conviction as she quickly caught up to him.
Eddie stopped, turning his head just enough to glance at her. He scoffed bitterly, shoving his hands into his pockets. “The recommendation letter for the Sage’s Institute Scholarship has expired, Catherine,” he said, his tone biting, though the bitterness was clearly aimed at himself. “What should I do? Walk in with an expired recommendation letter from seven years ago and beg for them to take me back?”
Catherine grinned slyly, the corners of her mouth quirking up as she tilted her head. “I don’t know,” she said, her tone playful. “I guess you could make that work.”
Eddie blinked, caught off guard by her lightheartedness. “What are you—”
Before he could finish, Catherine reached into the pocket of her medical gown, her movements deliberate yet casual. From it, she withdrew a gleaming brass card, holding it up between two fingers. The metallic surface caught the sunlight, casting a faint shimmer.
Eddie’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the object. He stepped closer, his curiosity overriding his frustration. The brass card bore Catherine’s name etched in elegant script, alongside an intricate alchemical symbol: a circle intertwined with a rectangle and a triangle.
“Tell them I sent you,” Catherine said, her voice steady, almost daring him to argue.
Eddie froze, staring at the card, the weight of her words sinking in. “Catherine… what is this?”
“It’s my recommendation,” she explained, her tone softening. “I may not be the head of the Sage’s Institute, but I’ve got enough credibility in Alchemy circles that they’ll have to think twice before dismissing you. An expired recommendation? That’s nothing. Not when they see this.”
His fingers twitched, and he reached out hesitantly, as if the brass card might vanish if he moved too quickly. When he finally took it, he felt the cool, smooth metal against his palm. It was heavier than he expected, carrying not just its physical weight but also the weight of her belief in him.
“You… you’d really do this for me?” Eddie asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Of course,” Catherine said, her expression softening into something more genuine. “I’ve seen what you can do, Eddie. I know how much Alchemy means to you. And if you want this, if you really want to go to Edenfield, then I’ll stand by you.”
Eddie’s throat tightened, and for a moment, he couldn’t find the words. He looked at the card again, then back at Catherine, who gave him an encouraging nod.
Eddie held the brass card tightly, a sense of determination reigniting within him. For the first time in years, the dream that felt so distant now seemed just within reach.

            <Title>Chapter 2</Title>
            <Text>The schoolyard was alive with noise—shouts from the football pitch, the rhythmic smack of a tennis ball against concrete, clusters of students laughing by the bike racks. Eddie kept his head down, hands stuffed in his pockets, his satchel bumping against his hip as he walked.
He passed a group of girls giggling over someone’s phone, their voices bright and tangled. A couple of guys from his chemistry class were shoving each other playfully, backpacks swinging. Near the bleachers, the drama club rehearsed lines with exaggerated gestures, their laughter carrying across the field.
Eddie didn’t stop. Didn’t look up.
His bike was where he’d left it that morning—leaning crookedly in the rack, its chain rusted, one handlebar grip fraying. He fished the key from his pocket, fingers brushing against the crumpled exam paper he’d shoved in there earlier. The symbols pressed against his thigh like a secret.
His bike was where he’d left it that morning—leaning crookedly in the rack, its chain rusted, one handlebar grip fraying. He fished the key from his pocket—
—or tried to.
His fingers brushed only lint and the crumpled exam paper. Frowning, Eddie patted his jacket pockets, one after another. Nothing. He yanked open his satchel, digging through crumpled notes and loose pens. Still nothing.
Did I leave it in class?
Then—a snicker.
Eddie froze. The sound came from behind the row of hedges near the bike racks. His head snapped up just in time to see a phone peeking out from the foliage, its camera lens glinting. As soon as he spotted it, the phone jerked back, followed by muffled laughter.
One by one, figures emerged from their hiding spots—six in total, led by a lanky boy with a smirk that made Eddie’s stomach drop. Liam Hargrove. Of course.
Liam dangled something from his fingers. A key. Eddie’s key.
&quot;Looking for this, Witch?&quot;  his voice dripping with mock concern.
The key dangled from Jason’s fingers, catching the afternoon sun in a cruel glint. Eddie’s chest tightened.
Jason.
His old best friend. The one who used to stay up late with him, whispering about conspiracy theories and laughing at stupid YouTube videos. The one Eddie had trusted with the truth about his episodes—the visions, the whispers, the way the world sometimes unfolded in ways it shouldn’t.
Now, Jason smirked, flanked by his new audience, and spun the key around his index finger.
&quot;Give me back my key, Jason,&quot; Eddie said, his voice low but firm.
Jason’s grin widened. He leaned in, close enough that Eddie could smell the mint gum he always chewed—the same brand he’d shared with Eddie during lunch breaks, back when they still sat together.
&quot;Or what?&quot; Jason said, loud enough for the others to hear. &quot;You gonna curse me, Witch? Make my pencil float?&quot;
Eddie’s jaw clenched. He told them. Jason had taken the things Eddie confessed in confidence and turned them into punchlines.
The key jingled as Jason tossed it carelessly into the air—once, twice—before snatching it back. &quot;You’re not even fun to mess with anymore,&quot; he said, sighing like Eddie was the one wasting his time. &quot;You just stand there. Like a weirdo.&quot;
Eddie didn’t move. Didn’t blink.
Then, with a slow, weary exhale, he shrugged—his arms lifting slightly before dropping back to his sides in defeat. &quot;Come on, Jason.&quot; His voice was quiet, but it carried. &quot;We were best mates before. Is this how you’ve become?&quot;
A ripple of laughter passed through Jason’s friends, their eyes flicking between the two of them. One of them elbowed Jason, grinning. &quot;Ooooh, he got you there, Jay.&quot;
Jason’s smirk wavered for half a second before he chuckled, shaking his head like Eddie was some pitiable joke. &quot;Yeah, I remember, Ed,&quot; he said, dragging out the nickname—the one only he used to call him. &quot;And I’m sure I was mistaken.&quot;
The way he said it made Eddie’s stomach twist.
Then Jason turned to his friends, his voice dropping into a dramatic, conspiratorial tone. &quot;See, Eddie here’s got this condition. If he doesn’t take his meds, he starts seeing things.&quot; He wiggled his fingers for effect. &quot;Once, on that Year 8 trip to the Natural History Museum, he lost his pills and spent the whole day staring at the minerals like they were speaking to him. Diagrams, symbols—proper freakout stuff.&quot;
Eddie’s breath hitched.
He remembered that day. The way the gemstones had pulsed with hidden geometries, how the tour guide’s voice had warped into a distant hum as the world sharpened into something more. He’d been terrified.
And Jason had been there, gripping his shoulder, whispering, &quot;It’s okay, Ed. Just breathe.&quot;
Now, Jason leaned in, his grin widening. &quot;Funny thing is…&quot; He tapped his temple. &quot;Turns out I was the one who nicked his meds before the trip. Just to see what’d happen.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Put ‘em back after, though. Wouldn’t want him to actually lose it, right?&quot;
His friends howled, slapping Jason’s back like he’d just told the funniest joke in the world.&quot;And don’t get me started when I got into this freak’s house!&quot; Jason crowed, his voice dripping with mockery. Eddie knew exactly where this was going—but he clenched his fists, forcing himself to stay still.
Jason launched into a dramatic retelling of Eddie’s parents’ shop—the jars of dried herbs lining the shelves, the strange symbols painted on the walls, the way the air always smelled like incense and something older. &quot;His mum’s got, like, actual bones in jars,&quot; Jason said, grinning as his friends gasped in exaggerated horror. &quot;And his dad? Pretty sure that guy doesn’t even speak English. Just grunts and writes shit down.&quot;
Eddie’s jaw tightened. His adoptive parents—Charles and Liana Zhang—had taken him in when he was six. They weren’t rich. They weren’t glamorous. But they’d given him a home. And Jason had sat at their dinner table more times than Eddie could count.
&quot;Jace,&quot; Eddie cut in, his voice low and dangerous. &quot;I’m telling you—if you go there, you’re out of the fucking line.&quot;
Jason blinked, then laughed, spreading his arms wide. &quot;What, am I lying? Everyone knows your ‘mum’ tells you that fairy-tale crap about your real parents being some powerful witches or some shit. That’s why they dumped you, Ed. Because even they knew you were—&quot;
Eddie didn’t let him finish.
Something inside him—something coiled tight for years—finally snapped.
He didn’t think.
He grabbed the nearest thing—a rusted bike chain dangling from the rack—and swung.
The impact sent a jolt up his arm. Jason crumpled with a choked gasp, hitting the pavement hard. The key bounced once on the concrete, landing just out of reach.
It was only then Eddie realized what was in his hand.
A metal pipe.
Not just any pipe—a thick, rusted length of steel, half-wrenched from the bike rack’s support. He shouldn’t have been able to pull it free. It was bolted down, solid.
But the ends gleamed oddly, the metal not quite solid—shimmering at the edges like liquid mercury.
&quot;You'll pay for this, you sick cunt!&quot;
The shout snapped Eddie back. Jason’s friends lunged at him—three of them, fists raised, faces twisted in rage.
Eddie didn’t think.
He swung again.
The pipe moved in his grip, as if it weighed nothing. It caught the first boy across the ribs with a hollow clang, sending him sprawling. The second dodged, but Eddie pivoted, the pipe’s end stretching—just slightly—like molten metal seeking contact. It clipped the third in the knee, and he went down screaming.
A fist grazed Eddie’s jaw. He stumbled, tasted blood.</Text>
