            <Title>Chapter 20 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The hallway was bathed in the golden light of late afternoon, the rhythmic sound of students’ footsteps and distant chatter filling the air. She adjusted her grip on the stack of classical books borrowed from the library—Balzac, Kawabata, a heavy anthology of Edo-period poetry—their weight familiar against her chest. The papers of student submissions for the Annual Magazine teetered precariously atop the books, threatening to slip with every step. 
&quot;Are you and Haruki having a fight?&quot; Her friend asked, adjusting her own bundle of poster supplies as they walked. &quot;You two seem far apart these past few days.&quot;
Honoka hesitated, her gaze dropping to the floor. &quot;N-no, it’s not like that Michiko.&quot; she murmured, though the uncertainty in her voice betrayed her. Then, softer: &quot;Well... Maybe.&quot;
Michiko sighed. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, shifting her load to one arm so she could nudge Honoka's shoulder, &quot;I think you two should talk about whatever's troubling you. You're deskmates, you know? It's not exactly a good sight to see both of you looking sour all day in class earlier.&quot;
A faint smile touched Honoka's lips. Michiko had always been too observant for her own good. 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she conceded, her voice barely above a whisper. &quot;It's my fault, really.&quot; The memory of their last conversation in the editing room rose unbidden—the way Haruki's eyes had widened when Honoka called her Fujiyama-san, the cold formality of it. She hugged the books tighter. &quot;But you're right. I... I kind of miss talking to her.&quot;
The words lingered in the air, heavier than she expected. She did miss Haruki—her sudden bursts of laughter, the way she’d doodle in the margins of her notes, the warmth of her presence beside her in class. But the memory of their last conversation—of Haruki’s meddling, of her own tearful plea—still stung.
They reached the intersection where the east wing branched toward the art rooms. Michiko hesitated, her gaze flickering between Honoka and the hallway ahead. &quot;I'm helping with the festival posters today,&quot; she said. &quot;Are you sure you don't need help with the editorial work?&quot;
Honoka shook her head, the motion sending her braid swaying. &quot;It's okay. I'm fine on my own.&quot; She forced a brighter tone, the way she always did when she didn't want to burden others. &quot;Good luck with the posters!&quot;
Michiko studied her for a moment longer before nodding. &quot;Don't work too hard, Honoka-chan. Good luck!&quot; she said, and with a wave, disappeared down the bustling hallway.
Alone again, Honoka exhaled, the tension in her shoulders easing just slightly. The Editorial Division room was her sanctuary—a small, quiet space tucked away near the library, usually reserved for her alone. As she walked, the rhythmic tap-tap of her loafers against the floor matched the cadence of her thoughts.
I should apologize. The realization settled over her like the golden afternoon light. She had overreacted, let her own insecurities color her words. Haruki had only been trying to help, in her own clumsy way. The thought of Haruki's usual exuberance—how she'd light up when discussing a new idea, how she'd doodle in the margins of her notes during lectures—made Honoka's chest ache.
She reached the familiar oak door, its frosted glass pane bearing the faded Editorial Division label in careful calligraphy. Balancing the books on one arm, she slid the door open—only to freeze on the threshold.
The Editorial Division room was a small, quiet space tucked away near the back of the school—a sanctuary of sorts, reserved mostly for her. As she slid the door open, the familiar scent of paper and ink greeted her. The room was empty, just as she’d hoped.
Setting her notebook down on the desk, she sank into the chair and exhaled slowly. The weight of the past few days pressed down on her—the confusion, the hurt, the guilt. She had been so quick to assume Haruki’s intentions, so quick to push her away. And now…
Her fingers absently flipped open her notebook, revealing pages of half-finished poems and scribbled edits. Words had always been her refuge, but even they felt hollow now.
Honoka turned to a section where she usually recorded facts and information from her readings, but her breath caught when she saw the margins filled with Haruki's doodles. Sketches of their teachers with exaggerated features made her lips twitch - there was Mr. Tanaka with his caterpillar eyebrows stretching off the page, and stern Principal Kobayashi depicted as a grumpy badger. Between notes on classical poetry were futuristic designs she didn't recognize - sleek vehicles that looked like they belonged in a sci-fi novel, and a strange, round-eared cartoon character holding what appeared to be some sort of advanced gaming device (all things Haruki had absentmindedly drawn from her 21st century memories).
She's really a great artist Honoka thought, tracing a particularly detailed sketch of the school courtyard. A quiet giggle escaped her as she discovered a caricature of their physics teacher mid-sneeze, his glasses flying off his face.
The warmth of the memory faded as she returned to her work, her pencil hovering over an analysis of Bashō's haiku. The creaking floorboard behind her barely registered as she muttered, &quot;Why did he choose 'ancient pond' instead of 'old pond'? The syllable count is the same, but the feeling...&quot; Her pencil tapped rhythmically against the page, leaving tiny graphite dots like breadcrumbs of her concentration.
Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, the door behind her creaked open, slightly breaking her concentration. The sound of footsteps and the faint jingle of a charm bracelet broke the silence.
&quot;Honoka-chan!&quot;  a sing-songy voice called out, bright and cheerful. “There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”
The voice barely pierced her focus. Her finger continued tracing the kanji on the page as she whispered, &quot;Maybe if I substitute 'stillness' here...&quot;
The girl, standing by the door with her hands on her hips, frowned when Honoka didn’t respond.
&quot;Honoka-chan!&quot; Louder this time, tinged with frustration.
The pencil kept moving, now scribbling possible alternatives in the margin.
“Aw come on!” The girl groaned, “Are you still angry at me?”
When no response came, The girl's mischievous grin returned. She slipped off her shoes and began tiptoeing across the wooden floor with exaggerated care, each step calculated to avoid the known squeaky boards she'd memorized from previous visits. Her shadow loomed over Honoka's hunched form as she raised her hands like a cartoon villain.
Quietly, the girl tiptoed across the room, her sneakers making no sound on the wooden floor. She crept up behind Honoka, her hands poised to strike.
Then, with a dramatic flourish, she clapped her hands on Honoka’s shoulders and shouted,
&quot;BOO!&quot;
The effect was instantaneous. Honoka jolted as if electrocuted, her chair legs screeching against the floor before tipping backward in slow motion. Her arms windmilled wildly, sending papers soaring like startled birds. An open textbook sailed past Haruki's head while Honoka's prized fountain pen clattered against the far wall.
Books, parchments, loose papers exploded into the air, cascading down like confetti in a parade of overwork. Her body caught on an open book—and she tumbled off her chair entirely, landing flat on her back with a heavy thud.
&quot;H-haruki?!&quot; Honoka sputtered, her glasses askew and hair now decorated with loose notes. “What was that for?!”
Haruki burst into laughter, doubling over as Honoka scowled. “You should’ve seen your face!” she wheezed, clutching her stomach. 
Honoka's cheeks puffed up in indignation, her brows knitting together as she adjusted her glasses with exaggerated precision. 
&quot;This girl is impossible to deal with,&quot; she grumbled under her breath, crossing her arms tightly. But as she watched Haruki - her shoulders shaking with mirth, tears of laughter glistening at the corners of her eyes, that familiar unruly lock of hair bouncing with each guffaw - something in Honoka's stern expression began to waver.
A tiny snort escaped Honoka's nose despite herself. She immediately clapped a hand over her mouth, but it was too late. Haruki's laughter redoubled at the sound, and soon Honoka found her own shoulders shaking. The giggles bubbled up uncontrollably, her proper posture crumbling as she collapsed forward, her forehead nearly touching her knees.
&quot;You - you looked like a startled cat!&quot; Haruki managed between gasps, miming puffed-up fur with her hands.
&quot;Oh shut up!&quot; Honoka shot back, but there was no heat in it - just breathless amusement as she wiped at her own tears. The papers still scattered around them bore witness to their chaos, some drifting lazily in the air currents from the open window.
Their laughter gradually subsided into comfortable silence, punctuated only by occasional residual giggles. Haruki flopped down onto the floor beside Honoka, their shoulders brushing as they both caught their breath. The late afternoon sun streamed through the window, painting everything in golden hues and stretching their shadows across the paper-strewn floor.
For the first time in days, the air between them felt light again.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 14 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki walked along the paved road back to her cabin, the cool night air brushing against her skin. The stars above were bright, their light filtering through the trees that lined the path. But unlike the lie she had told her friends, there was no grandfather waiting for her at home. No family, no warmth—just the empty cabin, silent and still.
As she walked, her mind drifted back to the night she had first arrived in this time. She remembered the fight with her father, the way she had shouted at him for asking her to quit the arts club. She had been so angry, so sure that he didn’t understand her. But now, after spending time with the younger version of him, she realized how wrong she had been. She hadn’t known back then—hadn’t known how much he had sacrificed for her, for their family. The weight of that realization pressed heavily on her chest, and her pace quickened.
Her father had given up his dreams—his music, his freedom—to take on the responsibilities that had been thrust upon him. He had become stern, distant, because he had to. Because he had no other choice. And now, as Haruki thought about her own dreams, her own rebellion, she saw the parallels between them. She was artistic, passionate, and stubborn—just like him. The only difference was that she still had the chance to chase her dreams, while he had buried his long ago.
The guilt she felt was overwhelming, a sharp ache that spread through her chest and made it hard to breathe. She had been so quick to judge him, to resent him for not being the father she wanted. But now, she understood. And that understanding only made the guilt worse.
Her walk turned into a jog, her feet pounding against the pavement as she pushed herself forward. The night air rushed past her, cool and sharp, but it did nothing to ease the heat building inside her. Her thoughts were a whirlwind, a storm of emotions she couldn’t quite untangle. She needed to get back to the cabin, to the place where this journey had begun. Maybe there, in the quiet solitude of that old house, she could make sense of everything.
By the time she reached the cabin, she was sprinting, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. The house loomed ahead, its two sets of front doors standing like silent sentinels in the night. Haruki skidded to a stop, her chest heaving as she stared up at the familiar structure. It looked the same as it had the night she arrived—old, weathered, and filled with secrets.
Haruki walked around to the back door, her mind racing. She had to go back. Her parents must be worried sick about her. She had to go back. The thought consumed her, driving her forward with a desperate urgency.
The back door—the one she had tried to pry open the night before from the inside, to no avail—stood before her now, its wooden surface rough and unyielding under her hands. She grabbed the handle and pulled, her muscles straining as she tried to force it open. When that didn’t work, she kicked it, the impact sending a sharp jolt of pain up her leg. Still, the door didn’t budge.
“Come on,” she muttered under her breath, her voice trembling. She slammed her body against the door, once, twice, the sound echoing in the quiet night. But it was no use. The door remained firmly shut, as if mocking her efforts.
Frustration boiled over into desperation. Haruki grabbed a heavy rock from the ground and hurled it at the door, aiming for the lock. The sound of the impact was loud, but the door didn’t so much as creak. She tried again, this time with a log, her arms shaking with the effort. Still, nothing.
“Let me go back!” she shouted, her voice breaking as tears streamed down her cheeks. She pounded on the door with her fists, the sound sharp and frantic. “I’m sorry, alright!” she cried, her voice raw with emotion. “I’m sorry I was so selfish! I’m sorry I ran away! I’m sorry…”
Her legs gave out, and she slumped against the door, her forehead pressing against the rough wood. Her breaths came in ragged gasps, her body trembling with exhaustion and grief. “I miss Mom…” she whispered, her voice weak and trembling. “I miss Dad… I miss Aiko and Aikihito…” Her voice grew even softer, barely audible. “I want to go back…”
The night was silent except for the sound of her quiet sobs. The stars above seemed distant and cold, their light offering no comfort. Haruki sat there, her back against the door, her arms wrapped around her knees. She felt small and alone, the weight of her guilt and longing pressing down on her like a physical force.
Then, a voice broke the silence.
“You’re going nowhere by prying it open, you know?” The voice was soft but clear, coming from somewhere behind her. Haruki turned her head sharply, her heart skipping a beat.
At first, she didn’t see anyone. The backyard was bathed in shadows, the moonlight casting long, eerie shapes across the ground. But then her eyes landed on a figure sitting near a tree, partially hidden by the darkness. An easel stood in front of the figure, and the faint sound of a brush against canvas reached Haruki’s ears.
“Rocks, logs, run a car into it if you want to. It won’t open,” the girl said, her tone matter-of-fact, as if she were commenting on the weather.
Haruki stood up slowly, her legs still shaky from crying. She took a step forward, then another, her eyes fixed on the girl. As she got closer, the details became clearer—the round glasses perched on the girl’s nose, the braid trailing down her back, the way she held the brush with practiced ease. A sense of déjà vu washed over Haruki, a nagging feeling that she had seen this girl before. But where? And when?
The girl dipped her brush into a jar of paint thinner, cleaning it with slow, deliberate movements. She didn’t look up, her focus entirely on the canvas in front of her. Haruki could see the painting now—a detailed depiction of the cottage from behind, the backyard garden rendered in soft, muted colors. It was beautiful, but there was something haunting about it, something that made Haruki’s chest tighten.
“You know…” the girl said, her voice calm and measured, “I would never have expected to see anyone here from the future.” She finally looked up, her eyes meeting Haruki’s. “Especially you, Haruki-chan.”
Haruki’s breath caught in her throat. The girl’s face—those round glasses, that braid, the faint smile playing on her lips—it all clicked into place. Memories flooded her mind: a classroom, an upperclassman who always seemed to be sketching in the corner, a quiet presence that Haruki had admired but never really known.
“M-Matsuda-senpai?” Haruki stammered, her voice barely above a whisper.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 1 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, somewhere across the school yard, practicing.
The distant screeching of shoes, the rhytmic thudding of basketball being bounced at the gymnasium below.
The rhythmic scratching of a paintbrush against canvas filled the small room, each stroke deliberate, each movement lost in the rhythm of creation. 
The room smelled of acrylics and turpentine, a scent that Haruki had come to associate with freedom—a freedom she rarely felt outside these four walls.
In the center of the room stood a girl, her figure silhouetted by the golden light of the setting sun streaming through the window. Haruki Fujiyama, her dark hair tied loosely in a ponytail, stood before an easel, her paintbrush moving almost instinctively across the canvas. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, her lips pressed into a thin line as she lost herself in the world she was creating. 
To anyone watching, it might have seemed like she was painting a landscape or a portrait, but to Haruki, it was something more. It was a world—a world where the colors bled into each other like emotions, where the lines blurred between reality and imagination. A world where she could be anything.
She stepped back for a moment, tilting her head as she studied her work. The painting was abstract, a swirl of blues and purples with streaks of gold cutting through like sunlight breaking through a storm. It wasn’t perfect—nothing ever was—but it was hers. 
For a fleeting moment, she wondered if such a place could exist. A place where she didn’t have to argue with her father about art school, where her mother didn’t gently suggest she consider a “more practical” career. A place where she could just be, without the weight of expectations pressing down on her shoulders.
Her brush hovered over the canvas as her thoughts drifted. What would it be like to live in a world where her dreams weren’t just dreams? Where she could paint all day, every day, and no one would tell her it was a waste of time? Where her father’s stern face would soften with pride instead of disappointment? She sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. Maybe such a world only existed in her paintings. Maybe it was foolish to hope for anything more.
Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, the door behind her creaked open, pulling her back to reality. The sound of footsteps and the faint jingle of a charm bracelet broke the silence.
Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, the door behind her creaked open, pulling her back to reality. The sound of footsteps and the faint jingle of a charm bracelet broke the silence.
“Haruki-chan!” a sing-songy voice called out, bright and cheerful. “There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”
Haruki didn’t hear her at first. Her mind was still lost in the world of her painting, far removed from the Art Club room. She was thinking about the shadows—how they should fall, how they should interact with the light. Should the reds be warmer? Did the greens clash? She murmured to herself, her brush hovering uncertainly over the canvas. “Maybe if I add a touch of ochre here…”
The girl, standing by the door with her hands on her hips, frowned when Haruki didn’t respond.
“Haruki-chan!” she called again, louder this time. Still, Haruki didn’t turn.
The boy, standing beside Aiko with arms crossed, let out a quiet sigh. “Aiko, don’t,” he warned, already sensing what she was about to do.
Aiko flashed him a grin, ignoring his disapproving tone. “Oh, come on, Akihito. She’s too in her head again.”
Akihito adjusted his glasses, exasperation flickering across his face. “So? Let her concentrate.”
“Or,” Aiko said mischievously, “I could bring her back to reality in the fun way.”
Quietly, Aiko tiptoed across the room, her sneakers making no sound on the wooden floor. She crept up behind Haruki, her hands poised to strike.
Then, with a dramatic flourish, she clapped her hands on Haruki’s shoulders and shouted, “Boo!”
Haruki jumped, her paintbrush slipping from her fingers and smearing a streak of green across the canvas.
“Aiko!” she exclaimed, spinning around to glare at her friend. “What was that for?!”
Aiko burst into laughter, doubling over as Haruki scowled. “You should’ve seen your face!” she wheezed, clutching her stomach. “Priceless!”
Akihito let out another sigh and shook his head. “You’re impossible,” he muttered, walking over to inspect the damage. “And now she has to fix that.”
Haruki groaned, turning back to her painting. “Ugh, Aiko! This was almost done!”
“Relax, relax! You can totally turn that into, uh…” Aiko squinted at the streak. “A tree branch? A shadow? A really abstract emotion?”
Akihito pinched the bridge of his nose. “Or you could just not ruin her work in the first place, Aiko.”
Haruki sighed, rubbing her temple. “You two are exhausting.”
“See?” Aiko grinned, nudging Akihito. “She means you too.”
Akihito simply crossed his arms. “At least I’m not the one causing her problems.”
Haruki shook her head, but despite herself, a small smile tugged at her lips. The three of them were an odd balance—Aiko’s chaos, Akihito’s restraint, and her own quiet focus—but somehow, it worked.
“Yeah, yeah,” Aiko said, still giggling. She stepped closer, peering over Haruki’s shoulder at the painting. “Whatcha painting there, Picasso?”
Haruki didn’t look up, her focus returning to the canvas. “Komorebi,” she said simply. “I need practice painting light.”
Aiko tilted her head, studying the painting. It was a tree, its leaves dappled with sunlight that seemed to shimmer even in its unfinished state. “Whoa, that’s awesome!” she said, her voice dripping with mock enthusiasm. “Is the light going to be brighter than your future?”
“Don’t be silly. It’s just a painting.” Haruki chuckled despite herself, shaking her head. “Why the weird question?”
Before Aiko could answer, Akihito cleared his throat from where he stood, arms crossed. “Speaking of your future,” he said, his tone even but pointed, “you still haven’t filled out your Career Plans paper.”
“Mrs. Kitagawa has been asking about it all day. You’re one of the last people who haven’t submitted it.” He reached into his neatly organized bag and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. “You left this at your desk this morning.”
Haruki’s smile faltered as she looked at the paper. “Oh, yeah,” she said quietly, setting down her painting knife. She peeled off her paint-stained gloves and apron, then took the paper from Aiko. The words “Career Plans” were printed in bold letters at the top, and the sight of them made her stomach twist.
“So, have you thought of any?” Aiko asked, leaning casually against the table. Her tone was light, but her eyes were curious, searching Haruki’s face for an answer.
Haruki sighed, setting the Career Plans paper down on the table. “No… I’m not sure.”
Akihito, who had been re-organising his bag, glanced up. “What about Tokyo University?” he suggested. “You’re one of our best painters in the Art Club. Their fine arts program is one of the best. My older brother goes there to study computer science, he says the professors are amazing, and their alumni do well in the industry.”
Haruki hesitated, her fingers tightening around her paintbrush. 
Aiko perked up at the idea. “Ohhh, that’s a great idea! You’d totally get in,” she said, nudging Haruki with her elbow.
But instead of excitement, Haruki’s shoulders slumped. She turned back to her painting, brushing light strokes onto the canvas as if to distract herself. “You know my dad,” she murmured. “He’d rather I become a doctor or something ‘respectable’ than go there.”
Akihito frowned slightly but didn’t push. Aiko, on the other hand, scoffed. “Pfft, respectable? As if painting isn’t just as important!”
Akihito gave her a pointed look. “That’s not how the world works, Aiko.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Aiko waved him off before turning back to Haruki. “But seriously, Haru-chan, don’t let your dad kill your dreams.”
Haruki swallowed, eyes lingering on the painting in front of her. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Maybe it’s not a dream if I can’t even say it out loud.”
Aiko frowned, crossing her arms. “Why not? Didn’t one of the seniors from Art Club go there?” She tapped her chin, trying to remember. “I think she used to be the vice president of the Art Club back when we were first-years.”
Haruki paused, her brush hovering over the canvas. “Matsuda-senpai?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Yeah! Yaeko Matsuda!” Aiko said, snapping her fingers. “Her paintings were gorgeous. Didn’t she go to Tokyo University to pursue fine arts?”
“Aiko… Didn’t you know?” Akihito said, “She never enrolled.”
“Wait,” Haruki swiftly turned to him, for a second, she abandoned her painting to fully turn towards them. “What do you mean?”
“Although my brother didn’t study fine arts there, he is studying computer science,” Akihito explained. “I asked him about Matsuda-senpai once, just out of curiosity. But when he checked, she wasn’t on any student lists. None of the professors had heard of her, and even the students she was supposed to be friends with had no idea where she went.”
Haruki fell silent, her expression darkening. The room seemed to grow colder, the cheerful chatter of the brass band outside, the rhytmic thudding, screeching and cheer from the gymnasium below fading into the background. She set her brush down and turned fully to face him.
Aiko blinked, confused. “Wait… so what are you saying?”
Akihito exhaled, folding his arms. “I don’t know. Just that she disappeared before graduation, and nobody—not her classmates, not even her close friends—knows where she went.”
Aiko’s playful demeanor flickered, replaced by unease. “Are you implying that she—?”
Haruki didn’t answer right away. Her fingers tightened around the brush in her hand. Disappeared? That couldn’t be right.
Her gaze drifted past Akihito and Aiko, toward the wall of polaroid photos behind them. The Art Club’s memories, snapshots of their weekly plein-air painting sessions, their shared laughter, the occasional paint-smudged chaos. Her eyes scanned over familiar faces, frozen mid-laughter, mid-brushstroke, before landing on one particular photo.
Yaeko Matsuda.
Her hair was tied in a neat braid, round glasses perched on her nose, a gentle yet confident smile on her face. Below the picture, scrawled in thick marker, were the words: Fight on, Vice President Matsuda!
Haruki’s throat tightened. Back when she was a first-year, she had looked up to Matsuda more than anyone. It was Matsuda who had trusted her, who had passed on the role of Vice President before her graduation. Haruki had always believed that Matsuda was out there, pursuing her dreams, painting, creating—just as she had always encouraged Haruki to do.
But what if she never made it?
 “No…” Haruki swallowed, her fingers loosening from the brush. “That can’t be right.”
She tore her gaze away from the photo, but the weight in her chest remained. The room felt colder, the usual warmth of the Art Club replaced with something hollow and uncertain.
For a moment, none of them spoke. The distant sound of the brass band outside felt oddly out of place, as if the world beyond their quiet art room had no idea that a mystery had just settled in the space between them.
Then, Akihito exhaled and ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry,” he said, offering a sheepish smile. “I didn’t mean to make the room feel like a horror story.” He leaned back against the table, glancing between them. “It’s probably just a rumor, anyway. A big university like Tokyo? My brother might’ve just had bad luck trying to find her.”
Haruki let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. The tension eased, if only slightly. “Yeah… maybe,” she murmured.
Aiko, sensing the shift, clapped her hands together. “Alright! Enough ghost stories before sunset.” She stretched, her usual energy returning, though there was still a flicker of unease in her eyes.
Haruki forced a small smile. “I’ll tidy up for a bit, then I’ll meet you at the bicycle park.”
“Got it!” Aiko chirped, her usual sing-songy voice back in full force. But as she turned to leave, she paused at the doorframe, glancing back at Haruki. “Hey, Haruki-chan.”
Haruki raised an eyebrow. “Hmm?”
Aiko grinned. “Have you thought of any career path, just off the top of your head?”
Haruki tilted her head. “Off the top of my head—?”
“Quick! Answer, no time!” Aiko teased, rocking on her heels.
Haruki hesitated for a moment, then smiled. “Art school,” she said firmly. “That’s what’s on the top of my head.”
Aiko’s smile widened, and she gave Haruki a thumbs-up. “Then write it on your paper and submit it before Mrs. Kitagawa continues nagging me about it!”
Haruki laughed, the last remnants of tension finally lifting. “I will, I will. Now go on, I’ll catch up.”
As Aiko disappeared down the hallway, her footsteps echoing faintly, Haruki turned back to her painting. The komorebi—the sunlight filtering through the leaves—seemed to glow brighter now, as if reflecting the spark of determination in her heart. She dipped her brush into the thinner, cleaning it carefully before putting everything in its place. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 17 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki walked out of the school building, her shoulders slumped and her steps slow. The sky above was painted in streaks of orange and magenta, the sun dipping low on the horizon and casting a warm, golden glow over the campus. Around her, students chattered excitedly, their laughter and voices filling the air as they finished their club activities and headed home. The atmosphere was lively, almost electric, but Haruki felt none of its energy.
To her, the world seemed muted, as if she were walking through a fog. The vibrant colors of the sunset blurred together, and the cheerful voices of her classmates sounded distant, like echoes from another life. She dragged her feet along the path, her schoolbag hanging heavily from her shoulder, its weight mirroring the burden in her chest.
The school gates loomed ahead, their iron frames casting long shadows across the ground. Haruki paused for a moment, staring at them as if they were a barrier she couldn’t bring herself to cross. Beyond the gates, the road stretched out, leading to the cabin that had become her temporary home. But tonight, it felt less like a refuge and more like a reminder of how far she was from everything she knew.
Just as she was about to step through the gates, a voice called out from behind her. “Hey, Haruki-chan!”
Haruki turned, her heart sinking as she saw Nagano jogging toward her, his guitar slung over his shoulder and a carefree grin on his face. She hadn’t realized how close they had become over the past few weeks, but now his presence felt like a weight she couldn’t bear.
“What’s up?” Nagano asked, falling into step beside her as if nothing were wrong. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Haruki didn’t respond, her gaze fixed on the ground. She didn’t have the energy to pretend everything was fine.
Nagano, undeterred, continued talking. “Anyway, me and the guys are planning something for next Saturday. We’re thinking of heading to the beach again. You should come! It’ll be fun.”
Haruki shook her head, her voice lifeless. “No, thank you.”
Nagano blinked, his grin faltering. “Whoa, what’s with the attitude? You’re usually all over these kinds of things.”
Haruki didn’t answer, her steps slowing as she tried to put distance between them. But Nagano wasn’t one to let things go so easily. He matched her pace, his tone shifting to one of concern. “Hey, seriously, what’s wrong? You’ve been acting weird all day.”
“Leave me alone,” Haruki mumbled, her voice barely audible.
Nagano chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. “Come on, Haruki-chan. You can’t just say that and expect me to drop it. What’s going on? Did someone say something to you?”
Haruki stopped walking, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. She could feel the anger bubbling up inside her, a storm she could no longer contain. “I said, leave me alone!” she snapped, her voice sharp and trembling.
Nagano raised his hands in mock surrender, but his smile didn’t fade. “Alright, alright. No need to bite my head off. I’m just trying to help.”
“Help?” Haruki echoed, her voice rising. “You’re not helping! You’re just… you’re just an inconsiderate, selfish person! You don’t care about anyone but yourself!”
Nagano’s smile vanished, replaced by a look of genuine confusion. “What are you talking about? What did I do?”
“You hurt Honoka’s feelings!” Haruki shouted, her voice cracking. “She’s been trying to talk to you for weeks, for months! Why didn’t you even try to notice her? Why didn’t you care?”
Nagano stared at her, his brow furrowed. “Honoka? Aoki Honoka? What are you talking about? I didn’t even know she felt that way.”
Haruki’s chest tightened, her anger giving way to a crushing sense of despair. “You… you didn’t even like her?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Nagano shrugged, his expression apologetic but honest. “No. I mean, she’s nice and all, but… I didn’t even know she liked me. I don’t feel that way about her.”
Haruki felt as if the ground had been ripped out from under her. All her efforts, all her plans—they were for nothing. Her parents weren’t going to get together. She wasn’t going to exist. The weight of that realization was too much to bear.
In a burst of anger and frustration, Haruki shoved Nagano with all her strength. He stumbled backward, his guitar slipping from his shoulder as he fell to the ground. “H-hey, what the—” he stammered, his voice a mix of surprise and indignation.
“Idiot!” Haruki bellowed, her voice raw with emotion. Before Nagano could say anything else, she turned and ran, her feet pounding against the pavement as tears streamed down her face.
The world blurred around her as she ran, the orange and magenta streaks of the sunset smearing into a haze of color. Her chest burned with each breath, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop. Not when the weight of her failure pressed down on her like a physical force.
She ran past the wooden shelter where she had once sat with Nagano, where she had listened to him talk about his dreams and his fears. The memory flashed in her mind—his voice, soft and resigned, as he spoke about abandoning his music for the sake of his family. She had felt such empathy for him then, such understanding. But now, all she felt was anger—at him, at herself, at the unfairness of it all.
Her feet carried her down the familiar road she and Honoka usually took home from school. The road where they had walked side by side, chatting about everything and nothing. Haruki hadn’t realized how much she had come to rely on those moments, on Honoka’s quiet presence and gentle smile. It had been almost a month now, and she had grown used to Honoka’s company, to the way she made even the most mundane days feel a little brighter.
But now, that was gone. Honoka’s tearful plea echoed in her mind: “Just stop it…” Haruki’s chest tightened, and she ran faster, as if she could outrun the guilt and regret that chased her. What did Honoka think of her now? Did she hate her? Did she think Haruki had been playing some cruel joke on her all along? The thought made Haruki’s stomach churn.
She ran and ran, her legs aching and her breath coming in ragged gasps, until finally, she reached the cabin. Matsuda wasn’t home yet, and the silence that greeted her felt oppressive, suffocating. Haruki slammed the door shut behind her and slumped against the wall, sliding down until she was sitting on the floor. She pulled her knees to her chest, shielding her face as she hugged them tightly.
The tears came then, hot and uncontrollable, streaming down her cheeks as she buried her face in her knees. Her shoulders shook with silent sobs, the weight of her failure crashing down on her all at once.
“What have I done…” she thought, her mind spiraling. She had been so sure she could fix things, so determined to bring her parents together. But instead, she had only made everything worse. She had hurt Honoka, lashed out at Nagano, and now… now she had doomed not only herself but her parents’ future.
The realization hit her like a punch to the gut. If Nagano didn’t love Honoka, if they didn’t get together… then Haruki would never exist. Her entire life, her memories, her family—all of it would be erased, as if it had never been. And it was all her fault.
She thought of her parents in the present—her stern, distant father and her kind but weary mother. She thought of the fights, the misunderstandings, the moments of quiet love that had kept their family together despite everything. And she thought of the younger versions of them she had come to know in this time—Nagano, with his dreams of music, and Honoka, with her quiet strength. They were so different from the people she knew, and yet, in some ways, they were exactly the same.
But now, because of her, they would never become the people she knew. They would never become her parents.
Haruki’s sobs grew louder, her body trembling as she hugged her knees tighter. She felt so small, so helpless. She had tried so hard, and yet it hadn’t been enough. It would never be enough.
The cabin was silent except for the sound of her crying, the walls closing in around her. She didn’t know how long she sat there, lost in her thoughts and regrets. But eventually, the tears slowed, and her breathing evened out. She wiped her face with her sleeve, her eyes red and swollen.
She didn’t know what to do next. She didn’t know if there was anything she could do. But as she sat there, staring at the floor, a flicker of determination sparked within her. She couldn’t give up. Not yet. Not when so much was at stake.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 2.5 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki continued on her way, the rhythmic sound of her bicycle wheels against the pavement filling the silence. Soon, she turned onto a tree-lined street, where the houses grew larger and more imposing. Her own home stood at the end of the road, a traditional Japanese estate that exuded both elegance and isolation. The wooden gate creaked softly as she pushed it open, and she wheeled her bicycle into the garage, the dim light casting long shadows across the empty space.
The house itself was grand, with a sloping tiled roof and a meticulously maintained garden that seemed almost too perfect, as if it had been frozen in time. The sliding doors were made of polished wood, and the paper screens glowed faintly with the warm light from inside. Despite its beauty, the house often felt cold and empty, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath.
Haruki slipped off her shoes at the entrance, placing them neatly on the shoe rack. She glanced at the other pairs—her father’s polished leather shoes were absent, as usual, but her mother’s modest flats were there. She was home early today.
“I’m back,” Haruki called out, her voice echoing through the spacious hallway. The house seemed to swallow her words, leaving only silence in their wake.
Haruki stepped into the house, the polished wooden floors cool beneath her socks. She closed the door softly behind her, careful not to make too much noise. The last thing she wanted was to draw her mother’s attention. She was tired, her shoulders heavy from the day, and all she wanted was to retreat to her room and lose herself in her sketchbook.
She tiptoed through the hallway, her footsteps barely audible. To her left was the open doorframe leading to the kitchen and dining area. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her mother sitting at the dining table, still in her tailored suit from work. Her laptop was open in front of her, its screen casting a faint glow on her face. Stacks of papers—student assignments waiting to be graded—were piled neatly beside her. Her mother’s glasses perched low on her nose as she scribbled notes in the margins of a worksheet.
Good, Haruki thought, relief washing over her. She’s busy. Now’s my chance to slip through.
She quickened her pace, her hand already reaching for the banister of the stairs. But just as her foot touched the first step, her mother’s voice cut through the silence.
“Haruki?” Her tone was stern and steady, the kind of voice that brooked no argument. “Come talk with me at the dining table.”
Haruki froze, her heart sinking. She closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath to steady herself. “Yes, Mom,” she said, forcing her voice to sound neutral.
She turned and walked into the dining area, her shoulders tense. Her mother didn’t look up immediately, her pen still moving across the paper. Haruki stood awkwardly by the table, her hands clasped behind her back, waiting.
Finally, her mother set down her pen and removed her glasses, setting them carefully on the table, her nametag written “Honoka Fujiyama” is still etched on her tailored suit. She looked up at Haruki, her expression unreadable. “How was school?” she asked, her voice calm but probing.
“It was fine,” Haruki replied, her tone clipped. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, avoiding her mother’s gaze.
There was a brief silence between the two, broken only by the occasional click-clacking of her mother’s laptop keys. The sound was sharp and deliberate, each keystroke echoing in the quiet room. Haruki stood awkwardly, her hands fidgeting behind her back, wishing she could just disappear upstairs.
Then her mother took a quick glance away from her laptop, her eyes narrowing as she noticed something on Haruki’s uniform and face. “What is that on your uniform and face?” she asked, her voice tinged with disapproval.
Haruki blinked, caught off guard. She looked down at her sleeve, where streaks of red and green paint had dried into a messy splatter. Her fingers instinctively brushed her cheek, and she felt the faint crust of paint there too. “Oh,” she said, surprised. “It’s just paint…”
Her mother sighed, setting down her pen and removing her glasses. “Have you been painting again in that club of yours?”
“Yes, Mom,” Haruki said, her voice steady but defensive. “I’m the vice president of the club now, so I have to keep it running.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest. “You know…” she began, her tone softening but still firm, “you’re in your third year now. You’re about to finish high school. You can’t keep getting lost in your head anymore. One day, you’ll need to go to university, get a job, and support yourself.”
Haruki stayed silent, her jaw tightening. Inside, her heart was a storm of emotions. She wanted to argue, to shout that she could keep getting lost in her head, that she could make a living as an artist, that she could decide her own future. She was tired of being told what to do, tired of feeling like her dreams were nothing more than childish fantasies. But the words stuck in her throat, heavy and unspoken.
All she could muster was another quiet, “Yes, Mom.”
Her mother’s gaze lingered on her for a moment longer before she turned back to her laptop. The click-clacking of the keys resumed, filling the silence. But then her mother paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, and looked up again. “Have you received your Career Plan papers yet?” she asked, her tone casual but probing. “You should have gotten one by now.”
Haruki hesitated, then nodded. “Yes, I did.” She reached into her bag and pulled out the folded sheet of paper, holding it out reluctantly.
Her mother took it, scanning the form with a critical eye. “You should consider becoming a nurse, Haruki,” she said, her voice matter-of-fact. “The pay is good, and you said you don’t want to become a doctor. I think nursing would suit you.”
Haruki’s stomach twisted. She clenched her hands into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. “B-but I don’t want to become a nurse either, Mom,” she said, her voice trembling slightly.
Her mother’s eyes narrowed, and she set the paper down on the table. “Then what do you want to be?” she asked, her tone sharp.
There was a heavy silence between them, the air thick with tension. Haruki’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing. She knew what she wanted to say, but the words felt like a betrayal, like they would shatter the fragile peace between them. Still, she couldn’t hold it in any longer.
“I want to go to art school,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. “I want to become an artist.”
The room fell silent, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Her mother stared at her, her expression unreadable. For a moment, Haruki thought she might not have heard her. But then her mother’s lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes hardened.
“What?” her mother said finally, her voice low and incredulous.
Haruki flinched but stood her ground. “I want to go to art school,” she repeated, her voice firmer this time. “I want to study art and become an artist.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest. “An artist?” she said, her tone dripping with disbelief. “Haruki, do you hear yourself? Do you have any idea how difficult it is to make a living as an artist? How unstable that kind of life is?”
“I know it’s not easy,” Haruki said, her voice rising slightly. “But it’s what I love. It’s what I’m good at. I don’t want to spend my life doing something I hate just because it’s ‘stable.’”
Her mother’s eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her voice calm, which somehow made it worse. “You’re being naive, Haruki. Dreams don’t pay the bills. You need to think about your future, about how you’re going to support yourself.”
“I am thinking about my future!” Haruki shot back, her voice breaking. “I’m thinking about what makes me happy, not just what makes you happy!”
The words hung in the air, sharp and unyielding. Haruki’s chest heaved as she stared at her mother, her eyes burning with unshed tears. Her mother’s expression softened for a moment, but then she sighed and shook her head.
“You’ll understand one day,” she said, her voice tired. “When you’re older, you’ll see that I’m only trying to protect you.”
Haruki didn’t respond. She couldn’t. The lump in her throat was too big, the weight of her mother’s words too heavy. She turned and walked out of the dining room, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. As she climbed the stairs, her vision blurred with tears, but she blinked them away, refusing to let them fall.
When she reached her room, she closed the door behind her and leaned against it, sliding down to the floor. Her sketchbook lay on her desk, its pages filled with drawings and paintings that felt like pieces of her soul. She stared at it, her heart aching.
After a moment, she stood up and walked over to her desk, where her Career Plans paper lay crumpled at the edge. She smoothed it out, her fingers trembling slightly as she picked up a pen. Her mind raced, but for the first time in a long time, it felt clear. She knew what she wanted. She had always known.
With a deep breath, she wrote in neat, deliberate letters: Tokyo University Fine Arts Program.
Her hand shook as she set the pen down, but her resolve was steady. This was her choice. Her future. And no one—not her mother, not her father, not anyone—was going to take it away from her.
She stared at the paper for a long moment, the words staring back at her like a declaration of war. It was a small act of defiance, but it felt monumental. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt a flicker of hope.
“I’ll show them,” she whispered to herself, her voice trembling but determined. “I’ll prove them wrong.”
She folded the paper carefully and placed it back in her bag, ready to submit it tomorrow. As she sat down at her desk and opened her sketchbook, her heart felt lighter. The colors on the page seemed brighter, the lines sharper, as if they too were emboldened by her decision.
For now, all she could do was keep painting, keep dreaming. But this time, it felt different. This time, it felt like the beginning of something new.

            <Notes>Haruhi and Aiko said goodbye as they biked together

Haruhi arrived home

Haruhi then talks wit her Mother, 

After a while Haruki talks about the Career Plans

Honoka was a Teacher, not a housewife

Maybe she was supportive with Haruhi’s wish to become an Artist, but cautious on Nagano’s reaction</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 9 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The boys stopped and parked their motorcycles a short distance from the school, careful to follow the rules—students weren’t allowed to ride motorcycles directly onto school grounds. Nagano parked his bike alongside the others, and they all dismounted, slinging their bags over their shoulders as they began walking toward the school.
Haruki trailed behind them, her eyes scanning the familiar yet unfamiliar surroundings. The school building stood tall and imposing, its traditional architecture a stark contrast to the modern structure she knew. The walls were made of wood and plaster, their surfaces weathered but well-maintained. The windows were framed with brass, their panes gleaming in the morning light.
As they entered the school complex, Haruki’s heart sank. The layout was the same, but so much was different. The club room where she used to host the Arts Club—her sanctuary—wasn’t there. In her time, it had been on the floor above the gymnasium, but now that space was empty, just a blank wall where the door should have been. She supposed it hadn’t been built yet.
The group moved through the courtyard, their footsteps echoing on the cobblestone path. Haruki’s eyes darted around, taking in every detail. The school grounds were immaculate, the gardens neatly trimmed and the pathways spotless. It was a far cry from the slightly worn, modernized version she was used to.
As they stepped inside the school building, the differences became even more apparent. The floors were made of polished wood, their surfaces gleaming and squeaky clean. The walls were lined with brass fixtures, their surfaces gleaming in the light streaming through the windows. The air smelled of wood polish and fresh paper, a far cry from the faint scent of plastic and metal that permeated her school in the present.
Haruki’s footsteps echoed softly as she followed the group down the hallway. The classrooms were arranged in the same order she remembered, but the doors were made of solid wood, their surfaces carved with intricate designs. The students milling about wore uniforms similar to hers, but the fabrics were heavier, the styles more traditional.
Nagano glanced back at her, his grin wide and carefree. “First day jitters?” he asked, his tone teasing.
Haruki forced a smile, though her mind was still reeling. “Something like that,” she said, her voice quiet.
He laughed, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. Fukumitsu’s a great school.”
Haruki nodded, though her thoughts were elsewhere. She didn’t know how she was going to navigate this strange, unfamiliar version of her school. But one thing was clear: she couldn’t let herself get overwhelmed. She had to keep moving forward, no matter how surreal it all felt.
As they reached the staircase, Nagano turned to her. “What class are you in?”
Haruki hesitated, her mind racing. She didn’t know how the class system worked in this time, but she had to say something. “Uh… Class 1A,” she said, hoping it was the right answer.
Nagano’s grin widened. “No way! That’s my class too. C’mon, I’ll show you the way.”
Haruki followed him, her heart still racing from the surreal experience of being in this unfamiliar version of her school. But before they could take more than a few steps, a gruff voice stopped them in their tracks.
“Hold it right there!”
They froze, turning slowly to see a large man in a suit standing behind them. He carried a thick wooden ruler in one hand, his expression stern and unyielding. Nagano leaned over to Haruki and whispered, “That’s Mr. Genzo, the math teacher. He’s super strict. Don’t move.”
Mr. Genzo stepped forward, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed the group. “You’re all three minutes late,” he said, his voice sharp and cutting.
Three minutes?! Haruki thought to herself, her stomach tightening. In her time, being 15 minutes late was considered tardy, but here, even a few minutes were enough to draw his wrath.
Mr. Genzo began circling the group, his wooden ruler tapping ominously against his palm. He inspected each student’s uniform with a critical eye, and every time he spotted a discrepancy—no matter how small—he didn’t hesitate to strike. He hit Nagano on the arm for having sleeves that were too long. He smacked Sakura’s leg for her skirt being too short. The others weren’t spared either, each receiving a sharp rap for minor infractions.
Haruki’s heart pounded as Mr. Genzo approached her. She had heard stories from her teachers about how strict and brutal educators were in the past, but hearing about it was nothing compared to experiencing it firsthand. She stood stiffly, her hands clenched at her sides, as he stopped in front of her.
“Well, who is this?” Mr. Genzo said, his tone dripping with suspicion. “I’ve never seen you before.”
Haruki opened her mouth to respond, but no words came out. Her mind raced, trying to come up with an explanation, but before she could say anything, Nagano stepped forward.
“She’s a new student, sir,” he said quickly, his voice steady despite the tension in the air. “I heard there’s a new transfer student starting today. This must be her.”
Mr. Genzo’s eyes narrowed, and he studied Haruki closely. For a moment, it seemed like he didn’t believe Nagano’s story. He turned to one of the teachers standing nearby and whispered something to them. The teacher nodded and hurried off, presumably to check the records.
Mr. Genzo turned back to Haruki, his expression softening slightly. “I’m terribly sorry, Mrs. Fujiyama,” he said, his tone now polite and almost apologetic. “I didn’t know you were the new student. Please follow Mrs. Azuki to your classroom.”
Haruki blinked, stunned by the sudden change in his demeanor. “T-thank you,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.
Mr. Genzo nodded, then turned to Nagano and the others, his stern expression returning. “As for you lot,” he said, his voice sharp, “to the principal’s office. Now!”
Nagano and his friends exchanged resigned glances but didn’t argue. They turned and walked away, their shoulders slumped as they headed toward the principal’s office.
Haruki watched them go, her heart aching with guilt. Nagano had stood up for her, and now he was paying the price. She wanted to say something, to thank him or apologize, but before she could, Mrs. Azuki—a kind-looking woman with glasses—gestured for her to follow.
“This way, dear,” Mrs. Azuki said, her voice warm and reassuring.
Haruki nodded and followed her down the hallway, her mind still reeling from what had just happened. As they walked, she couldn’t help but glance back at Nagano and his friends, who were disappearing around the corner.
Mr. Genzo’s final words echoed in her mind: “Next time, I suggest you stay away from these lackeys. There are better students in your classroom.”
Haruki clenched her fists, a flicker of defiance sparking in her chest. She didn’t care what Mr. Genzo thought. Nagano and his friends had been kind to her, and she wasn’t going to abandon them just because they didn’t fit someone else’s idea of “better.”
For now, though, all she could do was follow Mrs. Azuki, her heart heavy with the weight of everything that had happened—and everything that was yet to come.</Text>
            <Notes>The gang then stopped by the principal for being late, 

He was about to punish the gang,

As his eyes narrowed to Haruki, she gets nervous, he never saw her before.

Nagano then stood up for her, saying that Haruki was a new student, he heard there’s a new transfer student coming up, so he asked her to come with him

The Principal then forgives Haruki, but punishes the rest of the gang

Then another teacher was escorting her to one of her class

She introduces herself

Then she sat on one of the desk,

A girl next to her asked, whether she is related to Nagano Fujiyama

Haruki then lied, saying that she isn’t she just share the same surname

The girl then introduced herself to Haruki

She’s Honoka Aoki, she’s the school’s Literature Club writer

She’s her mother</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 13 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki was fast asleep, her breathing steady as she sprawled on the iron-framed bed. The events of the previous day had left her exhausted, and she had fallen into a deep, dreamless sleep. The cabin was quiet, the only sound the faint rustling of leaves outside the window.
But then, a knock broke the silence.
It was soft at first, almost tentative—a single tap on the window. Haruki stirred slightly, her brow furrowing, but she didn’t wake. A moment later, the knock came again, louder this time.
Haruki groaned, pulling the pillow over her face. “Go away,” she mumbled, her voice muffled.
The knocking persisted, growing more insistent. Tap. Tap. Tap.
Haruki sat up suddenly, her hair a mess and her eyes bleary with sleep. “What is it?” she snapped, her voice tinged with annoyance. She glared at the window, but the curtains were drawn, and she couldn’t see who—or what—was outside.
With a sigh, she threw off the covers and swung her legs over the side of the bed. Her feet hit the cool wooden floor, and she shuffled toward the door, rubbing her eyes. She unlocked it and pulled it open, squinting against the early morning light.
Standing on the doorstep was a figure she hadn’t expected to see.
It was Sakura, standing on the doorstep with a bright smile. Behind her, the boys from the motorcycle gang were gathered, chatting and laughing. Nagano was among them, his guitar slung over his shoulder. When he saw Haruki open the door, he waved enthusiastically.
“Morning, Haruki-chan!” he called, his grin wide and carefree.
Haruki blinked, still groggy from sleep. “What… what are you all doing here?” she asked, her voice tinged with confusion.
Sakura stepped forward, her hands clasped behind her back. “We thought you lived somewhere close by, so we decided to visit,” she explained. “Or, more accurately, Nagano-kun took quite a liking to you and decided to invite you to spend Saturday with us.”
Haruki stared at her, trying to process what she was hearing. “Wait, what?” she said, her voice slow and disbelieving. Maybe it was the grogginess, but this felt like something out of a dream.
Nagano stepped forward, his hands in his pockets. “Well, you’re new here, right?” he said, his tone casual but kind. “It’s important to have friends you can depend on. And honestly, you are rebellious and impulsive, I think you’ll fit with us.” He grinned, clearly teasing her.
Haruki chuckled, taking it as a compliment. “Thanks, I think,” she said, her lips curling into a small smile.
Sakura glanced past Haruki into the cabin, her expression curious. “By the way, does your grandfather mind if you come with us? We heard you live with your grandparents. We don’t want to get you in trouble.”
Haruki froze for a moment, her mind racing. She had completely forgotten about the lie she had told about living with her grandfather. Thinking quickly, she turned her head slightly and called into the empty cabin, “Grandpa, is it okay if I go out with my friends? I’ll be back before nightfall!”
She paused for a moment, as if listening to a response, then turned back to Sakura with a sheepish smile. “He says it’s fine, as long as I’m back before dark.”
Nagano, leaning against his motorcycle with his usual careless grin, chimed in. “Maybe you can just sneak out, Haruki. Your old man wouldn’t know.” He winked, clearly teasing her.
Sakura shot him a disapproving look, her hands on her hips. “You’re horrible! Haruki could get in trouble!”
Nagano shrugged, unfazed. “I sneak out all the time. My old man doesn’t care. He’s too busy with work to notice, anyway.”
Sakura rolled her eyes. “You definitely don’t know what it’s like to be a girl, Nagano. We can’t just do whatever we want. People talk, and it’s always us who get blamed.”
Nagano raised an eyebrow, his grin fading slightly. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. It’s not fair, but that’s just how it is, huh?”
 “Alright then,” she said, turning back to Haruki. “Go get ready. We’ll wait by the road at our usual spot.”
Haruki nodded and closed the door, leaning against it for a moment as she let out a quiet sigh of relief. That had been close. She hurried to the bedroom.
Haruki opened the wardrobe in her bedroom, discovering that the clothes there all looked vintage. Well, they were vintage—or rather, they were the height of fashion in this time. But to her, they looked old-fashioned and unfamiliar. Haruki was used to her baggy hoodie, skinny jeans, and sneakers, but it seemed that style of fashion hadn’t made its way to 1961 yet. With a sigh, she pulled out a plain polo shirt, a cardigan, and one of the skirts that seemed to dominate the wardrobe. She slipped them on, feeling oddly out of place in her own skin.
Standing in front of the mirror, she paused. The reflection staring back at her looked… different. The polo shirt and skirt gave her a polished, almost prim appearance, and the cardigan softened her edges in a way that felt strangely comforting. But what struck her most was how much she resembled her mother. It shouldn’t have surprised her—Honoka probably dressed the same way at this age—but the realization still caught her off guard. For a moment, she felt a pang of something she couldn’t quite name. Longing? Nostalgia? Or maybe just the bittersweet ache of seeing herself in someone she thought she knew so little about.
Shaking off the thought, Haruki grabbed her sketchbook and tucked it under her arm. She didn’t know where they were going, but she wasn’t about to leave without it. Taking a deep breath, she walked out the door and joined her friends.
The group was waiting by the road, their motorcycles gleaming in the morning sun. Nagano was leaning against his bike, strumming his guitar absently, while Sakura chatted with the other boys. When Haruki approached, Sakura turned and smiled.
“There you are! You look nice,” she said, her tone warm and genuine.
Haruki glanced down at her outfit, feeling self-conscious. “Thanks. I guess this is what everyone wears here, huh?”
Nagano looked up from his guitar, his eyes scanning her with a playful grin. “Yeah, but you make it look cool. Not everyone can pull off the ‘serious student’ look.”
Haruki rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t help smiling. “Thanks, I think.”
Sakura laughed, linking her arm with Haruki’s. “Don’t mind him. He thinks he’s funny, but we all know better.”
Nagano feigned offense, clutching his chest dramatically. “Ouch, Sakura. You wound me.”
The group erupted into laughter, and Haruki felt a flicker of warmth in her chest. It was strange, being here with these people who felt so familiar yet so different from the parents she knew. 
“So, where are we going?” Haruki asked, glancing around at the group.
Nagano slung his guitar over his shoulder and hopped onto his motorcycle. “It’s a surprise. But trust me, you’re gonna love it.”
Sakura nudged Haruki gently. “Don’t worry, we’ll take care of you. Just hold on tight, okay?”
Haruki nodded, though a small knot of nervousness tightened in her stomach. She’d never ridden a motorcycle before, and the idea of speeding through the countryside with Nagano at the helm was equal parts thrilling and terrifying.
As the engines roared to life, Haruki climbed onto the back of Nagano’s bike. The wind tugged at her hair as they sped down the road, the world blurring into a kaleidoscope of green fields and blue sky. For a moment, she forgot about the lies, the secrets, and the weight of her situation. She was just Haruki, a girl on an adventure with her friends, and for now, that was enough.

-o-

Haruki tagged along with her newfound friends, the warmth of the morning sun on her skin and the promise of adventure in the air. The day unfolded like a dream, each moment blending into the next in a whirlwind of laughter and shared experiences.
Their first stop was a dusty baseball field on the outskirts of town. The gang spread out across the field, their shouts and laughter echoing in the open space. Haruki had never been much of an athlete, but the energy was infectious. Nagano handed her a bat, his grin wide and encouraging.
“Come on, Haruki-chan! Show us what you’ve got!” he called, tossing a ball into the air.
Haruki gripped the bat, her heart pounding with a mix of excitement and nervousness. The first few swings were clumsy, the bat cutting through empty air, but then—crack! The ball soared into the sky, and the group erupted into cheers. Haruki’s face lit up with a grin as she ran the bases, her feet kicking up clouds of dust. She even managed to catch a few balls, her hands stinging from the impact but her spirits soaring. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt carefree, like she belonged.
By noon, they made their way to the port town, the salty breeze tugging at their hair. Haruki had never been here before, not even in her own time. The sight took her breath away—rows of ships bobbing gently in the harbor, their masts reaching toward the sky like skeletal fingers. The water sparkled under the midday sun, and the air was filled with the sounds of seagulls and distant chatter. They found a spot to sit and unpacked their lunches, sharing stories and jokes as they ate. Haruki couldn’t help but marvel at how alive everything felt, how different it was from the quiet, almost ghostly port she knew in the future.
As the afternoon faded into evening, they headed to the beach. The sand was warm beneath their feet, and the waves lapped gently at the shore. Someone produced a volleyball, and soon they were diving and laughing, their shouts mingling with the sound of the surf. Haruki played with abandon, her cheeks flushed and her hair wild. When the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of purple and orange, they finally stopped to catch their breath. They sat together on the sand, watching the sun sink into the sea, the world bathed in a golden glow. Haruki felt a quiet contentment settle over her, a sense of peace she hadn’t known she was missing.
As the last light faded, they made their way back to the usual spot near the forest, not far from Haruki’s cabin. Nagano and his friends revved their engines, ready to head home, but Haruki hesitated. She caught Nagano’s eye and gestured for him to stay.
“Can I talk to you for a minute?” she asked, her voice soft but steady.
Nagano nodded, waving his friends on. “Go ahead, I’ll catch up,” he called. The others roared off into the night, their laughter fading into the distance.
Haruki led Nagano to a small wooden shelter near the edge of the forest. The air was cool now, the scent of pine and earth filling her lungs. She sat down on the bench, her hands clasped in her lap, and Nagano settled beside her, his guitar resting against his knee.
Nagano teased her, a mischievous glint in his eye. “What is this, a confession from the new girl?”
Haruki’s cheeks flushed, and she shot him a look. “What, no! You’re weird!” she retorted, though there was no real heat in her words. It was strange, bantering with someone who was technically her father—or at least, the younger version of him. The thought made her stomach twist with a mix of amusement and unease.
Nagano held up his hands in mock surrender. “Okay, okay, geez. I was just kidding.” He leaned back, his tone softening. “So, what’s on your mind?”
Haruki took a deep breath, her heart pounding. This was it—the moment she’d been waiting for. She turned to him, her eyes searching his face in the dim light. “I just… I wanted to thank you. For today. It was… amazing.”
Nagano grinned, his usual carefree self. “Hey, no need to thank me. You’re one of us now, remember?”
“Yeah…” Haruki smiled, though her chest felt tight. She looked away, her gaze drifting to the fireflies that had begun to gather in the bushes around them. Their tiny lights flickered like stars, casting a soft glow over the clearing. The cicadas’ rhythmic chirping filled the air, a soothing backdrop to the silence that settled between them.
For a while, they just sat there, side by side, watching as the town below began to light up. The orange glow of gas lamps and fluorescent lights spread like a warm blanket over the landscape, contrasting with the cool, dark forest around them. Haruki felt a strange sense of peace, as if the world had paused just for this moment.
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Nagano said quietly, his voice almost a whisper.
Haruki nodded, her throat too tight to speak. She wanted to say more—to tell him how much this day had meant to her, how much he meant to her, even if he didn’t know it yet. But the words stuck in her throat, tangled up with the fear of saying too much, of revealing the truth she couldn’t yet share.
Instead, she glanced at him, taking in the way the faint light softened his features. He looked so young, so full of life, so different from the stern, distant man she knew in the future. It was hard to reconcile the two versions of him in her mind—the carefree boy sitting beside her and the father who had always seemed so unapproachable.
“Nagano-kun,” she began hesitantly, “do you ever think about the future? About what you want your life to be like?”
Nagano gave a dry laugh, the sound hollow and tinged with bitterness. “I don’t need to think about it,” he said, leaning back against the wooden bench. “It’s already been decided for me since I was born.”
Haruki frowned, her chest tightening. “What do you mean?”
“I’ll be taking my father’s position as the chairman of his automotive company,” Nagano replied, his tone matter-of-fact, as if he were reciting a script he’d memorized long ago.
The words hit Haruki like a punch to the gut. Of course—that was her father’s job in the present. The job that had consumed his life, leaving little room for anything else. She remembered the long nights he’d spent at the office, the weekends he’d missed, the way he’d always seemed so distant, so tired. It was a life she had resented, but now, hearing Nagano speak about it with such resignation, she felt a pang of guilt. This was the weight he had carried, even before she was born.
Nagano continued, his voice low and tinged with a quiet sadness. “After high school, this’ll probably be the last bit of fun I’ll have in my life. My father wants me to continue the company. He wants me to study engineering and economics, then take over when he retires.”
Haruki’s heart ached for him. “Can’t you just… say no?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Nagano shook his head, his expression grim. “I don’t have a choice. My father built that company from the ground up, even since the war. He survived all of that—the bombings, the hunger, the loss—and he made something out of nothing. I can’t just throw that away. I don’t want to disappoint him. And if I fail…” He trailed off, his gaze dropping to the ground. “If I fail, I don’t want to drag my family down with me for generations.”
Haruki felt a lump rise in her throat. She had never thought about it like that—about the sacrifices her father had made, the weight of his responsibilities. She had only seen the man who was never there, not the boy who had given up his dreams to carry the burden of his family’s legacy.
“Nagano-kun,” she said softly, “if you had a choice… what would you want to become?”
For a moment, Nagano was silent, his fingers absently tracing the edge of his guitar. Then, a small smile tugged at his lips, and his eyes lit up with a dreamy, faraway look. “A musician,” he said, his voice soft but full of longing. “I’d want to play in front of a big crowd one day, to see people laughing and dancing and having fun because of my music. That’s the dream, you know? To make people happy with something I created.”
Haruki’s chest tightened as she watched him. For the first time, she saw the passion in his eyes, the spark of something that had been buried under layers of duty and expectation. But just as quickly as it had appeared, the light in his eyes dimmed, and his expression turned somber.
“But it’s just a dream,” he said, his voice heavy with resignation. “Once high school is over, I’ll have to abandon my guitar, sell my motorcycle, and go to university to study engineering. That’s just how it is.”
The finality in his words made Haruki’s heart ache. She wanted to say something—to tell him that he didn’t have to give up, that he could chase his dreams and still make his father proud. But the words stuck in her throat. How could she, of all people, tell him that? She knew how his story ended, and it wasn’t with a stage and a cheering crowd.
Nagano stood up, brushing off his pants and grabbing the keys to his motorcycle. “Well then, sorry to make the atmosphere so blue,” he said, forcing a faint chuckle. “You have to go home too, Haruki. It’s already late, and your old man will—”
But before he could finish, Haruki scrambled to her feet, her heart pounding in her chest. She took a quick step forward, closing the distance between them, and before Nagano could react, she threw her arms around him in a tight, desperate hug. Her face pressed into his striped shirt, the fabric soft against her tear-streaked cheeks. Nagano recoiled slightly, caught off guard, his body leaning back against his motorcycle for balance. 
“H-hey, what are you—?” Nagano stammered, his arms hovering awkwardly at his sides.
“I’m sorry you have to go through all of that,” Haruki said, her voice cracking. She buried her face deeper into his shirt, her tears soaking into the fabric. “I didn’t know how much you sacrificed, or how heavy the weight is on your shoulders.”
Nagano hesitated, then slowly brought his arms up to pat her back. “H-hey now,” he said, his voice softer now, “it’s nothing for you to worry about, Haruki. I can always manage, you know?”
But Haruki didn’t let go. She clung to him, her fingers gripping the back of his shirt as if she could somehow anchor him to this moment, to this version of himself. She couldn’t remember the last time she had hugged her father in the present—the real Nagano, the one who was always too busy, too distant. The last time might have been when she was a little girl, scraped and crying after falling during a game of tag. She remembered how he had rushed to her then, scooping her up and holding her close, his hand patting her back just like this. And she remembered the words he had always said to her, the words that now echoed in her mind as Nagano spoke them.
“Calm down now,” Nagano said, his voice gentle as he patted her back. “No need to be sad. Everything is okay.”
Haruki’s chest tightened, and for a moment, she couldn’t breathe. She wanted to stay like this forever, to hold onto this version of her father who was still kind, still hopeful, still dreaming. But eventually, she pulled away, her face a mess of tears and snot. She wiped her cheeks with the sleeve of her cardigan, sniffing loudly.
“I’m sorry, I—” she stammered, her voice trembling.
“Look, it’s okay,” Nagano said, his tone reassuring. “It’s sad, I know.”
Then, as if to lighten the mood, he flashed her a teasing smile. “Because, you know, if I did become a musician, who knows? I might accidentally sweep you off your feet.”
Haruki’s sniffles turned into a laugh, and she gave him a playful shove. “You are the worst!”
Both of them laughed, the sound echoing in the quiet night. For a moment, the weight of everything—the lies, the secrets, the unspoken truths—felt a little lighter.
“Alright now,” Nagano said, mounting his motorcycle and starting the engine. “You should go home. Your grandpa might already be looking for you.” He put on his helmet, his voice muffled but still teasing. “And wipe your tears while you’re at it. If your gramps finds out I made you cry, he might start hunting me down.”
Haruki chuckled, wiping her face with her cardigan. She watched as Nagano revved the engine, the sound cutting through the stillness of the night. He gave her a quick wave before driving off, his silhouette growing smaller and smaller as he disappeared down the road.
Haruki stood there for a moment, the cool night air brushing against her skin. The fireflies still flickered around her, their tiny lights dancing in the darkness. She took a deep breath, the scent of pine and earth filling her lungs, and began the walk back to the cabin.
As she walked, her mind replayed the evening—the laughter, the tears, the way Nagano had patted her back just like her father used to. She thought about his dreams, his resignation, and the weight he carried. And she thought about her own role in all of this. Could she change anything? Could she help him hold onto the part of himself that still dreamed, even if it was just a little?</Text>
            <Notes>Haruki was fast asleep, but woken up by a knock on the window, once… then twice…

She then opened the door, it was Sakura, and behind her were the boys, they said that they thought she lived somewhere close and decided to visit

The gang then invited her to hang out with them, it’s saturday and they got some free time, they asked whether her grandpa would allow it

Haruki, then sheepishly fake-asking her non-existent grandpa in the cabin, In which she said that she was allowed, only if she return before night time

Haruki got out and explored the city of 1960s Japan

There she had fun with her friends and Nagano

There is a moment where her friends watched the city on top of the hill by the cliff, 

Where Haruki talks heart-to-heart with with Nagano

Nagano said that after high-school, it will probably the last bit of fun he will have. His father wants him to continue his automotive company, he wants him to study engineering and takes him over when he retires

Haruki asked couldn’t he just say no?

Nagano said he has no choice,</Notes>

            <Text>The school gates cast long shadows across the bicycle racks as Haruki wheeled her bike out, the chain clicking softly in time with her steps. Aiko and Akihito fell into stride beside her—Aiko bouncing on her toes with barely-contained curiosity, Akihito adjusting his glasses with his usual calm.
Haruki hummed a tuneless melody, her lips curled into a smirk that made Aiko narrow her eyes.
&quot;So?&quot; Aiko prodded, swinging her bag like a pendulum. &quot;What did Mrs. Matsuoka want? Career Plan interrogation? Tomorrow's plein air logistics? Or just her usual lavender tea torture session?&quot;
Haruki's smirk widened. She brought a finger to her lips. &quot;S.e.c.r.e.t.&quot; She drew out each letter, popping the 't' with relish.
Aiko's bag hit the pavement with a thud. &quot;Haruki.&quot; She planted herself in front of the bike, blocking their path. &quot;As your vice-president—no, as your friend—I demand full disclosure!&quot; She jabbed a finger at Akihito. &quot;And he does too, right?&quot;
Akihito sighed, though the corner of his mouth twitched. &quot;I'm merely here to ensure you two don't cause a scene.&quot;
Haruki laughed, the sound bright against the quiet hum of cicadas. Then—with a sudden burst of energy—she kicked off on her bike, sailing past Aiko in a blur of motion.
&quot;Hey!&quot; Aiko scrambled after her, sandals slapping against the pavement. Akihito followed at a more dignified pace, though his long strides kept him close.
Haruki skidded to a stop a few meters ahead, the evening sun setting her dark curls ablaze. She leaned forward, her hair tumbling like a cascade of ink as she grinned back at them. The golden light outlined her silhouette, painting the edges of her uniform in fire.
&quot;I know what to put in my Career Plans paper,&quot; she announced, voice brimming with a confidence that hadn't been there an hour ago.
Aiko froze mid-step. Even Akihito's eyebrows lifted.
Haruki didn't wait for their reaction. With a final, triumphant laugh, she pushed off again, her bike cutting through the sunset-drenched path like an arrow released from a bow. Behind her, Aiko's indignant screech echoed across the schoolyard—
&quot;Haruki Fujiyama, you get back here right now!&quot;

-o-

The sky was a deep shade of purple, streaked with the last remnants of orange as the sun dipped below the horizon. Haruki pedaled her bicycle alongside Aiko and Akihito, the cool evening air brushing against her face. The streets were quiet, save for the occasional hum of a passing car or the distant laughter of children playing in a nearby park. Their conversation drifted between idle chatter and the lingering weight of their discussion in the art room, though none of them spoke about Matsuda again.
Eventually, they reached the point where their paths diverged. Aiko stretched her arms above her head before turning down her street. “See you tomorrow, Haruki-chan! Don’t forget to submit that paper!”
Haruki laughed lightly. “I won’t! See you!”
As Aiko disappeared around the corner, Haruki turned her bike toward her own street.
The last streaks of sunset bled into twilight as Haruki and Akihito pedaled along the narrow road flanked by rice fields. The evening air carried the damp earthiness of irrigated soil.
Haruki tilted her face into the wind, letting its breeze blow through her short, curly hair. Beside her, Akihito rode with his usual quiet precision—hands at ten-and-two, posture straight as a ruler. The only sound between them was the steady click-click of their gears and the occasional plop of a frog leaping into the paddies.
They rode on. The road curved gently, revealing the first scattered lights of the neighborhood ahead. Somewhere beyond the fields, a train whistle sounded—low and mournful, the evening express heading north.
Haruki’s fingers tightened on her grips. The Career Plan form seemed to burn in her bag, heavier than all her art supplies combined. She opened her mouth—to say what, she wasn’t sure—but the moment passed.
Akihito slowed as they reached the fork where their paths split. He didn’t ask about the paper. Didn’t need to. The look he gave her was enough—patient, knowing, infuriatingly observant as always.
Haruki grinned and kicked off again before he could speak. “Don’t work too hard tonight, secretary!”
The wind rushed past her ears, nearly drowning out Akihito's sudden call—
&quot;Haruki—wait.&quot;
Her bicycle screeched to a halt, the front wheel wobbling. She turned, eyebrows raised. Akihito stood frozen at the fork in the road, his silhouette rigid against the amber glow of a newly lit streetlamp.
&quot;You're not... thinking of doing what I think you are doing, are you?&quot; His voice was uncharacteristically tight.
Haruki blinked. &quot;Huh?&quot;
&quot;You're thinking of putting art school on your Career Plan, aren't you?&quot;
A moth fluttered violently around the streetlamp above them. Haruki's grip on the handlebars loosened. 
&quot;Well, umm—&quot; She laughed, scratching the back of her neck where her curls stuck to her skin. &quot;It was just... a random thought, y'know?&quot;
Akihito exhaled through his nose. For once, his usual composure cracked.
&quot;Look,&quot; he finally said, stepping closer. The gravel crunched under his shoes. &quot;You're a great artist. No one's denying that.&quot; He hesitated, then lowered his voice, though the empty fields left no one to overhear. &quot;But...&quot;
&quot;What I'm worried about,&quot; he murmured, &quot;is your father.&quot;
Haruki's bicycle creaked as she shifted her weight. The streetlamp above them buzzed softly, casting jagged shadows across Akihito's usually composed face. 
&quot;What about my father?&quot; Haruki asked, her voice lighter than she felt.
&quot;Don't be reckless.&quot; He adjusted his glasses—a nervous habit Haruki hadn't seen since their first-year exams. &quot;My father was friends with yours in high school. Worked with him for a time too.&quot;
&quot;He's not...&quot; Akihito hesitated, choosing his words like one might handle brittle charcoal. &quot;My father always said yours is... a dangerous man to cross.&quot; 
Somewhere in the rice fields, water trickled between the paddies. The sound seemed too loud in the sudden silence.
Haruki forced a laugh. &quot;Oh come on, he's just strict—&quot;
&quot;Haruki… Remember when you sprained your wrist last spring?&quot; His voice dropped lower. &quot;The way you panicked when we asked if your parents should pick you up from the clinic? Or how you always change the subject when Aiko asks about your house?&quot;
Akihito sighed, his shoulders slumping. &quot;Just... talk to your mother first, alright?&quot; He met her eyes, and for once, his gaze wasn't analytical—it was frightened. &quot;You're as talented as you are impulsive. And I—&quot; He swallowed. &quot;We can't lose our president again.&quot;
The distant laughter of children from the park floated across the fields, jarringly bright against the heavy quiet between them.
For a moment, Akihito’s usual composure cracked—just enough for Haruki to see the raw worry beneath. The streetlamp’s harsh light bounced off his glasses, obscuring his eyes at first, but as he turned his head slightly, the glare shifted. 
What she saw there made her breath catch: his brows were furrowed, his lips pressed into a thin line. Not judgment, not his usual dry exasperation—just genuine, unfiltered concern.
Haruki’s chest tightened. Then, with practiced ease, she forced a grin and swung her fist lightly at his arm. Thump.
&quot;Ow,&quot; Akihito deadpanned, not even flinching.
&quot;Just relax,&quot; Haruki said, her voice deliberately bright. She spun her bike’s front wheel with her free hand, the spokes clicking like a metronome. &quot;I can always manage. The faster I get the papers done, the less time Mrs. Matsuoka will take to review them—&quot; She wiggled her eyebrows. &quot;—and the more time she’ll have to join our plein air sessions, right?&quot;
The streetlamp above them buzzed, its orange glow catching the dust motes swirling between them. Akihito didn't smile, but something in his posture softened - just slightly - at her stubborn optimism.
Before he could respond, Haruki swung her bike around with a scrape of tires against pavement. 
&quot;See you tomorrow, worrywart!&quot; she called over her shoulder, already pushing off. One hand lifted in a wave without looking back, her dark curls bouncing with each pedal.
Akihito remained standing at the intersection, his shadow stretching long and thin across the empty road. He watched until Haruki's figure grew small in the distance, the rhythmic blink of her bicycle reflector fading like a dying firefly.
Only then did he turn toward his own path, the sound of his footsteps drowned out by the evening chorus of crickets. The two of them moving further apart with each passing second - one bathed in the warm yellow light of house windows, the other disappearing into the blue-hued twilight.

            <Title>Chapter 22 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The next day found them pressed against the weathered brick wall near the school courtyard, their uniforms rumpled from crouching too long. Honoka's fingers trembled around the chilled soda bottle, condensation dripping onto her carefully polished loafers. Haruki could practically hear the frantic calculations whirring behind her friend's furrowed brow.
&quot;It's okay, Honoka-chan,&quot; Haruki whispered, patting her shoulder with far more confidence than she felt. &quot;Just give him the soda. It'll get you talking! He loves this stuff!&quot;
But Honoka had already spiraled into catastrophe scenarios. &quot;What if he thinks I'm weird? What if I drop it? What if—&quot; Her voice hitched. &quot;What if his friends start laughing and he laughs too and—&quot;
&quot;You're thinking way too much about this!&quot; Haruki interrupted, peeking around the corner. The sunlight caught on Nagano's guitar case as he ambled across the courtyard, his usual entourage of motorcycle friends trailing behind him. &quot;Look! It's him! It's your cue!&quot;
Before Honoka could protest further, Haruki gave her a firm push between the shoulder blades—sending her stumbling into the open with all the grace of a startled deer.
From her hiding spot behind the rusty water fountain, Haruki watched as Honoka straightened her blazer, still buttoned despite the sweltering heat. and began the long march across the sunbaked courtyard. Every step seemed painfully deliberate, like she was walking toward her own execution rather than a baseball field shelter. The way her polished loafers hesitated before touching the dirt path reminded Haruki of someone testing icy water.
Come on, you've got this! Haruki mouthed, giving an exaggerated thumbs-up when Honoka glanced back for the third time. Her friend's expression—somewhere between nausea and sheer terror—would've been hilarious if it wasn't so heartbreaking.
As Honoka reached the shelter's shadow, her nose immediately wrinkling at the assault of odors: leather mitts left too long in lockers, the sharp tang of  sweat, and beneath it all, the earthy scent of freshly turned dirt from the field. Five boys lounged on the benches in various states of undress—sleeves rolled haphazardly, ties hanging loose like nooses, towels draped around necks. One was using his blazer as a makeshift pillow.
&quot;Um... Excuse me,&quot; Honoka's voice came out smaller than she intended. When no one noticed, she cleared her throat and tried again, fingers tightening around the soda bottle. &quot;Is Nagano Fujiyama here?&quot;
The chatter died instantly. Five pairs of eyes swiveled to stare at the anomaly before them—a proper honors student in full uniform, standing stiff as a paper doll in their sweaty sanctuary. Someone whistled low under their breath.
From the back of the shelter, a familiar head of messy brown hair popped up. Nagano blinked sweat from his eyes, his guitar pick still wedged between his lips. When he recognized Honoka, he nearly choked on it.
&quot;Aoki-san?&quot; He scrambled upright, hastily buttoning his wrinkled dress shirt. &quot;What are you—I mean—&quot; His eyes darted to the soda in her hands, then to his snickering friends, then back to her face which was now the color of cherry blossoms in full bloom. &quot;Did you... want something?&quot;
Honoka's mouth opened, but the carefully rehearsed speech about music collaborations evaporated under the collective gaze of Nagano's motorcycle gang. The soda bottle made an ominous cracking sound under her grip.
Honoka stiffened like a marionette with its strings pulled taut. The shelter's wooden beams creaked in the summer heat as she stood there—a perfectly pressed island of propriety amidst the sea of disheveled masculinity. Where the boys' shirts clung to their backs with sweat, her blazer remained impeccably buttoned. Where their socks pooled around their ankles, her knee-highs stayed precisely aligned. Even her nervous swallow looked more refined than their boisterous laughter.
&quot;I want to talk to you about something,&quot; Honoka stammered, her fingers leaving damp prints on the soda bottle.
Nagano leaned against the shelter post, his grin easy. &quot;Oh, did Mrs. Kobayashi need something from me again?&quot; He winked at his friends, who erupted in knowing chuckles. Everyone remembered when Honoka had recruited him to move heavy anthologies last month—the only time they'd ever spoken alone.
The silence stretched like taffy. Honoka's lips moved soundlessly as Nagano's smile gradually faltered. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, catching sunlight as it fell.
&quot;N-no,&quot; she finally managed, her voice barely above a whisper yet somehow carrying across the suddenly quiet field. &quot;I want to talk to you personally.&quot;
The shelter exploded in raucous cheers. Baseball mitts hit the dirt as players abandoned their game. Someone wolf-whistled so sharply it startled sparrows from the nearby trees. Within seconds, what had been a private conversation became spectator sport, with students materializing from every direction like moths to flame.
From behind the water fountain, Haruki slapped both hands over her face. Why didn't you just lie? she groaned into her palms. But even as she said it, she knew—this was Honoka Aoki. The girl who returned lost yen coins to teachers. Who apologized to library books when turning pages too quickly. Of course she couldn't lie.
All eyes locked onto the mismatched pair: the prim literature club princess and the motorcycle gang's golden boy. Honoka looked ready to dissolve into the dirt, while Nagano's usual confidence flickered under the unexpected spotlight.
Then—with a clap that silenced the crowd—Nagano tossed his bat aside. &quot;Alright,&quot; he announced, rolling his shoulders back. &quot;Come on, guys.&quot; He shooed his friends with both hands. &quot;Give us some space!&quot;
The collective groan of disappointment could've been heard across the prefecture.</Text>

Fun and games II :
Explore Honoka

Fun and Games III : 
Explore Nagano

Maybe one day, Haruki got a heart to heart talk with Nagano, and she asked about if one day he had a kid, how will he raise that kid. How he felt

Nagano thought the question is weird, but he had known that Haruki is a weird, but eccentric girl, so he entertained the question

He told her about how much he will sacrifice for her, so she can have a good life, how he don’t mind working a slave-like corporate job so his daughter can live freely, he is sick of how much his own father dictates how he should live. He wouldn’t want that to happen to anyone.

	Pinch Point 1 : She tried to to go back to the portal, trying to jump in it multiple times, doing nose dives and jumps and falling over and over again, she miss her home, she miss her time, she broke down crying.

	Midpoint : She met with another Time Traveller, who said that she was a Time Traveller like her, but her portal closes before she could accomplish her task. The Time Traveller said that the Time Warden ocassionally did this and gave them a task to complete before sun down. 
	
	When she wants to go through the portal again, she failed. Someone watches her failure, near the portal tree there is a painter, she was painting with her kit and asking her about it.
	
	The Painter asked Haruki to go with her for a coffee nearby. She talked about her about her circumtance, The Painter asked her whether she was a Time Traveller from the 2000s, and Haruki noded, the Painter talked about her past too, saying that she too, was a Time Traveller, she had an argument with her father and then stormed off the house into the portal just like she did. 

	But unlike her, she did not accomplish her task by the changing of the season. 

	Break into 3 : She goes back to school.
Ten | Autumn | ten (転)': twist, where 転 can mean revolve, turn around, change 

	Bad Guys Close in : It was about evening time, the portal was about to close.

	This time, Haruki was going back to school, Autumn is about to end, and so does her portal back, and so she had to act fast, and find a way to get Nagano and Honoka together.



	Pinch Point 2 : Haruki trues to hook up Honoka and Nagano using conventional means and the methods advised by Matsuda 

	All is Lost : Haruki discovers that Nagano didn’t feel the same way towards Honoka, and even worse. Honoka thought that her gesture of trying to hook them both as Haruki trying to get close to Nagano, in which made Honoka dislike Haruki

	Darkest Night : There at night she sat on the porch

	Haruki looking depressed before Matsuda came in.

		There Haruki said that Nagano didn’t feel the same way towards Honoka, and she might be doomed to be stuck at this time forever

	Matsuda jokingly said that there is nothing wrong with that, she just have to adjust accordingly

	But Haruki is determined to go back

	There Matsuda asked Haruki what does Nagano curently loves

	Haruki said that he loves music,

	“Then introduce her through music.”

		-o-

		Haruki then made a plan to get Nagano on the stage at the end of Summer, this is her only chance, if she fails, there is no going back

	Haruki then proposes the idea to Nagano, in which he excitedly agreed, but they needed a Lyricist. That is where Honoka came in.

	For several weeks, Haruki, Honoka and Nagano huddled in the storage room that would be the Arts Club room, making ideas for Lyrics. 

	After some time, Haruki notices that Nagano and Honoka began going to the storage room a lot, even without her, even making excuses so they can be alone just both of them

	-o-

	The Summer Festival, it was the end of Summer, 

		Nagano had brought together some of his friends to play together with him, some from the band club.

		The Summer Festival Concert featuring Nagano

Gathering the team:
They all prepared themselves

Executing the plan:
	The performance

High tower surprise:
	Haruki lost sight of Honoka and Nagano, Haruki now frantically looking for them, plotting since its her last chance before the door closes completely

	Haruki found Honoka and Nagano talking in an empty classroom, at first she wants to interfere for them to get on with it

But then what Haruki have to do is just to observe, they talked about their dream, about their passion of their hobby, and then… they kissed. 

They hung out in Haruki’s cabin and talked, they took a photo of them three. they talked about their parents, and Haruki about hers

Then Haruki said, asking her parents to be kind to her in the future.

Haruki went home and opened the door, it clicks.

	-o-

	The three of them hanging out in Haruki’s cabin, they had a deep conversation

	In which at the end, as they prepared to get out, walking as Nagano and Honoka walks hand-in-hand, Haruki revealed that she is their daughter

-o-



	Break into 3 : She returns home
Ketsu | Winter | ketsu (結)': conclusion, though 結 can also mean result, consequence, outcome, effect, coming to fruition, bearing fruit, etc. 

Haruki finally opened the portal

She must bid her farewell to both of her younger parents

 She is at the forest again, silent. The trees behind her is just a circular shaped tree, she opened her phone. There are receptions, she is back. She looked up at the sky, it’s morning.
	
	Finale : She confronted her father, this time, more confidently. Declaring that she wanted to persue Art School, this time, she convinced him empathetically rather than aggresively, that she can, in fact. Make it in Art school. Her father relented, finally agreeing.

	Return with the Elixir : She gave him an artefact she got back when she was back in time, he looked at it. Seeing that he had something similar

            <Title>Chapter 15 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Matsuda sighed, her hands on her hips as she surveyed the cottage. “Gosh, Haruki, you are a mess! What have you done to my cottage?” she complained, gesturing to the scratches and dents on the back door. “Did you try to pry it open on the inside too?”
Haruki winced, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. “I-I’m sorry! I just wanted to go back, you know? I never would’ve thought this was yours.”
“It is mine!” Matsuda said, her tone indignant as she moved to the small stove in the corner of the room. She filled a kettle with water and set it to boil, her movements brisk but precise. “Didn’t you see the names anywhere?”
Haruki hesitated, her brow furrowing as she tried to recall. “It says… Matsuko,” she said slowly.
“Yeah…” Matsuda replied, her voice softening as she turned to face Haruki. “That’s my new name.”
Haruki blinked, confusion written all over her face. “Your… new name?”
Matsuda—or Matsuko, as she now called herself—pulled out two teacups and placed them on the small wooden table. She didn’t answer right away, instead focusing on preparing the tea. The kettle began to whistle, and she poured the steaming water into a teapot, the scent of chamomile filling the air.
Finally, she placed a steaming cup of tea in front of Haruki and sat down across from her, cradling her own cup in her hands. “It’s… a long story, Haruki,” she said, her tone more serious now.
Haruki stared at her, her mind racing with questions. “But… why? Why change your name? And why are you here? How long have you been here?”
Matsuda took a slow sip of her tea, her expression thoughtful. “One question at a time, Haruki-chan. You’re going to give me a headache.”
Haruki flushed again, realizing she had been firing off questions like a machine gun. “Sorry,” she muttered, wrapping her hands around the warm teacup.
Matsuda chuckled, the sound warm and familiar. “It’s okay. I get it. You’re confused, scared, and probably a little overwhelmed. Trust me, I’ve been there.”
Haruki looked up at her, her eyes wide. “You have?”
“Of course,” Matsuda said, leaning back in her chair. “Do you think I just woke up one day and decided to live in a creepy old cottage in the middle of nowhere?”
Haruki couldn’t help but laugh, the sound surprising even herself. “I guess not.”
She hesitated for a moment, then asked the question that had been burning in her mind since Matsuda revealed her identity. “Matsuda-senpai… how did you end up here?”
Matsuda paused, her fingers tightening around her teacup. She looked at Haruki, her expression thoughtful, as if deciding how much to share. Finally, she set the cup down and leaned back in her chair.
“Do you remember my graduation?” Matsuda asked, her voice soft. “When I gathered the Arts Club members for that farewell party in the club room?”
Haruki nodded, the memory coming back to her in vivid detail. She remembered how Matsuda had been the heart of the club, her passion for art inspiring everyone around her. She remembered the laughter, the music, the way Matsuda’s eyes had lit up when she announced her acceptance to Tokyo University’s Fine Arts program. It had been a moment of pure joy, a celebration of all they had accomplished together.
“I remember,” Haruki said, a small smile tugging at her lips. “You were so excited. We all were.”
Matsuda’s smile was bittersweet. “Yeah. I was excited. But… I never got to go.”
Haruki’s smile faded, replaced by a look of confusion. “What do you mean? You were accepted, weren’t you?”
“I was,” Matsuda said, her voice tinged with regret. “But my parents… they didn’t approve. They said it was too expensive, that life in Tokyo would be too hard. They told me the job prospects were unstable, that I’d be throwing my future away.” She sighed, her gaze dropping to the table. 
Haruki’s chest tightened. It did sound familiar—painfully so. It was the same argument she had had with her parents, the same fears and doubts thrown back at her. The realization hit her like a punch to the gut. Matsuda had been through the same thing. She had faced the same struggles, the same heartbreak.
“What… what did you do?” Haruki asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Matsuda’s expression darkened, and for a moment, she didn’t answer. Then, slowly, she began to speak. 
“I ran away. I couldn’t take it anymore—the arguments, the pressure, the feeling that no one believed in me. So I left. I didn’t know where I was going, but I ended up at an abandoned house. I thought I’d just stay there for the night, figure things out in the morning. But when I woke up… everything had changed.”
Haruki’s breath caught in her throat. “You… you traveled back in time?”
Matsuda nodded, her eyes distant. “Yeah. Just like you.”
She took a sip of her tea, her expression thoughtful. “I also went to school here,” she continued, her voice calm but tinged with curiosity. “And I met my own parents—the younger versions of the Matsudas. It was… strange, to say the least.”
Haruki’s eyes widened. “You did? What were they like?”
Matsuda chuckled softly. “Young. Naive. Completely unaware of who I was, of course. But that’s not the weirdest part.” She set her teacup down and leaned forward, her gaze intense. “When I checked the school records, I found something that didn’t make sense. There was a record of Yaeko Matsuda—my name—from 1960. As if I had always been here.”
Haruki’s breath caught in her throat. “That… that’s impossible. You shouldn’t even have been born yet.”
“Exactly,” Matsuda said, her voice low. “And I’m guessing you’ve noticed something similar, haven’t you?”
Haruki nodded slowly, her mind racing. She had seen her own name in the school records too, listed as a student. At the time, she had brushed it off as a strange coincidence, but now… now it felt like something more. Something deliberate.
“What does it mean?” Haruki asked, her voice trembling. “Why are our names here? Why are we here?”
Matsuda leaned back in her chair, her expression serious. “I’ve spent a lot of time reading the books and journals in this cabin, trying to figure that out. And I’ve come to one conclusion.” She paused, her eyes locking onto Haruki’s. 
“You have to get your parents together before the end of summer. Otherwise, the door will close forever.”
Haruki’s heart skipped a beat. The words hit her like a thunderclap, sending a jolt of realization through her. Of course. It made sense now—why she had been brought here, why she had met the younger versions of her parents. This wasn’t just about understanding them or reconciling with the past. This was about changing it.
“If they don’t get together,” Haruki said slowly, her voice barely above a whisper, “then… I won’t exist. Is that what you’re saying?”
Matsuda nodded, her expression grim. “Exactly. And if the door closes before you can make it happen, you’ll be stuck here. Just like me.”
Haruki’s chest tightened at the words. “What do you mean, ‘just like you’?” she asked, her voice trembling. “Are you… stuck here forever?”
Matsuda sighed, her gaze drifting to the window. The moonlight streamed in, casting a soft glow over her face. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “I’ve been here for two years now. I arrived when you were still a first-year remember?”
Haruki’s eyes widened. “Two years? But… how? What happened?”
Matsuda leaned back in her chair, her expression distant. “Back then, I had the same chance you do now. I was supposed to make sure my parents met and fell in love before the end of summer. But… I failed. Summer passed, and they never got together. And in this timeline, there will never be a ‘Yaeko Matsuda’ because I was never born.”
Haruki’s breath caught in her throat. The weight of Matsuda’s words settled over her like a heavy blanket. “So… you’re just… gone? In the future?”
Matsuda nodded, her smile bittersweet. “Yeah. Poof. Like I never existed.” She paused, then added, “But life goes on, you know? I graduated here, in this time. I found work as a painter—advertisements, magazines, even galleries sometimes. It’s not the life I imagined, but… it’s mine.”
Haruki stared at her, her mind racing. She couldn’t imagine what it must be like to lose everything—your family, your friends, your entire existence—and still find a way to move forward. “Do you… do you miss it?” she asked softly. “The present, I mean.”
Matsuda was silent for a long moment, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. Finally, she spoke, her voice calm but tinged with sadness. “I used to. Every day. But… I’ve let it go. I’m a new person now. A painter. It’s what I’ve always wanted, even if it’s not how I thought it would happen.”
She looked up at Haruki, her eyes steady. “And if I ever want to see my time again, I just have to wait fifty years. It’s not so bad, really. I’ve made a life here. A good one.”
Haruki’s chest ached at the words. She wanted to say something—to tell Matsuda how brave she was, how strong—but the words stuck in her throat. Instead, she reached out and placed a hand on Matsuda’s arm, her touch gentle but firm.
“You’re amazing, Matsuda-senpai,” she said, her voice trembling. “I don’t know if I could do what you’ve done.”
Matsuda smiled, her eyes softening. “You’re stronger than you think, Haruki-chan. And you still have a chance. Don’t waste it.”
Haruki nodded, her resolve hardening. She wouldn’t let Matsuda’s fate become her own. She would do whatever it took to make sure her parents got together, to make sure she had a future to return to.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 23 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The narrow hallway behind the shelter smelled of old mop water and sun-warmed wood, its shadows stretching long across the chipped linoleum. Honoka stood rigid as a bamboo stalk, her back nearly touching the janitor's closet door as if it might swallow her whole. Across from her, Nagano leaned against the opposite wall with forced casualness, his fingers drumming a nervous rhythm against the soda bottle she'd given him. From the outside, he looked perfectly at ease - but the way his Adam's apple kept bobbing betrayed his unease.
Twenty meters away, pressed against the hallway's corner, a pile of baseball players formed a sweaty human pyramid trying to eavesdrop. Haruki elbowed her way between two particularly large outfielders, earning a few grumbles before she made her way to prime viewing position.
&quot;So,&quot; Nagano broke the silence, twisting the soda cap with a sharp hiss of carbonation. &quot;You like this brand too?&quot;
Honoka shook her head so fast her glasses slipped. She pushed them up with one trembling finger. &quot;I-it's for you,&quot; she stammered, thrusting the bottle forward again as if he might have forgotten holding it. &quot;I heard you liked it.&quot;
&quot;Oh! Thanks!&quot; Nagano's grin flashed too bright, too quick. &quot;How considerate of you.&quot; He took an exaggerated swig, the bottle's condensation dripping onto his already sweat-damp shirt. &quot;So... what did you want to talk about?&quot;
The silence that followed was so thick even the eavesdroppers held their breath. Haruki could see Honoka's fingers worrying the hem of her skirt, the way her throat worked around unspoken words. The baseball players exchanged betting glances - this had all the hallmarks of a legendary confession scene.
&quot;I've heard you wanted to make music for the end of summer festival...&quot; Honoka finally managed.
From behind the wall, a ripple of murmurs spread through the baseball team like wildfire.
&quot;Ooooh, she's asking him to the festival!&quot; whispered the pitcher, nudging the catcher.
&quot;Dude, she's totally confessing!&quot; someone hissed.
&quot;Will you morons shut up?&quot; Haruki snarled through clenched teeth, delivering a sharp elbow to the shortstop's ribs for emphasis. The group collectively winced but fell silent.
Nagano blinked. How the hell did she know about the festival music? He hadn’t told anyone except the band guys, and they weren’t exactly gossipy types. His fingers tightened around the soda bottle, condensation slick against his palm. Then it hit him—the way Honoka’s gaze kept darting toward the hallway corner where Haruki was (badly) hiding with a bunch of his inconspicuous baseball team.
&quot;Yeah, I do.&quot; His eyes narrowed playfully. A slow grin spread across his face. Of course. Haruki had a hand in this. That girl was like a typhoon—impossible to ignore, leaving chaos and half-baked schemes in her wake, &quot;Did Haruki tell you that?&quot;
Honoka's nervous giggle fluttered like paper in wind, and this time, her voice didn’t shake. It danced—just a little. She pushed her glasses up, not to hide, but to see him better, &quot;Yeah, she did.&quot; 
&quot;Hey! Don't bring me into this--&quot; Haruki's protest was immediately shushed by a grimy hands clapping over her mouth from various baseball players.
“Will you shut up?” hissed one of the baseball player.
The tension cranked tighter as Honoka took a shuddering breath. Haruki could practically see the words stuck in her throat, the way her lips shaped silent rehearsals. The baseball team leaned forward in unison, their cleats scraping against the floor.
&quot;You know... I...&quot; Honoka began, her voice barely above a whisper.
In the hush that followed, a single bead of sweat rolled down the pitcher's nose and splattered on the tiles. The cleanup batter mouthed she's gonna confess to the shortstop. Haruki dug her nails into her palms, torn between wanting to throttle Honoka for taking so long and strangling the baseball team for their commentary.
From her vantage point, she could see Nagano’s grip tightening around the soda bottle—his knuckles whitening even as his smile stayed perfectly, painfully relaxed. The boy was a master of pretending he wasn’t freaking out.
Then—
&quot;I, as a member of the Literature Club, can provide you help with the lyrics!&quot; Honoka blurted.
A beat of absolute silence. Even the flickering hallway lights seemed to pause.
Haruki’s cheer was immediately drowned out by the baseball team’s collective groan—a sound like a deflating parade balloon. The pitcher ripped off his cap and hurled it to the ground, where it spun in a pathetic circle before settling at Honoka’s feet.
&quot;That’s it?!&quot; he groaned, disbelieved. Voice cracking. &quot;We risked Coach’s wrath for THIS? No confession? No—&quot; He clutched his chest, &quot;—clutching each other as the sunset paints them gold?!&quot;
The shortstop collapsed to his knees, pressing his glove to his forehead like a Victorian heroine. &quot;The greatest romantic tragedy of our time,&quot; he declared, as the cleanup batter solemnly patted his shoulder.
One by one, the team shuffled away, their cleats dragging mournfully across the linoleum. The third baseman paused just long enough to shoot Nagano a distant look of utter betrayal. &quot;I believed in you, Fujiyama.&quot;
Then they were gone, leaving behind only the faint scent of sweat, sunflower seeds, and shattered dreams.
Haruki stood alone in the sudden quiet, the click-click of the baseball team’s retreat echoing down the hallway. She stared at the abandoned soda cap still lying near Honoka’s shoes.
A few beats of silence stretched between Nagano and Honoka. Then—
&quot;Wait…” Nagano’s eyes widened, “ Are you serious? You will?&quot;  The forced calm shattering into genuine shock.
Honoka nodded, her earlier nervousness melting into something brighter. Her glasses caught the light as she straightened, and for the first time, she looked sure.
&quot;That’s awesome, Aoki-san!&quot; Nagano’s voice cracked mid-cheer. &quot;That’ll be a huge help! Me and my band suck at words—we’ve just been yelling ‘yeah baby!’ over guitar solos!&quot; 
He ran a hand through his hair, grinning like he’d just been handed a winning lottery ticket. &quot;Having the vice president of the Literature Club and head of the poetry division on our side will make us unstoppable!&quot;
Honoka giggled, waving a hand as if to bat away his praise. &quot;It’s nothing, really—&quot;
&quot;Nothing?&quot; Nagano scoffed. &quot;You’re the one who wrote ‘The River in Winter’ for the school’s weekly paper, right? That thing made our drummer cry like a baby.&quot;
Honoka’s cheeks went pink. &quot;That… might’ve been an accident, it was just for the weeky papers afterall.&quot;
&quot;A good accident if you could call it that!&quot; Nagano chuckled, and for a second, his usual swagger flickered into something quieter. Sincere.
Nagano’s shoes scuffed against the linoleum as he leaned against the lockers, his motorcycle keys jingling in his pocket. Then he paused.
&quot;That’s a fancy book,&quot; he said, nodding at the thick novel wedged under Honoka’s arm. A silk tassel dangled from its pages, the kind used in old libraries.
Honoka stiffened, as if caught smuggling contraband. &quot;O-oh! It’s, um—&quot; She fumbled the book into view, revealing the gold-embossed title: The Makioka Sisters. &quot;One of the texts I’m reviewing for the school magazine’s literature column.&quot;
Nagano plucked the book from her hands before she could protest, flipping it open to a random page. His nose wrinkled at the dense paragraphs. &quot;No pictures? What’s it about—some rich people eating fancy dinners?&quot;
&quot;N-no! Well, yes, there are dinners, but—&quot; Honoka reached for the book, then hesitated when Nagano’s calloused fingers brushed against a marked chapter titled &quot;Taeko’s Rebellion.&quot;
They talked for a while—longer than Haruki expected. Nagano, usually all swagger and half-baked jokes, leaned against the lockers, actually listening as Honoka cradled her worn copy of The Makioka Sisters, its gold-embossed title gleaming under the hallway lights.
&quot;It’s about these four sisters in Osaka before the war,&quot; Honoka explained, fingers tracing the dragonfly on the cover—a creature caught between water and air, just like them. &quot;The youngest wants to marry for love, but the family keeps delaying it, waiting for… for things to be perfect. Like if they wait long enough, the world will stop changing around them.&quot;
Nagano tilted his head. &quot;So it’s a sort of tragedy?&quot;
&quot;No! Well—yes, but—&quot; Honoka pushed her glasses up, her voice gaining momentum. &quot;It’s about how tradition isn’t just rules, you know? It’s this… this thing people cling to when they’re scared. Like the sisters’ obasama, insisting on kimono in a world of sewing machines.&quot;
A pause. Nagano’s soda bottle hovered halfway to his lips.
&quot;You mean,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;They’re not protecting tradition. They’re hiding behind it.&quot;
Honoka’s breath caught. &quot;Yes! Exactly! Like—like how Taeko cuts her hair and opens a shop, even though it shames the family. She chooses the modern world, even if it’s messy.&quot; Her hands fluttered, as if trying to sculpt the idea between them. &quot;I tried explaining this to my club, but they just argued about ‘proper themes’—&quot;
Nagano laughed—not his usual bark, but something warmer, richer. &quot;Sounds like they’re the ones scared of mess.&quot; He flicked the soda cap at her playfully. 
Honoka’s nervous giggle tangled with his laughter, and for a moment, the hallway—with its scuffed floors and the distant echo of janitor’s radio—felt less like a tunnel and more like a sunlit clearing.
Then the bell rang, shrill and inevitable.
Honoka jumped like she’d been shocked. &quot;Oh! I—I have chemistry.&quot; She scrambled to her feet, nearly dropping her book.
&quot;Aoki-san!&quot; Nagano called after her as she retreated down the hall. &quot;What time are you free to talk lyrics?&quot;
She turned, clutching the book to her chest. &quot;After school. The literature club room—third floor.&quot;
A nod. &quot;Got it.&quot;
She took two steps, hesitated, then spun back. &quot;And—!&quot; Her voice hit a squeak. She cleared her throat. &quot;You can just call me Honoka.&quot;
Nagano blinked. Then, with a slow, deliberate smirk: &quot;Alright then, Honoka-san!&quot; He dragged out the honorific like a challenge. &quot;See you after school!&quot;
Honoka’s face flamed. She fled.</Text>
            <Notes>Haruki convinced Honoka that she will be the one who said to him herself that she is willing to help his band with the lyrics, but Honoka was nervous

-o-

&quot;I, as a vice president of the Literature Club, i can provide you help with the lyrics!&quot; Honoka finally said

Haruki cheered, but the rest of the students groaned in dissapointment, Honoka isn't asking him out, she is just helping him out, the students returned to the baseball fields, and Haruki was left alone

There is a few moment of silence from Nagano, &quot;Wait... you're serious, you will?&quot; His eyes widen

Honoka nodded in excitement

&quot;That's awesome, Aoki-san!&quot; Nagano cheered, &quot;That will be a huge help! me and my bands weren't good with words at all! having the vice-president of the Literature club and head of poetry divison will make our music unstoppable!&quot;

Haruki cheered behind the wall, Honoka has succeeded, 

Honoka giggled, humbly downplaying her role as the vice-president of the literature club and head of poetry division, and Nagano saying that she is awesome, being able to write beautiful poetries on the weekly papers constantly,


-o-



They talked for a while, about Nagano's trips. about the books Honoka was reading, about some of the characters in them and how Nagano commented on them, they laughed together



-o-


that is nice, but can you revise the following passage? Can you expand the line &quot;Nagano blinked.&quot; and describe his surprise on how'd Honoka knew of this, before remembering that Honoka is a close friend with Haruki, maybe his expression was confusion at first, then smile afterwards Here is the current passage: Haruki - now fully invested in her role as mission control - whipped around with a glare that could melt steel. &quot;Will you morons shut up?&quot; she snarled through clenched teeth, delivering a sharp elbow to the shortstop's ribs for emphasis. The group collectively winced but fell silent. Nagano blinked. &quot;Yeah, I do.&quot; His eyes narrowed playfully. &quot;Did Haruki tell you that?&quot;

            <Title>Chapter 1 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, humming in the distance.
The screeching of shoes, the rhytmic thudding of basketball being bounced.
The rhythmic scratching of a paintbrush against canvas filled the small room, each stroke deliberate.
The room smelled of acrylics and turpentine, a scent that is associate with freedom for some people.
In the center of the room stood a girl, her figure silhouetted by the golden light of the setting sun streaming through the window. Her short, dark, curly hair hang loosely in a chaotic spiral, stood before an easel, her paintbrush moving almost instinctively across the canvas. 
To us watching, it might have seemed like she was painting a landscape, but to her, it was something more. It was a world where colors meant something, where the lines blurred between reality and imagination. A world where she could be anything.
She stepped back for a moment, tilting her head as she studied her work. The painting was abstract, at the moment. a swirl of green and browns with streaks of gold cutting through like sunlight breaking through a storm. It wasn’t perfect—nothing ever was at the beginning. 
For a fleeting moment, she wondered if such a place could exist. A place where she could just be, without the weight of expectations pressing down on her shoulders.
Her brush hovered over the canvas. Her thoughts drifted. What would it be like to live in a world where her dreams weren’t just dreams? Where she could paint all day, every day, and no one would tell her it was a waste of time? She sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. Maybe such a world only existed in her paintings. Maybe it was foolish to hope for anything more.
Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, the door behind her creaked open. The sound of footsteps anda the faint jingle of a charm bracelet broke the silence.
“Haruki-chan!” 
A sing-songy voice called out, bright and cheerful. 
“There you are!” The girl continued, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”
The girl in front of the easel, Haruki. She didn’t hear her at first. Her mind was still lost in the world of her painting, far removed from the Art Club room.
She was thinking about the shadows—how they should fall, how they should interact with the light. Should the reds be warmer? Did the greens clash? She murmured to herself, her brush hovering uncertainly over the canvas. “Maybe if I add a touch of ochre here…”
The girl, standing by the door with her hands on her hips, frowned when Haruki didn’t respond.
“Haruki-chan!” she called again, louder this time. Still, Haruki didn’t turn.
The boy, standing beside her with arms crossed, let out a quiet sigh. “Aiko, please don’t bother the president,” he warned, already sensing what she was about to do.
Aiko flashed him a grin, ignoring his disapproving tone. “Oh, come on, Akihito. She’s too in her head again.”
Akihito adjusted his glasses, exasperation flickering across his face. “So? Let her concentrate. She had a lot of things in her mind, let her cool off.”
“Or,” Aiko said mischievously, “I could bring her back to reality in the fun way.”
Akihito palmed his face, “Oh, for goodness;s sake.”
Quietly, Aiko tiptoed across the room, her sneakers making no sound on the wooden floor. She crept up behind Haruki, her hands poised to strike.
Then, with a dramatic flourish, she clapped her hands on Haruki’s shoulders and shouted, “Boo!”
Haruki jumped, her paintbrush slipping from her fingers and smearing a streak of green across the canvas.
“Aiko!” she exclaimed, spinning around to glare at her friend. “What was that for?!”
Aiko burst into laughter, doubling over as Haruki scowled. “You should’ve seen your face!” she wheezed, clutching her stomach. 
Akihito let out another sigh and shook his head. “You’re horrible,” he muttered, walking over to inspect the damage. “And now she has to fix that.”
Haruki groaned, turning back to her painting. “Ugh, Aiko! I was almost done with the blocking!”
“Relax, relax! You can totally turn that into, uh…” Aiko squinted at the streak. “A tree branch? A shadow? A really abstract emotion?”
Akihito pinched the bridge of his nose. “Or you know… you could just not ruin her work in the first place, Aiko.”
Haruki sighed, rubbing her temple. “I can’t believe I made you the vice president, what am I thinking.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Aiko said, still giggling. She stepped closer, peering over Haruki’s shoulder at the painting. “Whatcha painting there, Picasso?”
Aiko leaned in, studying the canvas. The painting was still in its rough block-in stage—broad, deliberate strokes of green and brown forming the suggestion of a dense forest. But at the heart of it, partially obscured by shadow and golden shafts of light filtering through the trees, was the outline of a cabin.
It was old, abandoned. Its roof had caved in, leaving jagged beams exposed like broken ribs. The walls, though only loosely defined for now, sagged inward, giving the impression that time had been quietly reclaiming the place. And yet, despite its ruin, there was something strangely tranquil about it. The way the golden light pooled against the decaying wood, the way the colors blended to suggest warmth rather than desolation—it was clear that Haruki wasn’t just painting a ruin. She was painting a feeling.
Aiko whistled under her breath. “Whoa.” She folded her arms and rocked back on her heels. “You’re really going for it with this one.”
Haruki, still focused, nodded. “Komorebi.”
Aiko tilted her head. “Huh?”
“The sunlight filtering through the trees,” Haruki clarified. “I need practice painting light.”
Aiko’s gaze drifted back to the canvas, a crease forming between her brows. “Wait… this looks kinda familiar.” She squinted at the abandoned cabin, its collapsed roof and worn-down walls bathed in golden morning light. “Have I seen this before?”
Haruki smirked, pausing mid-brushstroke. “Seriously? You already forgot?”
Aiko turned to her with a raised brow. “Forgot what?”
Haruki tilted her head toward a nearby easel. Aiko followed her gaze—and there it was. Propped up just in front of Haruki’s workspace was a painting, its colors deep and somber, the same ruined cabin set against the cool purples and burnt oranges of dusk. The brushwork was delicate yet deliberate, every stroke carrying a quiet sorrow.
It hit her then. “Oh—this is from last week! The plein air session.” Aiko snapped her fingers. “When Mrs. Matsuoka came with us.”
Haruki gave a satisfied nod. “Finally. Took you long enough.”
Aiko rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t help smiling as she looked between the two paintings. “So you’re doing a study of hers?”
“Kind of,” Haruki admitted, dipping her brush into a warm ochre tone. “I really liked her piece, but…” she hesitated, eyes flicking toward Mrs. Matsuoka’s painting. “It’s a little too depressing for me.”
Aiko glanced back at both works. Mrs. Matsuoka’s version had a weight to it—an air of longing, as if the cabin were waiting for someone who would never return. Haruki’s, on the other hand, felt entirely different. The golden light filtering through the trees, the way it caught on the edges of the ruin—it gave the scene a quiet hopefulness, like the first breath of morning after a long night.
Aiko crossed her arms. “So instead of sorrow, you went for something warmer?”
Haruki hummed in agreement. “I don’t know… I guess I just wanted to see it in a different light.”
Aiko’s smirk softened. “I like yours better.”
Haruki chuckled. “Mrs. Matsuoka would probably say mine lacks emotional depth.”
Aiko scoffed. “Pfft. No way. It just has a different kind of emotion.” She nudged Haruki’s shoulder. “And personally? I’ll take hopeful over depressing any day.”
Haruki exhaled a small laugh, dipping her brush into the paint again. “Talking about Mrs. Matsuoka…” She kept her eyes on the canvas, carefully dragging a stroke of warm light along the ruined cabin’s edge. “Is she coming today? I thought we were supposed to learn color theory.”
Akihito, who had just entered the room and set his sketchbook down, let out a small hum. “She’s busy with the Career Plan submissions,” he said, stretching his arms over his head. “So, no club for her today.”
Haruki frowned. “Oh, come on. Seriously?”
Akihito gave her a pointed look. “You sound way too disappointed for someone who complains about her long lectures.”
Haruki groaned, flicking excess paint off her brush. “Yeah, yeah. But she actually explains things well. And I wanted to ask her about lighting techniques.”
Akihito smirked as he took a seat. “You’ll survive.”
Then, as if something had just clicked, he turned to Haruki with a knowing look. “Speaking of the Career Plan submissions…” He leaned forward, resting his chin on his hand. “When are you gonna submit yours, Mrs. President?”
Haruki blinked. “Huh?”
Akihito raised a brow. “Your Career Plan papers. It’s due tomorrow, you know? You’ve got to submit it, otherwise, you’ll get in trouble.”
Haruki groaned, throwing her head back dramatically. “Ugh. I’ll do it later.”
“Haruki.” Aiko said, crossing her arms, leveling her with that familiar ‘I’m-about-to-say-something-you-don’t-want-to-hear’ expression.
“You know how much the Art Club means to you,” Aiko said, voice firm. “You’re the president. Matsuda-senpai entrusted you with it. But that doesn’t mean you get to ignore your responsibilities as a student. You can’t keep using the club as an excuse.”
Haruki clicked her tongue, turning back to her canvas. “Geez, Vice President, ease up. You’re starting to sound like Mrs. Matsuoka.”
Aiko narrowed her eyes. “I’m serious.”
Haruki waved a hand dismissively. “I’ll do it at home, alright? It’s not a big deal.”
“Look, Haruki.” Aiko continued, “The deadline is tomorrow—“
She glanced at the clock and gasped. &quot;Oh shoot! We're starting in ten minutes!&quot;
In one fluid motion, she yanked off her heavily stained apron, sending flecks of dried paint scattering as she hung it on its hook. Her movements were hurried but precise - the practiced routine of someone who'd done this hundreds of times before.
Aiko's jaw tightened. Then, with a frustrated huff, she grabbed her bag and shoved the Career Plans paper into Haruki's hands. &quot;Just fill it out and submit it, okay?&quot; she muttered, her usual chaotic energy replaced by rare seriousness. &quot;Before you forget. I’m not reminding you again.&quot;
The tension shattered as the door burst open, flooding the room with a chattering wave of first-years. Backpacks thudded onto tables, water cups clattered at the cleaning station, and the sharp citrusy tang of newly opened acrylic tubes cut through the usual turpentine smell. Like flipping a switch, Aiko's stern expression melted into her trademark grin.
&quot;Alright, little gremlins!&quot; Aiko called, vaulting onto a stool with practiced ease. The silver charms on her bracelet jingled as she spread her arms. &quot;Who's ready to get paint everywhere except the canvas today? Extra points if it ends up in someone's hair!&quot;
Laughter erupted, particularly from a cluster of boys already elbowing each other near the paints. One first-year girl with twin braids immediately clutched her hair protectively, making Aiko laugh.
Haruki exhaled through her nose, putting the Career Plan form between the pages of her sketchbook. As she turned, five eager faces swarmed her so fast she nearly stepped back.
&quot;President Haruki!&quot; A tiny second-year with paint-splattered apron squeezed to the front. &quot;We brought those weird sponges you mentioned last week!&quot; She proudly thrust forward a bag of natural sea sponges, still dripping from being cleaned.
Before Haruki could respond, a lanky boy peered over the girl's shoulder. &quot;Is it figure drawing again? Mrs. Matsuoka said we might get a live model this month!&quot;
&quot;No, I’m afraid we’re not doing figure drawing today, But!&quot; She clapped her hands once, the sound cutting through the chatter. From the supply cart, she grabbed a pre-prepared palette - just cadmium red, ultramarine blue, yellow ochre, and titanium white, “We’re going to do limited color palette!”
Haruki then continued, &quot;Your goal for today is to make me believe a sunset can exist without orange. Or a forest without pure green.&quot; She smirked as groans mixed with excited whispers. &quot;Restrictions breed creativity. Who's up for the challenge?&quot;
Hands shot up like spring saplings. Haruki's chest warmed as she distributed palettes, her earlier avoidance forgotten in the familiar ritual of teaching.
Near the windows, Akihito quietly set up extra easels, though his usual exasperated frown softened when he caught Haruki effortlessly explaining color theory to a struggling first-year. The way she crouched to eye-level with the girl, demonstrating brush techniques on scrap paper - this was the Haruki the club adored.
The room erupted into organized chaos. Brushes clattered in jars, someone dramatically lamented their &quot;muddy abomination&quot; of a mixture, and laughter rang out when Aiko &quot;accidentally&quot; smeared cerulean on her nose. Through it all, Haruki wove between stations, offering tips and the kind of encouragement that made even the shyest members stand taller.
At some point, the late afternoon sun hit the pigment-stained windows just right, casting prismatic light across Haruki's abandoned sketchbook - where the corner of the Career Plan form peeked out, nearly invisible beneath the vibrant life of the art room.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 25 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Days dissolved into weeks like pages torn from a calendar—each one marked by ink-stained fingers, crumpled lyric sheets, and the ever-present scent of Honoka’s chamomile tea steeping in the Editorial Room. The room, once pristine with Honoka’s compulsive order, gradually surrendered to the chaos of creation: guitar picks embedded in the tatami mats, teacups ringed with forgotten stains, and draft after draft of lyrics papering the walls like stubborn autumn leaves refusing to fall.
Haruki watched the evolution with quiet satisfaction. The song had grown roots—Nagano’s rough chords blossoming under Honoka’s meticulous phrasing, Ryo’s drumming finding syncopated rhythm with Jun’s brassy countermelodies. Even the air smelled different now—less like lemon polish and more like possibility, tinged with Nagano’s cologne and Honoka’s lavender-scented erasers.
Then came the afternoon Haruki arrived late, her footsteps muffled by the hallway’s summer hush. Through the editorial room’s half-open door, she saw them: Honoka bent over a notebook, her brow furrowed in that endearing way it did when she wrestled with a stubborn metaphor. Nagano sat closer than usual—no guitar between them today, just a shared dictionary passed back and forth, his calloused finger tracing a word that made Honoka laugh softly.
No bandmates. No audience. Just two people leaning into the same light.
Haruki’s hand froze on the doorknob. A smile curled at the edges of her mouth as she stepped back—not today. Let them have this unobserved moment, this fragile, ordinary magic. She turned on her heel, the wooden floors silent beneath her sneakers.
Outside, the sun hung heavy and golden over the school gates. Haruki tilted her face to its warmth, humming their unfinished melody. Some bridges, she thought, needed to be built without witnesses.
The song had taken on a life of its own now—no longer just ink on piece of notebook paper, but something that pulsed through the walls of Nagano’s makeshift studio. Haruki watched as Honoka, once so hesitant to speak above a whisper, now leaned over Nagano’s shoulder to point at sheet music, her laughter ringing clear as Jun’s trumpet notes. The lyrics they’d agonized over for weeks had become second nature, sung absentmindedly while Ryo tuned his drums or when Nagano tested a new riff, his calloused fingers finding the chords by muscle memory.
What began as lyric-writing sessions had evolved into full-fledged rehearsals. Haruki often found herself perched on an amp, clapping along as they workshopped the bridge for the twentieth time—Nagano scowling at his guitar when a note resisted him. Sometimes Haruki and Honoka became their first test audience, singing along until their voices frayed at the edges. Honoka, who used to mouth poetry silently in library corners, now belted lyrics with her hands cupped around her mouth like a megaphone. 
When they invited the baseball team and Haruki’s classmates for an impromptu gig, the room had buzzed with the kind of energy that made the windows rattle. By the final chorus, even the most skeptical listeners were stomping their feet in time.
But the real transformation happened in the quiet moments after.
At first, it was the usual routine: Haruki and Honoka riding the late tram home, dissecting every chord change and lyric tweak while the city lights blurred past. 
Then one evening, Honoka bit her lip as the tram approached—“Nagano-kun offered to drive me home on his motorcycle.”
Haruki had to physically restrain her grin. “Better hurry then. Your chariot awaits, princess.” She shoved Honoka toward the parking lot where Nagano waited, helmet tucked under his arm.
Soon, it became routine—Honoka climbing onto Nagano’s motorcycle, her arms tentative around his waist at first, then sure as a melody finding its rhythm. Haruki would wave them off, the bike’s growl fading into the city’s hum, and board the tram alone.
Tonight, Haruki stood alone on the tram platform, watching red taillights carve through the city dark—Nagano’s bike weaving toward the riverbank route he’d confessed was his favorite. The breeze carried back Honoka’s laughter, bright as the trumpet’s high notes.
On the evening on the next day, the school bell's shrill cry sent a ripple of motion through the hallway as students spilled from classrooms like marbles from a split bag. Haruki fell into step beside Honoka, their shoulders brushing in the familiar rhythm of after-school departures. But today, Honoka's steps hitched at the stairwell—that tiny, telltale pause.
&quot;I, um—&quot; Honoka adjusted her bookstrap, fingers worrying the frayed edge. &quot;I need to stop by the music room first.&quot;
&quot;Better hurry then,&quot; Haruki grinned, nudging her toward the east wing. &quot;Wouldn't want to keep a certain guitarist waiting.&quot;
Honoka's elbow connected with Haruki's ribs, but her lips quirked upward. &quot;Shut up.&quot;
&quot;Break a leg! Not literally!&quot; Haruki called after her as Honoka disappeared down the corridor, her usual measured pace giving way to something dangerously close to a skip.
Alone now, Haruki meandered toward the shoe lockers, the soles of her loafers scuffing against waxed linoleum. The late afternoon sun slanted through the windows, painting long gold rectangles across the floorboards—like stepping stones leading somewhere new.
&quot;Fujiyama-san!&quot;
Haruki turned to find Sakura trotting to catch up, her bobbed hair bouncing with each step. The late afternoon sun caught the red ribbon in her hair - the same shade as the motorcycle gang's insignia Nagano's crew painted on their jackets.
&quot;You look like you've swallowed a persimmon whole,&quot; Sakura said, falling into step beside Haruki. &quot;Where's your other half? Did Aoki-san finally get tired of you?&quot; She bumped Haruki's shoulder playfully.
Haruki rolled her eyes. &quot;We're not twins, you know.&quot;
Sakura gasped dramatically. &quot;Could've fooled me, you two looked simmilar! Ever since you transferred in, you two have been...&quot; She mimed gluing her hands together.
They passed a group of girls practicing cheerleading routines in the courtyard, their chants punctuated by the rhythmic smack of volleyball practice nearby. The air smelled of freshly cut grass and the faint metallic tang of the bicycle racks.
&quot;Seriously though,&quot; Sakura continued, &quot;Nagano's been skipping our lunch breaks too. Ryo says he's always running off somewhere with sheet music.&quot; She plucked a leaf from a low-hanging maple branch, twirling it between her fingers. &quot;You'd think he was preparing for the end of summer festival with how secretive he's been.&quot;
Haruki bit back a smile. &quot;Maybe he found something more interesting than listening to you complain about math tests.&quot;
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Sakura clutched her chest. &quot;And here I thought we were friends, Fujiyama-san.&quot;
They reached the shoe lockers, where Sakura paused to retie her sneaker. &quot;So?&quot; She peered up at Haruki. &quot;What's the big secret? Did our resident delinquent finally hits off with someone?&quot;
The realization hit like a well-thrown dodgeball. Sakura's fingers froze mid-knot.
&quot;Wait. Nagano's been disappearing. Aoki-san's been absent. And you're walking alone...&quot; She slowly straightened, eyes widening. &quot;No. Way… Are you implying that…&quot;
Haruki's smirk was all the confirmation she needed.
&quot;Finally!&quot; Sakura clapped her hands together, loud enough that a passing teacher frowned. The sound echoed through the hallway like a firecracker. &quot;I thought she'd marry a book before a boy!&quot; She hooked her arm through Haruki's, steering them toward the exit with renewed energy. &quot;Details. Now. How long? Who confessed first? Have they—&quot;
&quot;Don't you have club activities?&quot; Haruki deflected, laughing as Sakura nearly tripped over a stray volleyball.
&quot;Canceled! This is way more important than calligraphy practice!&quot;
As Haruki chattered about rumors and secret admirers, she cast one last glance over her shoulder at the empty hallway. Somewhere beyond those walls, Honoka was probably laughing at one of Nagano's terrible jokes, her cheeks pink with something brighter than embarrassment.
Haruki tucked her hands in her pockets, smiling at the peeling festival poster on the school board. Right on schedule—just faster, messier, better than any plan. Like the song, like summer, like love itself, the pieces had found their own rhythm.</Text>

            <Text>Haruki walked behind Mrs. Azuki, her footsteps echoing softly in the quiet hallway. The teacher’s kind demeanor and gentle guidance reminded her of Mrs. Kitagawa, the teacher who had taken her from the Art Club in the present. The memory was bittersweet, a sharp pang of longing cutting through her chest.
She thought about her weekly plein-air sessions with the Art Club, the way the sunlight would filter through the trees as she painted, the laughter and camaraderie of her fellow club members. She thought about her father, standing at the end of that hallway in the present, his stern expression as he told her it was time to leave the club behind. That had been the last day of her life as she knew it—the day her dreams had been taken from her.
But now, standing in this strange yet familiar version of her school, it felt like a whole new beginning. Everything was the same, yet different. The walls, the floors, the air—it all carried a sense of nostalgia, as if she had stepped into a memory she didn’t know she had.
Mrs. Azuki stopped in front of a door, her hand resting on the handle. Haruki looked up and saw the sign above it: A1. Her heart skipped a beat. This was her classroom—or at least, the 1960s version of it.
“Here we are,” Mrs. Azuki said, her voice warm and reassuring. “This is your classroom, Class 1A. I’ll introduce you to the teacher, and then you can take a seat.”
Mrs. Azuki gently opened the door and peeked inside, interrupting the lesson with a soft knock. The teacher—a tall, stern-looking man with glasses perched on the bridge of his nose—paused mid-sentence and turned to the door. Mrs. Azuki whispered something to him, gesturing toward Haruki. The teacher nodded, his expression serious but not unkind.
He turned back to the class, his voice firm and commanding. “Class, we will be joined by a new student today. Please welcome her properly.”
Mrs. Azuki stepped aside and motioned for Haruki to enter. Haruki took a deep breath, straightened her uniform, and stepped into the classroom. All eyes turned to her, the students sitting upright in their seats, their hands neatly folded on their desks. The atmosphere was formal, almost rigid, a stark contrast to the more relaxed environment she was used to in the present.
The teacher gestured for Haruki to stand at the front of the class. “Introduce yourself,” he said, his tone leaving no room for hesitation.
Haruki swallowed hard, her voice trembling slightly as she spoke. “My name is Haruki Fujiyama. I’m… pleased to meet you all.”
The class responded in unison, their voices loud and clear. “Welcome, Haruki-san!”
The teacher nodded, seemingly satisfied with the introduction. He pointed to an empty seat near the back of the room. “You may take your seat there, Fujiyama.”
Haruki bowed slightly, a gesture of respect she had seen in old movies but never practiced herself, and made her way to the desk. The students watched her with polite curiosity, their gazes following her as she walked. She sat down, her hands resting on the wooden desk, and glanced around the room.
The classroom was smaller than she remembered, the desks arranged in neat, orderly rows. The walls were lined with wooden panels, and the blackboard at the front was framed by brass trim. The air smelled of chalk and polished wood, a far cry from the faint scent of plastic and metal that permeated her school in the present.
As the teacher resumed the lesson, Haruki’s mind wandered. She thought about Nagano and his friends, about the strict Mr. Genzo, about the strange, surreal world she had found herself in. She didn’t know what the future held, but one thing was clear: she couldn’t go back. Not yet.
For now, all she could do was take it one step at a time.

-o-

The current lesson being taught was chemistry. The teacher stood at the front of the room, writing equations on the blackboard with precise, deliberate strokes. Haruki sat at her desk, her notebook open in front of her, but her mind was elsewhere.
For the first time since arriving in this strange version of her school, she felt a flicker of normalcy. She was a student, sitting in a classroom, listening to a lesson. It was familiar, almost comforting. But as she glanced around the room, a part of her expected to see her best friends, Aiko and Akihito, sitting nearby, ready to pass her a note or share a joke. Instead, she was met with the faces of strangers—students who wouldn’t be born for decades in her own time.
The realization hit her like a punch to the gut. She sighed, leaning forward and resting her chin in her hand. But before she could sink too deeply into her thoughts, the teacher’s sharp voice cut through the air.
“Fujiyama,” he said, his tone firm but not unkind. “Sit properly, please.”
Haruki straightened immediately, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. “Yes, sir,” she murmured, adjusting her posture and folding her hands neatly on her desk. The other students didn’t react, their attention focused on the lesson, but Haruki couldn’t help feeling out of place.
The teacher continued the lesson, his voice steady and authoritative. Haruki tried to focus, but her mind kept wandering. She missed Aiko’s quick wit and Akihito’s quiet support. She missed the Art Club, the freedom to create, the sense of belonging she had found there. But here, in this time, those things didn’t exist—at least, not yet.
When the lesson ended, the teacher announced a class assignment. “You will work in pairs,” he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. “Complete the problems on page 42 and submit your answers by the end of the period.”
The students began pairing up, their movements quick and efficient. Haruki hesitated, unsure of what to do. She didn’t know anyone in the class, and the thought of approaching a stranger made her stomach twist with anxiety.
But then the girl seated next to her—a quiet, serious-looking student with her hair tied back in a neat braid—turned to her and nodded. “You can work with me,” she said, her voice soft but firm.
Haruki blinked, surprised by the offer. “Thank you,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
The girl nodded again, opening her textbook to the assigned page. She didn’t introduce herself at first, simply turning to Haruki and pointing to the problems on the page. “Let’s start with this one,” she said, her tone matter-of-fact.
Haruki pulled her chair closer to the girl’s desk, her heart still racing. She didn’t know what to expect, but for now, she was grateful for the small act of kindness. The girl began explaining the problem, her voice soft but confident. Haruki tried to follow along, but it quickly became clear that she hadn’t fully grasped the lesson.
The girl noticed Haruki’s confusion and paused, her brow furrowing slightly. “You didn’t understand the lesson, did you?” she asked, her tone more curious than accusatory.
Haruki flushed, embarrassed. “Not really,” she admitted, her voice quiet.
The girl smiled, her expression kind. “It’s okay. You can just follow my lead.” She began jotting down the steps to solve the problem, her handwriting neat and precise. Haruki copied her work, her mind still reeling from everything that had happened.
They sat there in silence for a while, the only sound the scratching of their pens on paper. Then, the girl leaned closer and whispered, “Hey.”
Haruki looked up, surprised. “Yeah?”
“You’re Fujiyama, right?” the girl asked, her voice low so as not to disturb the other students.
Haruki nodded. “Yeah.”
“Are you perhaps related to Nagano Fujiyama from 2A?” the girl asked, her tone casual but curious.
Haruki hesitated, her mind racing. How could she explain her connection to Nagano without revealing the truth? Finally, she shook her head. “No,” she said, her voice firm. “We just share the same surname.”
“Oh,” the girl said, a hint of disappointment in her voice. “I’m sure there are a lot of people with the name Fujiyama. Sorry, I jumped to conclusions.” She giggled softly, her cheeks flushing slightly.
Then, as if realizing something, the girl’s eyes widened. “Oh, I’m so sorry! How rude of me—I haven’t even introduced myself!” She reached out her hand, her smile warm and genuine. “I’m Honoka Aoki. Nice to meet you.”
Haruki’s heart skipped a beat. She stared at the girl, her mind struggling to process what she had just heard. “Honoka… Fuji—” she started to say, then corrected herself. “Honoka Aoki?”
The girl nodded, her smile widening. “Yeah. That’s me!”
Haruki’s pen stopped mid-stroke, her hand freezing as realization dawned on her. This girl—this kind, easygoing girl who had been helping her with the assignment—was her mother. Honoka Aoki. The woman who, in the future, would become her strict, traditional mother, always pushing her to conform to societal expectations.
But here, in this time, she was just a teenager. A student. A girl who giggled and apologized for being rude. A girl who didn’t yet know the weight of the future that awaited her.
Haruki’s chest tightened, a mix of emotions swirling inside her—shock, sadness, and a strange, aching tenderness. She didn’t know what to say or how to act. All she could do was stare at Honoka, her mind racing.
Honoka tilted her head, her expression concerned. “Are you okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Haruki forced a smile, though her heart was pounding. “I’m fine,” she said, her voice shaky. “It’s just… nice to meet you mo— I mean, Aoki-san.”
Honoka smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “Nice to meet you too, Fujiyama-san.”
As they returned to their work, Haruki’s mind was a whirlwind of thoughts. She didn’t know how she had ended up here, or why, but one thing was clear: she had been given a chance to see her parents as they truly were—not as the stern, distant figures she knew, but as the people they had been before life had shaped them.
And maybe, just maybe, she could change things. For them. For herself.

Then another teacher was escorting her to one of her class

She introduces herself

Then she sat on one of the desk,

A girl next to her asked, whether she is related to Nagano Fujiyama

Haruki then lied, saying that she isn’t she just share the same surname

The girl then introduced herself to Haruki

She’s Honoka Aoki, she’s the school’s Literature Club writer

            <Text>The dining room was silent, the air thick with tension. The table was bare, no food in sight, just the three of them sitting across from one another. Haruki sat stiffly in her chair, her hands clenched in her lap, her heart pounding in her chest. Her father sat at the head of the table, his expression stern and unreadable. Her mother sat beside him, her face a mixture of concern and frustration. The room felt suffocating, the weight of their expectations pressing down on Haruki like a heavy blanket.
Her father was the first to break the silence. His voice was low and steady, but there was an edge to it that made Haruki’s stomach twist. “Your mother told me about your… desire to go to art school,” he said, his tone carefully controlled.
Haruki’s breath hitched. There was no going back now. Her mother had told him, and the truth was out in the open. She straightened her shoulders, forcing herself to meet his gaze. “Yes,” she said, her voice trembling but firm. “I want to go to art school.”
Her father’s eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward slightly, his hands clasped on the table. “And what?” he said, his voice sharp. “Starve on the street as you play with your paint?”
Haruki flinched but didn’t look away. “No,” she said, her voice steadying. “I want to make a living as an artist. I want to create something meaningful.”
Her father’s jaw tightened, and he shook his head. “No,” he said firmly. “I won’t allow it. You’ll become a nurse. Because I have no options left for a stable career for you. I offered you the position of chairman in my company—you wouldn’t accept it. I suggested medical school—I have connections so you could get in. You refused. What do you truly want?”
Haruki’s chest tightened, but she held her ground. She had known this moment would come, and she had prepared herself for it. “Art school,” she said, her voice clear and resolute. “I want to be an artist.”
The room fell silent again, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Her parents exchanged a glance, their expressions unreadable. For a moment, Haruki thought she saw something flicker in her father’s eyes—disappointment, frustration, maybe even a hint of sadness. But it was gone as quickly as it appeared.
The room fell silent again, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Her parents exchanged a glance, their expressions unreadable. For a moment, Haruki thought she saw something flicker in her father’s eyes—disappointment, frustration, maybe even a hint of sadness. But it was gone as quickly as it appeared.
Her father took off his glasses and set them on the table, his movements slow and deliberate. He leaned forward slightly, his gaze locking onto Haruki’s. “I’ve heard about your senior… Yaeko Matsuda,” he said, his voice low and measured. “The Parent’s Board has been told of her story.”
Haruki’s breath caught in her throat. “Please don’t bring her into this, Father,” she said, her voice trembling.
Her father’s expression didn’t change. “I know you looked up to her a lot,” he continued, his tone softening slightly. “But our situation and hers are different. She was the youngest child in her family, with two working older sisters. She could pursue art all she wanted because her older sisters could provide for her if she failed.” He paused, his gaze intensifying. “But you, Haruki, your situation is different. You are our only child. We can’t allow you to fail. You cannot fail, because who will support you? Who will look after you when we’re gone? Who will feed you if your art fails? I can’t afford for you to fail, Haruki.”
Haruki’s chest tightened, but she forced herself to speak. “I can support myself,” she said, her voice shaking but defiant. “I know a place. I know some connections. I can make it work—”
Before she could finish, her father slammed his hand on the table, the sound echoing through the room like a gunshot. Haruki flinched, her words dying in her throat. Her father’s voice rose, sharp and filled with anger. “Yaeko Matsuda killed herself, Haruki! Do you think I will allow you to follow in her footsteps?!”
Her mother gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “Nagano…” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
Haruki froze, her heart pounding in her chest. She had been looking down at her hands, but now she slowly raised her head, her eyes meeting her father’s. His face was flushed, his jaw clenched, but beneath the anger, she saw something else—fear. Raw, unbridled fear.
The room was silent, the weight of his words pressing down on her like a physical force. Haruki’s mind raced, trying to process what he had just said. Yaeko Matsuda… killed herself? No, that couldn’t be true. She had just disappeared. That’s what everyone said. That’s what she had believed.
But the look in her father’s eyes told her otherwise.
Haruki’s voice was barely a whisper when she finally spoke. “What… what do you mean?”
Her father’s shoulders slumped, the anger draining out of him as quickly as it had come. He ran a hand over his face, suddenly looking much older than he had a moment ago. “Yaeko Matsuda… she didn’t just disappear, Haruki. She… she took her own life. Her family tried to keep it quiet, but the truth came out eventually. She couldn’t handle the pressure. She couldn’t make it as an artist, and she couldn’t face the failure.”
Haruki’s vision blurred, her chest tightening as if a vice had been clamped around her heart. She shook her head, trying to deny it, but the words wouldn’t come. Yaeko Matsuda, the talented artist she had admired, the one who had inspired her to keep pursuing her dreams… gone. Just like that.
Her father’s voice cut through the silence, firm and unyielding. “I’ve signed you up for a prep school,” he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. “It’s a program to prepare you for nursing school. It’s a stable job, and it’s what your mother recommends. You’ll start next week.”
Haruki’s breath hitched, her hands gripping the edge of the table as if it were the only thing keeping her upright. Her father continued, his words sharp and final. “And you’ll quit the Art Club. You need to focus on your future, Haruki. No more distractions.”
The room seemed to close in around her, the walls pressing closer with every word. Haruki sat silent, her body rigid, her mind reeling. She felt like everything had left her—her breath, her voice, her strength. She was still, as still as a rock, her eyes fixed on the table in front of her.
Her father’s words echoed in her mind, each one a hammer blow. Prep school. Nursing. Quit the Art Club. The truth about Yaeko Matsuda’s disappearance—no, her death—was still sinking in, a heavy, suffocating weight on her chest. And now this. It was too much. It was all too much.
She felt like she was drowning, the waves of her father’s expectations and her mother’s quiet resignation pulling her under. She had to sacrifice everything—her dreams, her passion, the one thing that made her feel alive. For what? Stability? Security? A life that wasn’t hers?
Her father’s voice broke through her thoughts, softer now but no less firm. “Haruki, this is for your own good. You’ll understand one day.”
Haruki didn’t respond. She couldn’t. Her throat was too tight, her chest too heavy. She stared at the table, her hands trembling in her lap. The room was silent, the air thick with tension, but all she could hear was the pounding of her own heart.
Her mother reached out, placing a hand on her arm. “Haruki…” she said softly, her voice filled with concern. But Haruki didn’t look up. She couldn’t.
Then, suddenly, Haruki stood up. The chair screeched against the floor as she pushed it back, her hands trembling but her body rigid with defiance. Her parents stared at her, startled by the sudden movement. For a moment, the room was silent, the air thick with tension.
And then Haruki exploded.
“I’ve followed everything you wanted!” she shouted, her voice shaking with anger and years of pent-up frustration. “Everything! Back in middle school, I studied late every night. I gave up playing with my friends, I gave up everything just to get into this competitive high school. And for what? To be miserable? To feel like I didn’t matter?”
Her father opened his mouth to speak, but Haruki didn’t let him. She was done listening. “I was miserable,” she continued, her voice rising. “Every single day, I was miserable. Until my first year of high school, when Matsuda-senpai saw my drawing. She asked me to join the Art Club. She taught me how to paint. She believed in me. And for the first time in my life, I felt like I mattered. Like I belonged somewhere. People liked my paintings. People found meaning in my art. And it was all because of her. Because she believed in me!”
Her chest heaved as she spoke, her words pouring out like a flood she could no longer contain. “And now you’re telling me to quit? To give up the one thing that makes me happy? The one thing that makes me feel alive? No. I won’t do it. I can’t do it.”
Her father’s face was a mask of shock, but Haruki wasn’t finished. She turned to him, her eyes blazing. “Maybe Matsuda wouldn’t have done what she did if her parents had believed in her! Did you ever think about that? Did you ever think that maybe she just needed someone to tell her it was okay to dream? That it was okay to fail?”
The room fell silent, her words hanging in the air like a thunderclap. Her mother’s hand was pressed to her mouth, her eyes wide with shock. Her father sat frozen, his expression unreadable.
Haruki didn’t wait for a response. She turned and stormed out of the dining room, knocking the chair she had been sitting on to the floor with a loud clatter. Her mother called after her, “Haruki! Wait!” but she was already gone, her footsteps echoing down the hallway.
She flung open the front door and ran outside, the cool night air hitting her face like a slap. She didn’t know where she was going, but she didn’t care. All she knew was that she couldn’t stay there. Not in that house. Not with those expectations. Not with that suffocating weight pressing down on her chest.
Her feet carried her down the street, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The tears streamed down her face, but she didn’t stop. She ran until her legs burned and her lungs ached, until the house was far behind her and the world around her was quiet and still.

            <Text>This is such a heartwarming and creative way to bring Nagano and Honoka together! By combining their talents—Nagano’s music and Honoka’s writing—Haruhi not only helps them connect but also gives them a chance to fulfill their dreams, even if just for a moment. This collaboration becomes a beautiful metaphor for their relationship: two seemingly opposite people coming together to create something meaningful. Let’s brainstorm how this idea can unfold and how Haruhi can orchestrate their collaboration.

How Haruhi Brings Nagano and Honoka Together
The Idea:
Haruhi realizes that Nagano and Honoka are perfect for each other but are too insecure to make the first move. She comes up with the idea of them collaborating on a song for the school festival.
She pitches the idea to Nagano first, knowing his desire to perform, and then to Honoka, appealing to her love of writing.
The Setup:
Haruhi convinces Nagano that he needs a lyricist to make his song truly special. She suggests Honoka, knowing her talent for writing.
She then approaches Honoka, telling her that Nagano needs help writing lyrics for his performance. Honoka is hesitant at first but agrees when Haruhi emphasizes how much this performance means to Nagano.
The Collaboration:
Nagano and Honoka start working together, initially awkward but gradually opening up to each other. Their shared passion for art helps them connect on a deeper level.
Haruhi acts as a mediator, encouraging them to share their thoughts and feelings through their work.
The Performance:
Their collaboration culminates in a heartfelt performance at the school festival, where Nagano sings the song Honoka wrote. This becomes a pivotal moment for both of them, as they realize their feelings for each other.

Key Scenes
Haruhi’s Pitch to Nagano:
Haruhi finds Nagano practicing his guitar and suggests he perform at the festival. When he hesitates, she mentions that he’ll need a lyricist to make his song stand out.
Haruhi’s Pitch to Honoka:
Haruhi approaches Honoka with the idea of writing lyrics for Nagano’s song. Honoka is hesitant but agrees when Haruhi tells her how much this performance means to Nagano.
The First Meeting:
Nagano and Honoka meet to discuss the song. The conversation is awkward at first, but they quickly bond over their shared love of art.
The Writing Process:
Nagano and Honoka spend time together, working on the song. They share stories about their dreams and struggles, growing closer in the process.
The Performance:
Nagano performs the song at the festival, with Honoka watching from the audience. The lyrics reflect their shared experiences and feelings, creating a powerful moment of connection.
The Confession:
After the performance, Nagano and Honoka finally confess their feelings for each other, realizing that they are meant to be together.

Sample Scene: The First Meeting
Here’s a scene where Haruhi brings Nagano and Honoka together for the first time:

Chapter 8: The Collaboration
Haruhi found Nagano in the music room, strumming his guitar with a faraway look in his eyes. She cleared her throat, and he glanced up, surprised to see her.
“Hey,” she said, trying to sound casual. “I was thinking… if you’re going to perform at the festival, you’ll need a really good song, right?”
Nagano shrugged. “I guess. But I’m not exactly a poet.”
“That’s where Honoka comes in,” Haruhi said, grinning. “She’s an amazing writer. I bet she could help you with the lyrics.”
Nagano’s eyes widened. “Honoka Aoki? The class ace? Why would she want to help me?”
“Because she’s nice,” Haruhi said, rolling her eyes. “And because I asked her. She said yes, by the way.”
Nagano looked skeptical but didn’t argue. “Fine. But if she hates my music, don’t blame me.”
Later that day, Haruhi brought Honoka to the music room. Nagano was already there, tuning his guitar. He looked up when they entered, and for a moment, no one spoke.
“Uh, hi,” Nagano said awkwardly.
“Hello,” Honoka replied, equally stiff.
Haruhi clapped her hands, breaking the tension. “Okay, you two! Let’s make some music.”

Sample Scene: The Performance
Here’s a scene where Nagano performs the song Honoka wrote:

Chapter 12: The Festival
The school festival was in full swing, the air filled with laughter and the smell of food. Haruhi stood backstage, watching as Nagano tuned his guitar. He looked nervous, his fingers trembling slightly.
“You’ve got this,” she said, giving him an encouraging smile.
He nodded, taking a deep breath. “Thanks. For everything.”
On stage, the emcee announced Nagano’s performance. The crowd cheered as he walked out, his guitar slung over his shoulder. Haruhi spotted Honoka in the audience, her eyes fixed on Nagano.
The first notes of the song rang out, soft and haunting. Then Nagano began to sing, his voice filled with emotion. The lyrics Honoka had written told a story of dreams, longing, and the courage to reach for the stars.
As the song ended, the crowd erupted into applause. Nagano looked out at the audience, his eyes finding Honoka’s. For a moment, it was just the two of them, connected by the music and the words they had created together.

            <Title>Chapter 24 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, somewhere across the school yard, practicing.
The distant screeching of shoes, the rhytmic thudding of basketball being bounced at the gymnasium below.
The rhythmic thudding of books being moved, the crunching of pages being flipped. filled the small room, each scratch deliberate, each movement lost in the rhythm of cleanliness. 
The Editing Room of the Literature Club smelled of lemon polish and old paper—a scent Honoka usually found comforting. Today, it reeked of desperation.
Haruki kicked her feet up on a freshly dusted desk, watching as Honoka adjusted the repaired lamp for the fifth time. The room already gleamed: floors mopped to a dangerous shine, stacks of manuscripts squared like military formations, even the wilting azalea on the windowsill had been resuscitated with aggressive watering.
“Honoka-chan, you do realize,” Haruki said, spinning a broom between her palms, “People usually just sit on their first date. They don’t deep-clean like they’re hiding a crime scene from a Murakami novel.”
Honoka’s polishing rag froze mid-swipe. “It’s not a date! It’s a collaboration! Who is Murakami anyway, you’re making it up!”
“Mhm.” Haruki leaned in, grinning. “Which is why you made me scrub the ceiling fan. And why you squeaked when he called you ‘Honoka-san’—”
“I did not squeak!” Honoka’s voice did, in fact, squeak.
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Haruki twirled a finger around her ear. &quot;‘Call me Honoka~’ So bold! So romantic!—&quot;
&quot;Haruki!&quot; A blotch of red spread from Honoka’s neck to her hairline. She nearly upended the inkwell in her fluster. &quot;It’s just polite! And once again I told you, this isn’t a date!&quot;
Haruki collapsed into giggles. Outside, the cicadas’ drone swelled—nature’s own laugh track.
“Besides,” Haruki continued, poking Honoka’s shoulder, “Who brings up The Makioka Sisters as small talk? ‘Oh yes, Nagano-san, let me romance you with metaphors about economic decline in pre-war Osaka—’”
Honoka hurled a pillow at her. “Stop twisting it! You know I didn’t mean—”
A knock at the door.
Both girls froze mid-motion - Honoka with her polishing rag suspended above an already gleaming desk, Haruki with her teasing grin still locked in place. The cicadas outside seemed to hush in anticipation.
&quot;Uh...hello?&quot; Nagano's muffled voice came through the wood. &quot;Is this the Editorial Room?&quot;
Honoka made a sound like a deflating balloon - something between a gasp and a squeak. Her hands flew to her hair, patting down imaginary flyaways, then to her skirt to smooth nonexistent wrinkles.
Haruki watched with gleeful horror as Honoka's entire body seemed to short-circuit. The usually composed Literature Club vice president was now doing a bizarre little dance of panic - one foot stepping toward the door, then retreating, hands fluttering like startled birds.
&quot;Y-yes! Just a second!&quot; Her voice cracked
The doorknob turned. Haruki could hear the rusty hinges whining in protest, each creak stretching the moment taut with anticipation. She caught a glimpse of Honoka's face - eyes wide behind her glasses, lips pressed into a thin line, the flush on her cheeks spreading down her neck like spilled ink.
Just before the door opened fully, Honoka seemed to remember her role as host. She lunged forward in a jerky motion, yanking the door the rest of the way open with enough force to make it bang against the wall.
&quot;Welcome!&quot; she announced, voice an octave too high. The cheerful tone clashed spectacularly with her deer-in-headlights expression.
&quot;Hey, sorry we’re late—&quot; Nagano shouldered his way in, guitar case bumping the doorframe with a thunk. Behind him, two band members gaped at the suspiciously sparkling room like they’d walked into a shrine instead of a literature club.
Nagano jerked a thumb at the duo. &quot;This is Ryo—&quot; The drummer, a lanky boy with drumstick calluses peeking from his pocket, gave a peace sign. &quot;—and Jun.&quot; The trumpeter, whose hair defied gravity in a way that suggested either genius or sleep deprivation, nodded solemnly.
Haruki blinked. A drummer and a trumpet player? 
Honoka bowed, snapping Haruki back to reality. &quot;Aoki Honoka, vice president. Thank you for coming.&quot;
Haruki copied the bow, then smirked. &quot;And I’m Fujiyama Haruki, I’m just tagging along.&quot;
Honoka elbowed her ribs before gesturing to the desks. &quot;Please, make yourselves comfortable.&quot;
Ryo immediately collapsed into a chair, spinning a drumstick across his knuckles. &quot;Whoa. This place smells like my grandma’s house.&quot;
&quot;That’s the polish,&quot; Jun muttered, eyeing the gleaming shelves. &quot;And possibly regret*.&quot;*
Nagano set his guitar case down with a grin. &quot;Ignore them. They’re allergic to cleanliness.&quot;
Haruki leaned into Honoka’s space, stage-whispering: &quot;You sure you don’t want me to leave? I could vanish*. Poof.&quot;* She wiggled her fingers. &quot;Give you four some privacy—&quot;*
Honoka snatched her collar, yanking her back. &quot;You’re staying,&quot;* she hissed, cheeks flaming.

-o-

The borrowed low table wobbled precariously as they settled onto cushions that Honoka had fluffed into near-spherical perfection. Steam curled from the teapot in delicate tendrils - chamomile with a hint of citrus, Haruki noted with private amusement. Some things never change. The mother who always served tea to her daughter's school friends had clearly been doing this since her own teenage years.
Nagano slapped three crumpled notebook pages onto the table. &quot;Alright, geniuses. Behold - our masterpiece.&quot;
Ryo and Jun leaned forward with the solemn pride of artists unveiling a gallery piece. Haruki smoothed out the first sheet and immediately choked on her tea.
&quot;Racing through the night like a shooting star,
My heart burns for you no matter where you are—&quot;
&quot;Are these... love lyrics?&quot; Haruki wheezed, wiping tea droplets from the page.
&quot;Youth lyrics,&quot; Nagano corrected, crossing his arms. &quot;It's metaphorical.&quot;
Honoka carefully took the second page, her eyebrows performing a slow ascent toward her hairline as she read:
&quot;Your smile shines brighter than chrome,
Together we'll never feel alone—&quot;
Jun nodded sagely. &quot;That one's my favorite stanza.&quot;
Haruki opened her mouth, but Honoka's elbow found her ribs with practiced precision. The literature club vice president adjusted her glasses, the very picture of academic composure. &quot;The... emotional intent comes through strongly,&quot; she began diplomatically. &quot;And your use of vehicular imagery as a metaphor for freedom is... inventive.&quot;
Nagano's eyes lit up. &quot;Right? The bike represents—&quot;
&quot;But,&quot; Honoka continued gently, &quot;Perhaps the execution could benefit from more... subtlety?&quot; She pointed to a line. &quot;When you rhyme 'fire' with 'desire' three times in one verse, it loses some... nuance.&quot;
Haruki could no longer contain herself. &quot;It's horrible,&quot; she declared. &quot;This reads like a love letter written by a traffic light! 'My heart burns for you' - are you a shooting star or a grease fire?&quot;
Ryo gasped in mock offense. &quot;You wound me, Fujiyama-san!&quot;
Nagano snatched the papers back, but he was grinning. &quot;Alright, critic. Let's hear your genius lyrics.&quot;
Honoka hid a smile behind her teacup. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said softly, &quot;we could try writing something together?&quot;
The room stilled. Nagano's fingers tapped against his knee - not nervous, but anticipatory. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Show us how it's done, Aoki Honoka-san.&quot;
The way he emphasized her name made Honoka's teacup rattle in its saucer. Haruki smirked. Game on
And so, as the fading afternoon light bled gold through the paper blinds as they worked, turning the editorial room into a lantern of murmured ideas and crumpled drafts. Pencil smudges decorated Honoka's fingertips like inkblots, while Nagano's guitar pick had worn a groove into the table's edge from restless tapping. What began as stilted suggestions blossomed into something alive - Honoka's careful metaphors weaving through Nagano's raw energy, Haruki's blunt revisions sanding down the roughest edges.
By the time the school bells chimed sunset, the second draft lay before them - transformed from its clunky beginnings into something that made Ryo drum his fingers against his knees and Jun hum under his breath.
&quot;Alright,&quot; Nagano said, fingers already finding chords on his guitar. &quot;Let's hear this monster.&quot;
Honoka's hands fluttered. &quot;W-wait! The third stanza's meter is still—&quot;
But Jun's trumpet was already at his lips, releasing a bright, brassy note that startled a laugh from Haruki. Nagano grinned and began to play, the melody rough but earnest, like sunlight through tree leaves.
And then he sang.
Honoka's protests died in her throat. Nagano's voice wasn't polished - it cracked on the high notes, his tempo occasionally stumbling - but it was warm, thrumming with the same energy as when he talked about music. Without realizing, she found herself tapping along to the rhythm, her earlier anxiety melting like spring snow.
Haruki, ever fearless, was the first to join in, harmonizing off-key but with gusto. When Honoka finally added her voice - softly at first, then stronger - their mismatched choir filled the small room. The lyrics they'd agonized over now took flight, carried by three voices that had no business sounding good together, yet somehow did.
Outside, the cicadas provided percussion. Inside, for these fleeting moments, there was only music and shared breath and the impossible rightness of creation. Even the musty editorial room seemed to hold its breath, the stacked manuscripts and Honoka's carefully arranged pencils bearing witness to this fragile, perfect thing they'd made together.
As the last note faded, Nagano's eyes met Honoka's - and for once, neither looked away.

-o-

The cicadas had quieted by the time they stepped onto the school’s front path, the warm hush of summer night settling over them like a blanket. Streetlights flickered on one by one, casting long shadows that tangled together as the group walked—Ryo attempting to balance a drumstick on his nose, Jun humming their newly-minted melody under his breath.
&quot;That was…&quot; Honoka began, then stopped. The words the most fun I’ve ever had in the Editorial Room lodged in her throat, too vulnerable to voice.
&quot;It was the best time I’ve ever had in the Editorial Room,&quot; She admitted, her cheeks flushing pink in the dim light. The confession left her lips tingling, as if she’d bitten into a stolen strawberry.
Nagano’s grin faltered for half a second. &quot;Wait—really? It’s usually just you in there, right?&quot; He adjusted his guitar strap, the leather creaking. &quot;Kinda thought you’d be sick of the place by now.&quot;
Honoka tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. &quot;We used to have five members. But after the third all-nighter formatting poetry submissions, everyone transferred to the Newspaper Club.&quot; She mimed a dramatic escape with her fingers. &quot;Now it’s just me and the weekly stack of unfinished haikus about cafeteria food.&quot;
&quot;So you’re like… the last samurai of student literature?&quot; Ryo chimed in, spinning a drumstick.
&quot;More like a glorified proofreader,&quot; Honoka laughed, but her fingers absently traced the ink stains on her sleeve—the badge of her lonely dedication.
Nagano studied her for a moment, the streetlight catching the thoughtful crease between his brows. &quot;Guess that makes this song your first real collaboration, huh?&quot;
The way he said it—like it mattered, like she mattered—sent a warm shiver down Honoka’s spine.
&quot;Which means we gotta give it a title worthy of Aoki Honoka’s editorial standards,&quot; Nagano declared, slinging his guitar case higher. &quot;So? What’re we calling our masterpiece, folks?&quot;
A chorus of voices erupted:
&quot;‘Eternal Youth’!&quot; Ryo crowed, nearly dropping his drumstick.
&quot;‘Racing Against the Sunset’,&quot; Jun intoned, as if announcing a samurai film.
&quot;‘Ode to my youger years’,&quot; Nagano added.
Haruki waited until the laughter subsided before adding. &quot;‘The Summer Fifty Years Ago.&quot;
Silence.
&quot;The hell kind of title is that?&quot; Ryo blinked.
&quot;Think about it,&quot; Haruki said, kicking a pebble down the path. &quot;When you’re old and gray, listening to this song again—it’ll take you right back here. To this summer. To now*.&quot;* She gestured around at them—Honoka’s ink-stained fingers, Nagano’s guitar pick gleaming in his palm, Jun’s trumpet case covered in peeling band stickers. &quot;It’s not just a song. It’s a time machine*.&quot;*
For a moment, no one spoke. A breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of warm pavement and distant rain.
Then Nagano slung an arm around Haruki’s neck, ruffling her hair. &quot;You’re a weird kid, Fujiyama. But that’s perfect*.&quot;*
Honoka’s smile was soft in the dim light. &quot;It really is.&quot;
And just like that, it stuck.
As they continue walking down the road, the boys reached their motorcycles first, their laughter and clattering gear fading into the humid night as Nagano swung his leg over the seat. He lingered just a moment longer than necessary, one hand on the handlebars as he turned back toward Honoka.
&quot;See you tomorrow, geniuses,&quot; he called, his smile visible even in the dim light. The engine roared to life, but not before Haruki caught the way Honoka's fingers twitched at her sides - as if resisting the urge to wave too enthusiastically.
Then it was just the two girls walking their familiar path home, the cicadas' song swelling around them like a living thing. The warm asphalt still radiated the day's heat through their shoe soles, and fireflies pulsed lazily along the overgrown ditch beside the road.
Then—whap! Honoka’s palm connected with Haruki’s upper arm.
&quot;Ow! What was that for?&quot; Haruki rubbed her arm, though the sting was more surprise than pain.
&quot;You're horrible,&quot; Honoka giggled, the sound bubbling up uncontrollably. Moonlight caught the edges of her smile as she ducked her head. &quot;All that scheming just to get me to talk to Nagano-kun.&quot;
Haruki shrugged, kicking a pebble down the road. &quot;Anything to prevent you from dying alone in your old age. You can't marry books, you know.&quot;
&quot;Shut up, Haruki-chan.&quot; But Honoka's laughter tangled with hers, blending into the summer night's chorus.
They walked in comfortable silence after that, shoulders occasionally bumping as they navigated the darkened path. The usual intersection approached too soon, where the streetlights formed a pool of yellow light that marked their parting spot.
&quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; Honoka said, already half-turned toward home.
But then -
&quot;Haruki-chan!&quot;
Honoka’s voice spun Haruki back around. There, framed by the halo of a streetlamp, Honoka stood with her arms wrapped around herself—not in hesitation, but as if holding the warmth of the day close.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, simple and sincere.
For once, Haruki had no joke ready. The words lodged in her throat, sudden and unexpected. So she just smiled—real and unguarded—and called back, &quot;You’re welcome!&quot;
Their waves mirrored each other, hands fluttering like the pages of an open book, until distance turned them into silhouettes.

            <Notes>On their first meeting, they discusses about what do they want to sing about during the end of summer festival,

Nagano said that they thought about writing about the spirit of youth,

And then after deciding about the theme and the music, it will be an upbeat music

They then discussed about the name of the song, nothing lands

Haruki then suggested the name, “The Summer Fifty Years Ago.”

Since they will one day in their old age, look back to this last summer they spent as a highschool student, 

They liked how it sounds.


Maybe in this chapter, Honoka will be so insecure about her poetry writing, thinking it was too cheesy, and abandoned it, scrapping the paper, only to find that Nagano took the paper and sung it in the evening. And turns out it worked well</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 6 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki didn’t know how long she had slept. Time had lost its meaning in the quiet, rain-soaked darkness of the abandoned house. When she had collapsed on the floorboards the night before, all she had wanted was shelter from the cold and the rain. Now, as she slowly opened her eyes, she felt disoriented, her mind struggling to piece together where she was.
She sat up, her body stiff and aching, and looked around. The first thing she noticed was that she was no longer wet. Her shirt, her skirt, her hair—all of it was dry, as if the storm had never happened. She patted herself down, her fingers brushing against the fabric of her uniform, now clean and crisp, as though freshly laundered.
But that wasn’t all. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she realized that the house itself had changed. Gone was the caved-in roof, the peeling paint, and the thick layers of moss and mold. The walls were smooth and clean, the wooden floorboards polished to a warm, golden sheen. The air no longer smelled of mildew and decay; instead, it carried the faint, comforting scent of cedar and tea.
Haruki got to her feet, her heart pounding in her chest. She turned in a slow circle, taking in the room around her. The windows, once cracked and grimy, now gleamed in the soft morning light. The furniture, which had been broken and covered in dust, was now whole and pristine, arranged neatly as if waiting for someone to return.
“What…?” she whispered, her voice barely audible. She reached out to touch the wall, half-expecting her hand to pass through it, as if this were all some kind of dream. But the wood was solid beneath her fingers, cool and smooth.
She stepped further into the house, her footsteps echoing softly on the floorboards. The hallway was lined with framed photographs, their faces blurred and indistinct, as if the memories they held had faded with time. The kitchen, which had been a mess of rusted appliances and broken cabinets, was now spotless, the counters gleaming and the stove polished to a mirror-like finish.
Haruki’s breath quickened as she moved through the house, her mind racing. Was she dreaming? Had she hit her head and slipped into some kind of hallucination? Or was this… something else entirely?
She stopped in the middle of the living room, her eyes drawn to a large mirror hanging on the wall. Her reflection stared back at her, wide-eyed and pale, but otherwise unchanged. She reached up to touch her face, half-expecting it to feel different, but it was still her. Still Haruki.
The realization grounded her, if only for a moment. She wasn’t dreaming. This was real. Or at least, it felt real.
Her gaze shifted to the front door, the one she had stumbled through last night. She walked over to it, her footsteps echoing softly on the polished floorboards. The door was solid and heavy, its wood smooth and unblemished. She reached for the handle and turned it, expecting it to open easily.
It didn’t budge.
She frowned and tried again, this time with more force. The handle rattled, but the door remained firmly shut. She leaned her shoulder against it, pushing with all her strength, but it was no use. The door was locked.
Haruki stepped back, her heart pounding. She glanced around the room, her eyes landing on the other door—the one at the back of the house. It was smaller, less imposing, but it was there, a faint glimmer of hope.
She crossed the room, her footsteps quickening as she approached the second door. This one was different, its frame painted a soft, inviting white. She hesitated for a moment, her hand hovering over the handle, before she turned it.
This time, the door opened.
A cool breeze brushed against her face as she stepped through the doorway, the air fresh and crisp. She found herself standing on a small porch, overlooking a garden that stretched out before her. The storm was gone, replaced by a clear, golden morning. The garden was lush and vibrant, filled with flowers in full bloom and trees heavy with fruit. A narrow path wound its way through the greenery, leading to a gate at the far end.
Haruki stared, her breath catching in her throat. This wasn’t possible. The house had been abandoned, surrounded by a dense, overgrown forest. And yet, here she was, standing in a place that felt like it belonged in a dream.
She stepped down from the porch, her feet sinking into the soft grass. The air was filled with the scent of flowers and earth, and the sound of birdsong echoed in the distance. She walked along the path, her hand brushing against the petals of the flowers as she passed. The gate at the end of the path stood open, inviting her to step through.
Haruki turned back to look at the house. It stood tall and proud, its windows gleaming in the sunlight. For a moment, she considered going back inside, but the thought of the locked front door stopped her. 

-o-

Haruki stood at the edge of the garden, the gate creaking softly behind her as it swung shut. Before her stretched a narrow paved road, its surface smooth and unblemished, as if it had been freshly laid. She frowned, her mind racing. She didn’t remember walking on a paved road last night. In fact, she was certain there had been nothing but dirt paths and overgrown trails leading to the abandoned house.
But here it was, undeniable and real, winding its way through the field of tall grass and disappearing into the distance. The road seemed to beckon her, its quiet stillness inviting her to follow.
Haruki hesitated, glancing back at the house. It stood serene and unchanging, its windows reflecting the golden light of the morning. The garden behind her was just as still, the flowers and trees frozen in time, as if waiting for her to make a decision.
She turned back to the road, her heart pounding in her chest. There was something about it—something that pulled at her, urging her forward. She didn’t know where it led, but she knew she couldn’t stay here. Not when the house felt so strange, so otherworldly.
Taking a deep breath, Haruki stepped onto the paved road. The surface was cool beneath her feet, the sound of her footsteps echoing softly in the quiet morning air. The tall grass swayed gently on either side of her, the breeze carrying the faint scent of earth and wildflowers.
As she walked, the road began to curve, leading her further away from the house and the garden. The landscape around her shifted subtly, the fields giving way to clusters of trees and small, rolling hills. In the distance, she could see the outline of a town, its rooftops glowing in the sunlight.

            <Title>Chapter 2 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The sky was a deep shade of purple, streaked with the last remnants of orange as the sun dipped below the horizon. Haruhi pedaled her bicycle alongside Aiko, the cool evening air brushing against her face. The streets were quiet, save for the occasional hum of a passing car or the distant laughter of children playing in a nearby park. The two friends chatted idly, their voices carrying in the stillness of the approaching night.
Eventually, they reached the point where their paths diverged. Aiko waved enthusiastically as she turned down her street. “See you tomorrow, Haruhi-chan! Don’t forget to submit that paper!”
Haruhi smiled and waved back. “I won’t! See you!”
She continued on her way, the rhythmic sound of her bicycle wheels against the pavement filling the silence. Soon, she turned onto a tree-lined street, where the houses grew larger and more imposing. Her own home stood at the end of the road, a traditional Japanese estate that exuded both elegance and isolation. The wooden gate creaked softly as she pushed it open, and she wheeled her bicycle into the garage, the dim light casting long shadows across the empty space.
The house itself was grand, with a sloping tiled roof and a meticulously maintained garden that seemed almost too perfect, as if it had been frozen in time. The sliding doors were made of polished wood, and the paper screens glowed faintly with the warm light from inside. Despite its beauty, the house often felt cold and empty, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath.
Haruhi slipped off her shoes at the entrance, placing them neatly on the shoe rack. She glanced at the other pairs—her father’s polished leather shoes were absent, as usual, but her mother’s modest flats were there. She was home early today.
“I’m back,” Haruhi called out, her voice echoing through the spacious hallway. The house seemed to swallow her words, leaving only silence in their wake.
Haruhi stepped into the house, the polished wooden floors cool beneath her socks. She closed the door softly behind her, careful not to make too much noise. The last thing she wanted was to draw her mother’s attention. She was tired, her shoulders heavy from the day, and all she wanted was to retreat to her room and lose herself in her sketchbook.
She tiptoed through the hallway, her footsteps barely audible. To her left was the open doorframe leading to the kitchen and dining area. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her mother sitting at the dining table, still in her tailored suit from work. Her laptop was open in front of her, its screen casting a faint glow on her face. Stacks of papers—student assignments waiting to be graded—were piled neatly beside her. Her mother’s glasses perched low on her nose as she scribbled notes in the margins of a worksheet.
Good, Haruhi thought, relief washing over her. She’s busy. Now’s my chance to slip through.
She quickened her pace, her hand already reaching for the banister of the stairs. But just as her foot touched the first step, her mother’s voice cut through the silence.
“Haruhi?” Her tone was stern and steady, the kind of voice that brooked no argument. “Come talk with me at the dining table.”
Haruhi froze, her heart sinking. She closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath to steady herself. “Yes, Mom,” she said, forcing her voice to sound neutral.
She turned and walked into the dining area, her shoulders tense. Her mother didn’t look up immediately, her pen still moving across the paper. Haruhi stood awkwardly by the table, her hands clasped behind her back, waiting.
Finally, her mother set down her pen and removed her glasses, setting them carefully on the table. She looked up at Haruhi, her expression unreadable. “How was school?” she asked, her voice calm but probing.
“It was fine,” Haruhi replied, her tone clipped. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, avoiding her mother’s gaze.
There was a brief silence between the two, broken only by the occasional click-clacking of her mother’s laptop keys. The sound was sharp and deliberate, each keystroke echoing in the quiet room. Haruhi stood awkwardly, her hands fidgeting behind her back, wishing she could just disappear upstairs.
Then her mother took a quick glance away from her laptop, her eyes narrowing as she noticed something on Haruhi’s uniform and face. “What is that on your uniform and face?” she asked, her voice tinged with disapproval.
Haruhi blinked, caught off guard. She looked down at her sleeve, where streaks of red and green paint had dried into a messy splatter. Her fingers instinctively brushed her cheek, and she felt the faint crust of paint there too. “Oh,” she said, surprised. “It’s just paint…”
Her mother sighed, setting down her pen and removing her glasses. “Have you been painting again in that club of yours?”
“Yes, Mom,” Haruhi said, her voice steady but defensive. “I’m the vice president of the club now, so I have to keep it running.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest. “You know…” she began, her tone softening but still firm, “you’re in your third year now. You’re about to finish high school. You can’t keep getting lost in your head anymore. One day, you’ll need to go to university, get a job, and support yourself.”
Haruhi stayed silent, her jaw tightening. Inside, her heart was a storm of emotions. She wanted to argue, to shout that she could keep getting lost in her head, that she could make a living as an artist, that she could decide her own future. She was tired of being told what to do, tired of feeling like her dreams were nothing more than childish fantasies. But the words stuck in her throat, heavy and unspoken.
All she could muster was another quiet, “Yes, Mom.”
Her mother’s gaze lingered on her for a moment longer before she turned back to her laptop. The click-clacking of the keys resumed, filling the silence. But then her mother paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, and looked up again. “Have you received your Career Plan papers yet?” she asked, her tone casual but probing. “You should have gotten one by now.”
Haruhi hesitated, then nodded. “Yes, I did.” She reached into her bag and pulled out the folded sheet of paper, holding it out reluctantly.
Her mother took it, scanning the form with a critical eye. “You should consider becoming a nurse, Haruhi,” she said, her voice matter-of-fact. “The pay is good, and you said you don’t want to become a doctor. I think nursing would suit you.”
Haruhi’s stomach twisted. She clenched her hands into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. “B-but I don’t want to become a nurse either, Mom,” she said, her voice trembling slightly.
Her mother’s eyes narrowed, and she set the paper down on the table. “Then what do you want to be?” she asked, her tone sharp.
There was a heavy silence between them, the air thick with tension. Haruhi’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing. She knew what she wanted to say, but the words felt like a betrayal, like they would shatter the fragile peace between them. Still, she couldn’t hold it in any longer.
“I want to go to art school,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. “I want to become an artist.”
The room fell silent, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Her mother stared at her, her expression unreadable. For a moment, Haruhi thought she might not have heard her. But then her mother’s lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes hardened.
“What?” her mother said finally, her voice low and incredulous.
Haruhi flinched but stood her ground. “I want to go to art school,” she repeated, her voice firmer this time. “I want to study art and become an artist.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest. “An artist?” she said, her tone dripping with disbelief. “Haruhi, do you hear yourself? Do you have any idea how difficult it is to make a living as an artist? How unstable that kind of life is?”
“I know it’s not easy,” Haruhi said, her voice rising slightly. “But it’s what I love. It’s what I’m good at. I don’t want to spend my life doing something I hate just because it’s ‘stable.’”
Her mother’s eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her voice calm, which somehow made it worse. “You’re being naive, Haruhi. Dreams don’t pay the bills. You need to think about your future, about how you’re going to support yourself.”
“I am thinking about my future!” Haruhi shot back, her voice breaking. “I’m thinking about what makes me happy, not just what makes you happy!”
The words hung in the air, sharp and unyielding. Haruhi’s chest heaved as she stared at her mother, her eyes burning with unshed tears. Her mother’s expression softened for a moment, but then she sighed and shook her head.
“You’ll understand one day,” she said, her voice tired. “When you’re older, you’ll see that I’m only trying to protect you.”
Haruhi didn’t respond. She couldn’t. The lump in her throat was too big, the weight of her mother’s words too heavy. She turned and walked out of the dining room, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. As she climbed the stairs, her vision blurred with tears, but she blinked them away, refusing to let them fall.
When she reached her room, she closed the door behind her and leaned against it, sliding down to the floor. Her sketchbook lay on her desk, its pages filled with drawings and paintings that felt like pieces of her soul. She stared at it, her heart aching.
After a moment, she stood up and walked over to her desk, where her Career Plans paper lay crumpled at the edge. She smoothed it out, her fingers trembling slightly as she picked up a pen. Her mind raced, but for the first time in a long time, it felt clear. She knew what she wanted. She had always known.
With a deep breath, she wrote in neat, deliberate letters: Tokyo University Fine Arts Program.
Her hand shook as she set the pen down, but her resolve was steady. This was her choice. Her future. And no one—not her mother, not her father, not anyone—was going to take it away from her.
She stared at the paper for a long moment, the words staring back at her like a declaration of war. It was a small act of defiance, but it felt monumental. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt a flicker of hope.
“I’ll show them,” she whispered to herself, her voice trembling but determined. “I’ll prove them wrong.”
She folded the paper carefully and placed it back in her bag, ready to submit it tomorrow. As she sat down at her desk and opened her sketchbook, her heart felt lighter. The colors on the page seemed brighter, the lines sharper, as if they too were emboldened by her decision.
For now, all she could do was keep painting, keep dreaming. But this time, it felt different. This time, it felt like the beginning of something new.

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font of
their house. This PDF file was generated via Scrivener's compile
feature and was created from the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all
caps about halfway down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five

spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word
from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as

         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated

&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.

can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert

word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit

crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Title>Chapter 12 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>Haruki continued walking along the paved road that wound through the forest, the fading light casting long shadows across the path. The scene was serene, a stark contrast to the rainy, muddy night when she had first stumbled upon this place in the present. The air was crisp and cool, filled with the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. It was peaceful, almost idyllic, and for a moment, Haruki allowed herself to forget the weight of everything that had happened.
As she walked, the small house came into view. It was a humble cottage, nestled among the trees, its wooden walls weathered but sturdy. The roof was sloped and tiled, and the windows were framed by simple shutters. It wasn’t grand or imposing, but it had a quiet charm that made it feel like home—at least, for now.
Haruki approached the house, her footsteps soft against the paved road. The two doors—one at the front and one at the back—stood as a reminder of the strange, almost magical quality of this place. She paused for a moment, her hand resting on the handle of the front door, before pushing it open and stepping inside.
The air inside was cool and still, the faint scent of wood and earth filling her nostrils. The interior was simple but cozy, with a small wooden table, a few chairs, and a fireplace in the corner. The floorboards creaked softly under her feet as she walked further in, her bag slung over her shoulder.
Haruki set her bag down by the table, her back against the wooden chair. She closed her eyes, letting out a long breath as the events of the day replayed in her mind. Meeting Nagano and Honoka, seeing them as they truly were—young, vibrant, and full of life—had been both exhilarating and overwhelming. She had seen a side of her parents she had never known, a side that made her heart ache with a strange mix of joy and sadness.
Haruki sat at the small wooden table, her thoughts swirling like a storm. She couldn’t stop thinking about what she had done in the present—how she had run away from home, angry and hurt, after her parents had crushed her dreams. She had been so consumed by her anger that she hadn’t stopped to consider how they might feel. Did they regret their decision? Were they worried about her? Or were they just as stubborn and unyielding as ever?
But now, after meeting Nagano and Honoka—the younger versions of her parents—she was reminded of the good times she had shared with them. She thought about her father singing Ue o Muite Arukō to her when she was little, his voice warm and comforting. She thought about her mother, who, despite her busy schedule, would sometimes talk to her or ask for help in the kitchen. Those moments had been rare, but they had been precious.
She also thought about Aiko and Akihito, her best friends. What were they thinking now? Were they worried about her? Did they think she had disappeared like Yaeko Matsuda? The thought made her chest tighten. If she didn’t return, would she become just another rumor—a girl who went missing before graduation because of an argument with her parents? The reputation of the Art Club would be tarnished, with two vice-presidents disappearing under similar circumstances.
Haruki missed everything from her time—her strict parents, her best friends, her club. She missed the life she had left behind, even if it hadn’t been perfect.
Her gaze drifted to the door opposite her—the one she had come through. Beyond that door was the present, the 2000s, her real home. She got up from the table and walked over to it, her heart pounding. She grabbed the handle and tried to pry it open, but it wouldn’t budge. She nudged it, then forced it, slamming her body against it in desperation. But the door remained firmly shut, and all she succeeded in doing was hurting her shoulders and knocking over the items on the nearby shelves.
Haruki sat on the floor, rubbing her sore shoulders and wincing in pain. As she caught her breath, she noticed something among the scattered items—a leather-bound book. It was red with brass edges, and its pages had fallen open to a specific spread. Haruki picked it up, her curiosity piqued.
On the left page was an illustration of the door before her, the sketch eerily accurate. The details were precise, from the grain of the wood to the brass handle. It was as if someone had drawn it from life.
On the right page was a poem, its text surrounded by intricate illustrations and decorations that looked medieval—far older than the time she was currently in. The words were written in an elegant script, and they read:
“When the sun meets the moon
When the dark meets the light
When the evil meets the good
When the man meets the lady
The gate shall open.”
Haruki stared at the page, her mind racing. At first, she thought it was just a vintage book, perhaps something the previous owner of the cottage had collected. But the illustration of the door and the cryptic poem made her wonder if there was more to it. Was this a clue? A way back to her own time?
She closed the book and placed it back on the shelf, her thoughts still swirling. As she did, she took a moment to look around the cabin more carefully. Now that she would be spending the night here, she figured she might as well familiarize herself with the place.
The cabin was small but cozy, filled with an eclectic mix of vintage items. Maps were pinned to the walls, their edges frayed and yellowed with age. Shelves were lined with old books, their spines cracked and worn, and collections of bottled ships sat neatly arranged, their tiny sails frozen in time. Whoever owned this place had a clear love for history and craftsmanship.
But what caught Haruki’s attention the most were the walls lined with experimental still-life paintings. The strokes were bold and expressive, the colors vibrant yet harmonious. There were also sketches of the town—plein-air paintings that seemed to have been done by hand, capturing the essence of the streets and buildings with remarkable detail. Haruki leaned closer to one of the paintings, her eyes scanning the bottom corner for a signature. It was written in a kanji she didn’t recognize, but she could make out the name “Matsuko.”
Haruki stepped back, her curiosity piqued. Whoever Matsuko was, they clearly had a passion for art—something Haruki could relate to. She felt a strange sense of gratitude toward this mysterious person. Whoever they were, they seemed to understand her in a way no one else did. Maybe they even knew why she had traveled back in time. Haruki didn’t mind waiting for their return, if they ever came back at all.
The cabin itself was small but functional. It had one bedroom, one bathroom, and a combined kitchen, living room, and dining area in the center. It was clearly designed for one person, and Haruki couldn’t help but feel a sense of comfort in its simplicity.
She made her way to the bedroom, where an iron-frame bed stood against the wall. In front of it was a wardrobe, its wooden doors slightly ajar. Haruki opened it and found a collection of clothes inside. She inspected them, surprised to find that they were about her size. There were pajamas, shirts, and even school uniforms that seemed to fit her perfectly. Whoever Matsuko was, they had left behind a wardrobe that felt almost tailor-made for Haruki.
Relieved to have spare clothes to borrow, Haruki decided to take a bath. She grabbed a set of pajamas and a towel from the wardrobe and headed to the bathroom. The small space was clean and functional, with a wooden tub and a shelf lined with basic toiletries. Haruki turned on the water, letting it fill the tub as she undressed and slipped into the warm, soothing embrace of the bath.
As she soaked, her mind wandered back to the events of the day—meeting Nagano and Honoka, discovering the cabin, and finding the mysterious book. She didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but for now, she allowed herself to relax, the tension in her shoulders easing as the warm water enveloped her.
When she was done, Haruki dried off and changed into the borrowed pajamas. They were soft and comfortable, and she felt a strange sense of belonging as she slipped them on. She returned to the bedroom and climbed into the bed, the sheets cool against her skin.
As she settled in, her eyes wandered to the bedside cabinet, where a sketchbook lay neatly placed. At first, she felt a flicker of delight. The cover was worn but well-loved, and in the top right corner was that familiar kanji again: Matsuko. This must belong to them, she thought.
Haruki reached for the sketchbook, her fingers brushing against its textured cover. But as she opened it, her excitement turned to shock. The sketchbook was from a brand she recognized—the exact same brand she used in the present time. Her heart raced as she flipped through the pages, her eyes widening at what she saw.
The sketches and watercolor paintings inside were unmistakably of modern-day Japan. She recognized the sleek, towering buildings, the ubiquitous vending machines, and the modern cars that filled the streets. There were even detailed drawings of places she knew well—her school, the Art Club room, and the streets of her hometown. The dates scribbled in the margins confirmed it: these sketches were from the 2000s.
Haruki’s mind raced. This Matsuko person wasn’t just a collector of vintage items or an artist from the past. They were a fellow time traveler—someone who had also been pulled into this strange, unfamiliar world. And if Matsuko had left this sketchbook behind, maybe they had found a way back to their own time. Maybe they could help Haruki do the same.
Excitement bubbled up inside her as she grabbed a pen from the bedside table. She flipped to a blank page in the sketchbook and began writing a note:

“Dear Matsuko,
I don’t know who you are or how you ended up here, but I think we’re in the same situation. I’ve borrowed your cabin for a while, until I can find a way back to my time. If you come back, please leave a message for me. I’d love to talk.
Sincerely,
Haruki Fujiyama.”

She closed the sketchbook and placed it back on the cabinet, her heart still pounding. But as she sat there, her fingers twitched with a familiar itch. It had been so long since she had held a sketchbook, and the urge to draw was overwhelming.
Haruki opened the sketchbook again, flipping to a fresh page. She picked up the pen and began to doodle, her hand moving almost instinctively. First, she drew a caricature of Mr. Genzo, his stern expression exaggerated to comical proportions. Then she sketched Honoka, her shy smile and flustered cheeks captured in quick, confident lines. Sakura came next, her cheerful demeanor shining through, followed by Nagano, his guitar slung over his shoulder and a mischievous grin on his face.
As she drew, a smile tugged at her lips. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt a sense of joy and freedom. The act of creating, of putting her thoughts and emotions onto paper, was like coming home. She lost herself in the sketches, the world around her fading away as she focused on the lines and shapes.
When she finally put the pen down, her heart felt lighter. She didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but for now, she was grateful for this moment of peace. She closed the sketchbook and placed it back on the cabinet, then lay down in the bed, pulling the sheets up to her chin.
As she drifted off to sleep, her mind wandered back to the sketchbook and the mysterious Matsuko. Whoever they were, they had left behind a piece of themselves—a connection to Haruki’s own time and a glimmer of hope that she wasn’t alone in this strange journey.
And maybe, just maybe, they held the key to finding her way back home.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 5 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki ran and ran, the click-clacking of her school-issued shoes breaking the stillness of the night. The sound of crickets and cicadas filled the air, their rhythmic chirping a stark contrast to the chaos in her mind. Tears streamed down her cheeks, blurring her vision, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t. She didn’t want to believe what she had heard. She didn’t want to face it.
Her breath came in ragged gasps, her chest burning with every step. The cool night air whipped against her face, but it did nothing to soothe the fire raging inside her. She ran past darkened houses, their windows glowing faintly with the warm light of families inside. Families who, unlike hers, might understand. Families who might support their children’s dreams instead of crushing them.
She didn’t know how far she had gone. The streets were unfamiliar now, the shadows of trees stretching long and eerie across the pavement. The moon hung low in the sky, its pale light casting an otherworldly glow over everything. Her white sailor school uniform stood out against the dark backdrop of the night, a ghostly figure darting through the stillness.
Her legs ached, her feet throbbing in her stiff leather shoes, but she pushed herself to keep going. She didn’t know where she was headed. She didn’t care. All she knew was that she couldn’t stop. If she stopped, the weight of everything would catch up to her—her father’s harsh words, her mother’s quiet resignation, the truth about Yaeko Matsuda. It would all come crashing down, and she wasn’t ready to face it.
As Haruki ran, the sky opened up. At first, it was just a drizzle, the faint patter of raindrops against the pavement barely noticeable amidst the chaos in her mind. But as she continued, the rain grew heavier, the drops falling faster and harder until they soaked through her uniform, clinging to her skin like a second layer. The cool water mixed with the tears on her cheeks, blurring the line between the storm outside and the storm within.
She looked around, her vision blurred by rain and tears. The streets were empty now, the houses dark and silent. In the distance, she saw the outline of a forest, its trees swaying gently in the wind. Without thinking, she turned and ran toward it, her shoes slipping on the wet pavement.
The forest was dense, the canopy of leaves above her providing some shelter from the rain. She stumbled through the underbrush, her breath coming in ragged gasps, until she finally reached a clearing. There, she stopped, leaning against a tree as she tried to catch her breath. The rain was softer here, the sound of it hitting the leaves above creating a soothing rhythm.
For a moment, she stood there, her chest heaving, her mind racing. Then, slowly, she sank to the ground, her back against the tree. She pulled her knees to her chest, wrapping her arms around them as the tears came again, hot and silent.
The forest was quiet, the only sounds the gentle patter of rain and the occasional rustle of leaves against the rain. Haruki closed her eyes, letting the cool air wash over her. She felt small here, insignificant, like the world had swallowed her whole. But in a strange way, it was comforting. The forest didn’t judge her. It didn’t demand anything from her. It just was.
She stared out into the darkness, her mind replaying the confrontation with her parents. Her father’s stern face, her mother’s quiet pleading, the way they had looked at her when she shouted at them. And Yaeko Matsuda… the truth about her death. It was too much. It was all too much.
Haruki buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking as she cried. She felt lost, adrift in a sea of expectations and fears, with no way out. But even as the tears fell, a small, stubborn part of her refused to give up. She couldn’t let this be the end. She couldn’t let her dreams die, not like this. Not like Yaeko.

-o-
The rain went on and on, growing more intense with each passing minute. The sound of it pounding against the leaves and the ground was deafening, a relentless drumbeat that matched the chaos in Haruki’s mind. After what felt like an eternity, she rose unsteadily to her feet, her body trembling from the cold and exhaustion. Her movements were slow and labored, her walk more like a limp, as if every step required the last ounce of strength she had left.
Her uniform clung to her skin, soaked through and heavy with rainwater. Her hair was plastered to her face, and her shoes squelched with every step. The rain had taken its toll, leaving her shivering and weak, but she forced herself to keep moving. She needed shelter. She needed to get out of the storm.
If anyone had seen her in that moment, they might have mistaken her for something out of an urban legend—a wisp, a ghost, a walking dead. Her pale skin glowed faintly in the darkness, her white uniform a stark contrast against the shadows of the forest. Her movements were slow and deliberate, her eyes hollow and distant, as if she were no longer fully human.
She walked and walked, her legs dragging through the mud and underbrush. The forest seemed endless, the trees closing in around her like silent sentinels. But then, in the distance, she saw it—a rectangular shape barely visible through the rain. Her heart leapt, and she forced herself to move faster, her limp becoming more pronounced as she stumbled toward the silhouette.
As she drew closer, the shape became clearer. It was a house, its outline stark against the darkness. But something about it felt… off. The windows were dark, the paint peeling from the walls. The garden was overgrown, the fence sagging and broken. It was abandoned.
Haruki hesitated for a moment, her breath coming in shallow gasps. But the rain was relentless, and she had no other choice. She limped toward the house, her feet slipping on the wet ground. The door was slightly ajar, creaking softly in the wind. She pushed it open, the hinges groaning in protest, and stepped inside.
Water dripped from her skirt and shirt, pooling on the dusty floorboards. The air inside was damp and musty, the smell of mildew and decay filling her nostrils. The house was silent, save for the sound of the rain pounding against the roof. It was empty, abandoned, but for now, it was shelter.
Haruki’s legs gave out beneath her, and she collapsed onto the floorboards, her body sinking into the worn wood. The storm was no longer hitting her, the relentless rain and wind now muffled by the walls of the house. For the first time in what felt like hours, she could breathe. The air inside was warmer, almost comforting, as if the house itself were wrapping her in a fragile embrace.
Her eyelids grew heavy, her vision blurring as exhaustion finally caught up with her. She tried to fight it, to stay awake, but her body refused to obey. The warmth of the house, the stillness, the soft patter of rain on the roof—it all lulled her into a sense of safety, however fleeting.
Her thoughts drifted, fragmented and hazy. She thought of her parents, their faces etched with disappointment and fear. She thought of Yaeko Matsuda, her bright smile and the way she had encouraged Haruki to keep painting. She thought of the Art Club, the one place where she had felt like she belonged. And she thought about her future, the path her parents had laid out for her, and the one she so desperately wanted to carve for herself.
But those thoughts were distant now, fading into the background as sleep pulled her under. Her breathing slowed, her body relaxing against the floorboards. The last thing she felt was the faint warmth of the house, the last thing she heard was the gentle rhythm of the rain.
And then, she was gone, lost in a deep, dreamless sleep.

            <Text>The sun blazed overhead, casting a golden glow over the schoolyard. Nagano sat in the shade of a concrete shelter, his back against the wall and his guitar resting on his lap. His friends were a short distance away, their laughter and shouts filling the air as they played a game of baseball. But Nagano was deep in concentration, his fingers carefully threading a new string onto his guitar. The upper E string had snapped earlier, and he was determined to fix it before practice.
As he worked, a shadow fell over him, growing closer and closer. Nagano didn’t look up, assuming it was one of his friends coming to pester him. “Look, man,” he said, his tone half-amused, half-annoyed, “I’m busy here. You can just go on ahead—”
He paused, his hands stilling as he caught a glimpse of the figure standing in front of him. It wasn’t one of his friends. It was Haruki.
“Wait, Haruki?” he said, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise.
Haruki stood there, her usual paint-stained seifuku uniform slightly disheveled, her sleeves rolled up to her elbows. In her hands were two bottles of soda, condensation dripping down the sides. But what caught Nagano’s attention most was the look on her face—a determined, almost fierce expression that he hadn’t seen before.
“Hey,” Haruki said, her voice steady but firm. She held out one of the sodas to him. “I brought you this.”
Nagano blinked, his confusion evident. “Uh… thanks?” he said, taking the bottle hesitantly. He glanced over at his friends, who were now watching the interaction with curious grins, before turning back to Haruki. “What’s this for?”
Haruki smiled, her expression softening. “It’s an apology,” she said, her tone sincere. “For lashing out at you yesterday. I… I had a bad day.”
Nagano laughed, the sound warm and easy. “It’s okay. I didn’t think much of it. I just didn’t realize you were having such a rough time.”
Haruki giggled, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly. For a while, they sat in comfortable silence, the sounds of Nagano’s friends playing baseball filling the air. The crack of the bat, the shouts of encouragement, the occasional burst of laughter—it all blended into a lively backdrop as Haruki took a sip from her soda. Nagano occasionally did the same, though his focus remained on his guitar.
He finished placing the new string on the fretboard and began tuning it, plucking each string and adjusting the pegs until the notes rang clear. “There you go!” he said, grinning to himself as he strummed a chord. “Good as new!”
Haruki watched him, a small smile playing on her lips. “Say, Nagano,” she began, her tone casual but curious, “you said you wanted to play on a stage, right?”
“Yeah, I guess so,” Nagano said, his fingers idly playing a few chords. “I’ve done it now and then with some of my friends who also play music. But I think people get bored hearing the same things over and over, so they just stopped bothering.”
Haruki raised an eyebrow, amused. “Huh? You’ve already performed? And you’re still unsatisfied?”
Nagano shrugged, his grin turning sheepish. “I mean, it’s fun and all, but it’s not exactly what I dreamed of, you know?”
Haruki tilted her head, her curiosity piqued. “What kind of performance do you want to do before you graduate, then?”
Nagano’s expression grew thoughtful as he strummed another chord. “I just want to play for a happy crowd,” he said, his voice softer now. “And I guess that means I need to be sincere with what I’m playing. Not just covering other people’s songs, but playing something I wrote myself.”
Haruki’s eyes lit up. “Do you and your friends have an original song?”
Nagano chuckled, scratching the back of his neck. “We do, but… it’s bad. I’m good at the guitar, and my friends are great at their instruments, but none of us are good with words. The lyrics always fall flat.”
Haruki sat there for a moment, her mind racing. Then, like a lightbulb flicking on, an idea struck her. She leaned closer to Nagano, lowering her voice to a whisper. “What if… you got someone to help with the lyrics? Someone who’s good with words?”
Nagano blinked, his brow furrowing. “Like who?”
Haruki grinned. “Like Aoki Honoka.”
Nagano’s eyes widened, and he leaned back, clearly taken aback. “Aoki-san? From the Literature Club? Do you think she’d even consider it? I mean, I know those clubs are usually super busy, and after what you told me yesterday… I’m not sure she’d want to work with me.”
Haruki waved a hand dismissively. “Don’t worry about that. I’m good friends with her. I can make it happen.”
Nagano stared at her, his expression a mix of skepticism and hope. “You really think so?”
Haruki nodded, her determination unwavering. “I know so. Just leave it to me.”
Nagano grinned, his usual confidence returning. “Alright. If you can pull this off, I owe you one.”
Haruki laughed, standing up and brushing off her uniform. “You’d better believe it. Now, finish tuning that guitar. You’re going to need it.”
As she walked away, Nagano watched her go, a smile tugging at his lips. For the first time in a while, he felt a spark of excitement—not just about playing music, but about the possibilities that lay ahead.</Text>
            <Notes>Haruki approaches Nagano and apologised 

There she brings up his wish to one day play in front of a crowd

Nagno sighed, saying that it was just a dream

Haruki asked whether he wants to do that for real 

Nagano confessed that he had done that for some time, he and some of his friends did play music together sometimes. But it’s usually just them covering an existing song.

Haruki asked why is that

Nagano said that it was because none of them are good with words. They aren’t good at making good lyrics

Haruki then got an idea, and whispered to Nagano

Nagano was puzzled, asking whether Aoki-san would even consider such an offer

Haruki said that she is good friends with her, and she can make that happen

            <Text>The morning sunlight streamed through the classroom windows, casting a warm glow over the rows of desks. Haruki sat at her usual spot, her sketchbook open in front of her, pencil moving swiftly across the page. Instead of her classmates, the desks in her drawing were occupied by whimsical creatures—a fox with nine tails lounged in the corner, a dragon coiled around the teacher’s podium, and a flock of tiny winged sprites flitted through the air. A smirk tugged at her lips as she added the finishing touches to a griffin perched smugly on Aiko’s desk.
Aiko, seated beside her, leaned over to peek at the sketch. “You look unusually happy today,” she noted, her tone equal parts curious and suspicious. “Did something good happen?”
Across from them, Akihito sat with his arms crossed, half-listening while flipping through his own notebook. He raised an eyebrow at Haruki’s expression but didn’t comment.
Haruki didn’t look up, her pencil still moving. “I submitted my Career Plan,” she said, her voice light and sing-songy.
Aiko’s eyes widened, and she practically shot forward in her chair. “You did?!” she exclaimed, much too loud for the classroom. A few students glanced their way, but Aiko didn’t seem to care. “What did you pick?”
Haruki finally looked up, drawing out the moment with an infuriatingly smug grin. “Tokyo University,” she said, pausing dramatically. “Fine Arts program.”
Aiko and Akihito reacted at the same time—
“What?!” Aiko gasped, her eyes sparkling with surprise.
“WHAT?!” Akihito groaned, his tone laced with horror.
Meanwhile, Akihito rubbed his temples as if physically pained. “Look, I know you’re impulsive and stubborn as a mule, but I didn’t think you’d just impulsively decide the trajectory of your career in a day, let alone from my off-hand remarks.” He stared at her in disbelief.
Haruki scoffed, half-annoyed. “Look, you were the one who suggested Tokyo University yesterday!”
“Suggested!” Akihito emphasized the word. “I was thinking at least you’d put it into consideration as one of your choices, not nose-dive into it!”
“But I want to go to Tokyo University,” Haruki said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Akihito exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Look—” he started, his voice filled with exasperation. “Did at least your parents approve of it?”
“No,” Haruki said in a sing-songy tone.
Akihito stared at her, deadpan. “Of course.”
Aiko snorted, clapping Haruki on the back. “Well, you’re in for an interesting conversation at home.”
Haruki grinned, twirling her pencil between her fingers. “Oh, I’m well aware.”
Akihito groaned, dropping his head onto his desk in defeat, “You’re crazy.”
Haruki shrugged, her pencil still moving. “Maybe. But it’s my future, not theirs.”
Aiko leaned back in her chair, running a hand through her hair. “Wow. I mean, I knew you were stubborn, but this is next level. What are you going to do when they find out?”
Haruki’s smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. “I’ll deal with it when the time comes,” she said, her tone casual. “For now, I’m just happy I finally made a decision.”
Akihito shook his head. “You’re unbelievable, you know that? But hey, It takes guts to go after what you want.”
Haruki chuckled, her smug expression softening. “Thanks. That means a lot.”
The bell rang, signaling the start of class, and the room filled with the sound of shuffling papers and murmured conversations. Haruki closed her sketchbook and tucked it into her bag, her mind already wandering to the future. For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was in control of her own destiny.

-o-

The school day had ended, and the hallways buzzed with the chatter of students heading to clubs, cram school, or home. Haruki stretched her arms above her head as she walked, a grin spreading across her face. “Ahh, I’ve been waiting for this all week,” she mused aloud. “Today’s the plein air session! I wonder where we’ll go this time. Maybe the riverside? Or that garden behind the old shrine? Ugh, I can’t wait to just sit outside and paint.”
Aiko trailed beside her, shaking her head. “You’re way too excited for someone who just turned their entire career plan into an act of rebellion.”
Behind them, Akihito sighed, his hands stuffed into his pockets as he matched their pace. “I thought you’d at least talk with your parents and try to convince them, Haruki,” he said, his tone serious. “Arguing against your parents is one thing, but going against them is another.”
“Yeah,” Aiko chimed in, nodding sagely. “You know, like, make a PowerPoint presentation or something. ‘Top Ten Reasons Why I Should Go to Art School.’”
Haruki smirked. “You’re siding with him, Aiko? I thought you were all about rebelling against parental expectations with me.”
“I know,” Aiko groaned dramatically, throwing her hands up. “But me arguing with my parents is one thing—we argue all the time. You arguing with your parents is another thing entirely.” She gave Haruki a pointed look. “Your parents are scary.”
“Yeah, look.” Akihito shot her a skeptical glance. “Tell me you’ve at least discussed this with one of them.”
Haruki smirked but didn’t slow her pace. “I talked with my mom,” she said simply.
Akihito narrowed his eyes. “And your dad?”
Haruki shrugged. “He wasn’t around,” she said, her voice casual. “But I don’t think he’d care.”
Akihito let out a sharp breath, running a hand through his hair. “You’re crazy,” he muttered. “Do you even hear yourself? Your dad’s not just some businessman—he’s the CEO of a major automotive company. Of course he’d care!”
Haruki stopped in her tracks and turned to face him, her expression calm but unwavering. “No, he wasn’t around,” she said, emphasizing each word. “He’s never around. He’s too busy with work to care about what I do.”
Akihito frowned but didn’t argue. Aiko shifted uncomfortably beside them, her gaze darting between the two.
Haruki sighed, gripping her sketchbook tighter. “Look, I know it sounds reckless, but I can’t keep waiting for their approval. If I do, I’ll never get to live my life. I have to take this step, even if it’s scary.”
Akihito’s jaw tightened. “That’s not the point. You might not care about what they think, but they’ll definitely care about you going against them. And your parents aren’t exactly the ‘let it go’ type.”
Haruki nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I know. But I’ll figure it out. I always do.”


-o-

As Haruki sled the door open to the arts club room, the room was buzzing with energy as club members prepared for their weekly plein air session. Easels were being adjusted, canvases stacked, sketchbooks flipped open, and tubes of paint uncapped. The faint scent of oil paint and graphite filled the air, mixing with the chatter of students discussing the best locations for today’s outing.
At the center of it all, like a captain amidst a storm of creativity, stood Makoto, the Art Club’s president. He was giving instructions to a group of younger students, gesturing animatedly with a charcoal stick in hand.
But as Haruki scanned the room, something unusual caught her eye—someone who definitely wasn’t a regular in the Art Club.
Mrs. Kitagawa.
Haruki stiffened. What was the school counselor doing here?
Aiko and Akihito entered behind her, the three of them exchanging wary glances. Before Haruki could dwell on it, Makoto’s voice rang out over the hum of activity.
“Haruki! Mrs. Kitagawa wants to see you.”
A murmur of curiosity rippled through the club, but everyone quickly went back to their preparations.
Haruki exhaled, schooling her expression into something neutral. She slung her bag off her shoulder, setting it down in the corner, before making her way toward Mrs. Kitagawa.
Haruki crossed her arms, shifting her weight slightly as she faced Mrs. Kitagawa. “If this is about my Career Plans form, I swear I submitted it this morning,” she said, forcing a small, confident smile. “I didn’t forget.”
Mrs. Kitagawa nodded. “Yes, I received it.”
Haruki tilted her head. Then what is it?
“But that’s not why I called you here,” Mrs. Kitagawa continued, her tone even, measured.
Haruki’s stomach dipped slightly. Her fingers curled around the strap of her bag. “Then… why?”
There was a pause.
Mrs. Kitagawa exhaled softly before delivering the news. “Your father is in the teacher’s office. He’s here to pick you up for a family occasion.”
Haruki felt the words before she fully processed them—a strange weight settling in her chest, as if the air had thickened around her.
Her grip tightened on her bag. “What?”
Mrs. Kitagawa’s expression remained gentle but firm. “Your father requested that you leave with him immediately.”
Haruki’s pulse quickened. This had to be a mistake. Her father never just showed up like this. He was supposed to be too busy for things like unannounced visits.
And today—today—was the club’s plein air session.
“But I have club activities,” she argued, her voice steadier than she felt. “We’re heading out for plein air today, and Makoto needs my help with the first-years—I can’t be absent.”
“I understand,” Mrs. Kitagawa said, her voice soft but unwavering. “But this is your father’s request.”
Request.
No, this wasn’t a request. It was an order.
The weight in her chest sank lower. There was no room for negotiation here.
Slowly, reluctantly, she turned toward Akihito. “Can you cover for me?” she asked, her voice quieter now. “Help Makoto with the first-years?”
Akihito hesitated for a fraction of a second before nodding. “Yeah. Don’t worry about it.”
Haruki swallowed, then reached for her bag. The excitement from earlier—the rush of stepping into the clubroom, the anticipation of an afternoon spent outside with paint and sunlight—was gone, drained out of her like ink washing away in the rain.
Without another word, she followed Mrs. Kitagawa toward the door.
Aiko and Akihito stood in silence, watching her go. 

-o-

Haruki trailed behind Mrs. Kitagawa, her steps slower than they needed to be, as if dragging her feet might somehow delay the inevitable.
This is it…
The thought settled heavily in her chest, dull and suffocating. She watched as the club rooms passed by—each doorway revealing glimpses of students lost in their passions.
The soft melody of a violin drifted from the music room, accompanied by the occasional stumble of fingers pressing the wrong note. Someone in the literature club gestured wildly as they debated over a novel, voices overlapping in a lively discussion. Inside the manga club, students huddled around a table, sketching, erasing, redrawing—completely immersed in their craft.
They were all doing what they loved. Pursuing what made them feel alive.
Haruki swallowed hard. And I’m walking the green mile.
She felt it with every step—like she was heading toward something final, something irreversible. As if, the moment she reached that office, she wouldn’t just be facing her father.
She’d be facing the end of her dream.
Her fingers tightened around the strap of her bag.
No. Not yet.
She kept walking, but the weight in her chest only grew heavier.
Haruki stepped into the teacher’s office, her breath catching for a split second.
There he was.
Nagano Fujiyama.
Even in the casual setting of a school, he exuded the same commanding presence that made boardrooms fall silent upon his arrival. His tailored suit sat flawlessly on his frame, not a crease in sight. His dark hair, streaked with silver, was neatly pulled back, revealing sharp, assessing eyes that took in everything without a hint of warmth. Around his fingers gleamed heavy rings—symbols of wealth and power.
The nametag still hung from his neck, CEO of Fujiyama Automotive Company. As if he needed a reminder. 
As if she did.
Mrs. Kitagawa cleared her throat lightly, stepping aside as he offered her a slight bow.
&quot;Thanks for bringing my daughter,&quot; he said smoothly, his voice even, businesslike. Then, finally, he turned his gaze on Haruki.
“Haruki…”
Just her name. Simple. Unreadable.
She gripped the strap of her bag, her heartbeat quickening.
&quot;Come,&quot; he said, gesturing toward the hallway. &quot;We’re going to talk.&quot;
It wasn’t a request.

            <Notes>Explain Haruhi’s relationship with Yaeko Matsuda, the former Vice-President of the arts club


At the end when they arrive at the Arts Club room, they were met with Mrs. Kitagawa

They thought she still wanted the unsubmitted paper, and Haruki explained that she had submitted it, 

Mrs. Kitagawa then said that she had rechieved it, she’s here because Haruki’s Father is here at the teacher’s office to pick her up

Haruki argued that she still had Club Activities to attend to, but Mrs. Kitagawa said that it was her father’s order, and so she asked Akihito to take over as Vice-President and help Makoto who is the president during today’s plein air session.

            <Title>Chapter 2 RAW V2</Title>
            <Text>The sky was a deep shade of purple, streaked with the last remnants of orange as the sun dipped below the horizon. Haruki pedaled her bicycle alongside Aiko and Akihito, the cool evening air brushing against her face. The streets were quiet, save for the occasional hum of a passing car or the distant laughter of children playing in a nearby park. Their conversation drifted between idle chatter and the lingering weight of their discussion in the art room, though none of them spoke about Matsuda again.
Eventually, they reached the point where their paths diverged. Aiko stretched her arms above her head before turning down her street. “See you tomorrow, Haruki-chan! Don’t forget to submit that paper!”
Haruki laughed lightly. “I won’t! See you!”
As Aiko disappeared around the corner, Haruki turned her bike toward her own street, only to hear Akihito clear his throat beside her.
“Seriously, Haruki, you haven’t forgotten, right?” He adjusted his grip on the handlebars, casting her a skeptical glance. “You know Mrs. Kitagawa won’t go easy on you just because you’re the Art Club’s Vice President.”
Haruki huffed, rolling her eyes. “I know, I know. I’ll finish it when I get home.”
“Just making sure.” Akihito smirked before pedaling ahead, calling back over his shoulder, “I better not hear you complaining about an extension tomorrow!”
Haruki waved with a small smile, watching him disappear down the street before resuming her ride home. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and distant food stalls. 
She continued on her way, the rhythmic sound of her bicycle wheels against the pavement filling the silence. Soon, she turned onto a tree-lined street, where the houses grew larger and more imposing. Her own home stood at the end of the road, a traditional Japanese estate that exuded both elegance and isolation. The wooden gate creaked softly as she pushed it open, and she wheeled her bicycle into the garage, the dim light casting long shadows across the empty space.
The house itself was grand, with a sloping tiled roof and a meticulously maintained garden that seemed almost too perfect, as if it had been frozen in time. The sliding doors were made of polished wood, and the paper screens glowed faintly with the warm light from inside. Despite its beauty, the house often felt cold and empty, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath.
Haruki slipped off her shoes at the entrance, placing them neatly on the shoe rack. She glanced at the other pairs—her father’s polished leather shoes were absent, as usual, but her mother’s modest flats were there. She was home early today.
“I’m back,” Haruki called out, her voice echoing through the spacious hallway. The house seemed to swallow her words, leaving only silence in their wake.
Haruki stepped into the house, the polished wooden floors cool beneath her socks. She closed the door softly behind her, careful not to make too much noise. The last thing she wanted was to draw her mother’s attention. She was tired, her shoulders heavy from the day, and all she wanted was to retreat to her room and lose herself in her sketchbook.
She tiptoed through the hallway, her footsteps barely audible. To her left was the open doorframe leading to the kitchen and dining area. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her mother sitting at the dining table, still in her tailored suit from work. Her laptop was open in front of her, its screen casting a faint glow on her face. Stacks of papers—student assignments waiting to be graded—were piled neatly beside her. Her mother’s glasses perched low on her nose as she scribbled notes in the margins of a worksheet.
Good, Haruki thought, relief washing over her. She’s busy. Now’s my chance to slip through.
She quickened her pace, her hand already reaching for the banister of the stairs. But just as her foot touched the first step, her mother’s voice cut through the silence.
“Haruki?” Her tone was stern and steady, the kind of voice that brooked no argument. “Come talk with me at the dining table.”
Haruki froze, her heart sinking. She closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath to steady herself. “Yes, Mom,” she said, forcing her voice to sound neutral.
She turned and walked into the dining area, her shoulders tense. Her mother didn’t look up immediately, her pen still moving across the paper. Haruki stood awkwardly by the table, her hands clasped behind her back, waiting.
Finally, her mother set down her pen and removed her glasses, setting them carefully on the table, her nametag written “Honoka Fujiyama” is still etched on her tailored suit. She looked up at Haruki, her expression unreadable. “How was school?” she asked, her voice calm but probing.
“It was fine,” Haruki replied, her tone clipped. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, avoiding her mother’s gaze.
There was a brief silence between the two, broken only by the occasional click-clacking of her mother’s laptop keys. The sound was sharp and deliberate, each keystroke echoing in the quiet room. Haruki stood awkwardly, her hands fidgeting behind her back, wishing she could just disappear upstairs.
Then her mother took a quick glance away from her laptop, her eyes narrowing as she noticed something on Haruki’s uniform and face. “What is that on your uniform and face?” she asked, her voice tinged with disapproval.
Haruki blinked, caught off guard. She looked down at her sleeve, where streaks of red and green paint had dried into a messy splatter. Her fingers instinctively brushed her cheek, and she felt the faint crust of paint there too. “Oh,” she said, surprised. “It’s just paint…”
Her mother sighed, setting down her pen and removing her glasses. “Have you been painting again in that club of yours?”
“Yes, Mom,” Haruki said, her voice steady but defensive. “I’m the vice president of the club now, so I have to keep it running.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest. “You know…” she began, her tone softening but still firm, “you’re in your third year now. You’re about to finish high school. You can’t keep getting lost in your head anymore. One day, you’ll need to go to university, get a job, and support yourself.”
Haruki stayed silent, her jaw tightening. Inside, her heart was a storm of emotions. She wanted to argue, to shout that she could keep getting lost in her head, that she could make a living as an artist, that she could decide her own future. She was tired of being told what to do, tired of feeling like her dreams were nothing more than childish fantasies. But the words stuck in her throat, heavy and unspoken.
All she could muster was another quiet, “Yes, Mom.”
Her mother’s gaze lingered on her for a moment longer before she turned back to her laptop. The click-clacking of the keys resumed, filling the silence. But then her mother paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, and looked up again. “Have you received your Career Plan papers yet?” she asked, her tone casual but probing. “You should have gotten one by now.”
Haruki hesitated, then nodded. “Yes, I did.” She reached into her bag and pulled out the folded sheet of paper, holding it out reluctantly.
Her mother took it, scanning the form with a critical eye. “You should consider becoming a nurse, Haruki,” she said, her voice matter-of-fact. “The pay is good, and you said you don’t want to become a doctor. I think nursing would suit you.”
Haruki’s stomach twisted. She clenched her hands into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. “B-but I don’t want to become a nurse either, Mom,” she said, her voice trembling slightly.
Her mother’s eyes narrowed, and she set the paper down on the table. “Then what do you want to be?” she asked, her tone sharp.
There was a heavy silence between them, the air thick with tension. Haruki’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing. She knew what she wanted to say, but the words felt like a betrayal, like they would shatter the fragile peace between them. Still, she couldn’t hold it in any longer.
“I want to go to art school,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. “I want to become an artist.”
The room fell silent, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Her mother stared at her, her expression unreadable. For a moment, Haruki thought she might not have heard her. But then her mother’s lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes hardened.
“What?” her mother said finally, her voice low and incredulous.
Haruki flinched but stood her ground. “I want to go to art school,” she repeated, her voice firmer this time. “I want to study art and become an artist.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest. “An artist?” she said, her tone dripping with disbelief. “Haruki, do you hear yourself? Do you have any idea how difficult it is to make a living as an artist? How unstable that kind of life is?”
“I know it’s not easy,” Haruki said, her voice rising slightly. “But it’s what I love. It’s what I’m good at. I don’t want to spend my life doing something I hate just because it’s ‘stable.’”
Her mother’s eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her voice calm, which somehow made it worse. “You’re being naive, Haruki. Dreams don’t pay the bills. You need to think about your future, about how you’re going to support yourself.”
“I am thinking about my future!” Haruki shot back, her voice breaking. “I’m thinking about what makes me happy, not just what makes you happy!”
The words hung in the air, sharp and unyielding. Haruki’s chest heaved as she stared at her mother, her eyes burning with unshed tears. Her mother’s expression softened for a moment, but then she sighed and shook her head.
“You’ll understand one day,” she said, her voice tired. “When you’re older, you’ll see that I’m only trying to protect you.”
Haruki didn’t respond. She couldn’t. The lump in her throat was too big, the weight of her mother’s words too heavy. She turned and walked out of the dining room, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. As she climbed the stairs, her vision blurred with tears, but she blinked them away, refusing to let them fall.
When she reached her room, she closed the door behind her and leaned against it, sliding down to the floor. Her sketchbook lay on her desk, its pages filled with drawings and paintings that felt like pieces of her soul. She stared at it, her heart aching.
After a moment, she stood up and walked over to her desk, where her Career Plans paper lay crumpled at the edge. She smoothed it out, her fingers trembling slightly as she picked up a pen. Her mind raced, but for the first time in a long time, it felt clear. She knew what she wanted. She had always known.
With a deep breath, she wrote in neat, deliberate letters: Tokyo University Fine Arts Program.
Her hand shook as she set the pen down, but her resolve was steady. This was her choice. Her future. And no one—not her mother, not her father, not anyone—was going to take it away from her.
She stared at the paper for a long moment, the words staring back at her like a declaration of war. It was a small act of defiance, but it felt monumental. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt a flicker of hope.
“I’ll show them,” she whispered to herself, her voice trembling but determined. “I’ll prove them wrong.”
She folded the paper carefully and placed it back in her bag, ready to submit it tomorrow. As she sat down at her desk and opened her sketchbook, her heart felt lighter. The colors on the page seemed brighter, the lines sharper, as if they too were emboldened by her decision.
For now, all she could do was keep painting, keep dreaming. But this time, it felt different. This time, it felt like the beginning of something new.

            <Title>Chapter 7 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki walked along the narrow paved road, the bright glow of the morning light growing more intense with every step. The air was warm and golden, the kind of light that made everything seem softer, more dreamlike. She squinted against the brightness, her heart pounding as she approached the end of the road.
And then, she saw it.
The town spread out before her, its streets and buildings bathed in the warm morning light. But it wasn’t the town she knew. Not the one she had grown up in, with its modern buildings and bustling streets. This town was smaller, quieter, its buildings low and traditional, their wooden frames and tiled roofs weathered by time. The streets were narrow and winding, lined with old-fashioned storefronts and houses that looked like they belonged in a different era.
Haruki stopped in her tracks, her mouth falling open as she took in the sight. This was her town—she recognized the layout, the curve of the streets, the placement of the hills in the distance—but it was… different. Some of the buildings she remembered were missing, replaced by empty lots or smaller, older structures. Others were still there, but they looked different, their modern facades replaced by traditional wooden frames and sliding paper doors.
She turned in a slow circle, her mind struggling to make sense of what she was seeing. The town was alive, but it felt like a memory, a snapshot of a time long past. People moved through the streets, their clothes old-fashioned and their movements unhurried. A man in a worn kimono swept the steps of a small shop, while a woman in a simple dress balanced a basket of vegetables on her hip. A group of children ran past, their laughter echoing through the air.
She turned to where her house should have been, her heart pounding in her chest. But there was nothing there. Just an empty plot of land, overgrown with grass and wildflowers. No grand, traditional estate. No familiar gate or garden. Just emptiness.
Haruki stumbled back, her legs trembling beneath her. This couldn’t be real. It had to be a dream, a hallucination, something. But the air smelled of earth and woodsmoke, the sounds of the town were too vivid, too real. She reached out to touch the wall of a nearby building, her fingers brushing against the rough wood. It was solid. Real.
She was here. In the past.
Haruki stumbled back, her legs trembling beneath her. This couldn’t be real. It had to be a dream, a hallucination, something. But the air smelled of earth and woodsmoke, the sounds of the town were too vivid, too real. She reached out to touch the wall of a nearby building, her fingers brushing against the rough wood. It was solid. Real.
She stood there, her mind racing, trying to make sense of the situation. The town around her was alive, bustling with activity, but it felt like a world she didn’t belong to. The people, the buildings, the smells—it was all too much. She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath, trying to steady herself.
And then, from somewhere in the distance, she heard a shout.
“Hey!”
Haruki opened her eyes, glancing around. The voice didn’t seem directed at her, so she ignored it, her thoughts still swirling.
“Hey! Watch out!!” the voice shouted again, louder this time.
Haruki turned her head, her brow furrowing in confusion. Before she could react, something hard and fast smacked into the side of her head with a loud thwack. Pain exploded across her temple, and she stumbled, falling to the ground with a groan.
“Ow…” she muttered, clutching her head as she sat up. Her vision swam for a moment, and she blinked, trying to clear it. A baseball rolled to a stop a few feet away from her, its white surface scuffed and dirty.
“Oh no! Are you okay?!” a voice called out, footsteps pounding against the cobblestone street as someone ran toward her.
Haruki looked up, squinting against the sunlight, to see a boy skidding to a stop in front of her. He was around her age, his dark hair messy and his cheeks flushed from running. He wore a simple white shirt and shorts, and in his hand, he held a worn baseball glove.
“I’m so sorry!” he said, his voice filled with genuine concern. “I didn’t see you there! Are you hurt?”
Haruki winced, touching the side of her head where the ball had hit her. It throbbed, but the pain was already fading. “I’m… I’m fine,” she said, her voice shaky. “Just… surprised.”
The boy crouched down next to her, his eyes wide with worry. “Are you sure? That looked like it hurt. Here, let me help you up.” He held out his hand, and after a moment’s hesitation, Haruki took it.
He pulled her to her feet with surprising strength, his grip firm but gentle. Haruki swayed slightly, still feeling a little dizzy, but the boy steadied her with a hand on her shoulder.
“You’re not from around here, are you?” he asked, tilting his head as he studied her. “I’ve never seen you before.”
Haruki blinked, her mind still reeling from everything that had happened. “Uh… no,” she said, her voice hesitant. “I’m… just passing through.”
The boy’s eyes dropped to her uniform, and his face lit up with recognition. “Wait, are you from Fukumitsu High School?” he asked, pointing to the emblem on her blazer.
Haruki’s heart skipped a beat. Fukumitsu High School. Her school. The one she attended in the present. She nodded slowly, her voice barely above a whisper. “Yes… I’m from Fukumitsu.”
The boy grinned, his worry replaced by excitement. “Oh, great then! I’m from Fukumitsu too! Me and my friends are just hanging out, passing some time before class. Maybe you should join us so we can go to school together.”
Haruki stared at him, her mind struggling to process everything. Fukumitsu High School existed here, in this time. It was still standing, still a part of this town. The realization gave her a small flicker of hope, a tiny anchor in the sea of confusion she was drowning in.
“Uh… sure,” she said finally, her voice shaky. “I’ll join you.”
The boy’s grin widened, and he picked up the baseball, tossing it lightly in his hand. “Great! Follow me!”
Haruki followed him down the street, her mind racing. She didn’t know what was happening or how she had ended up here, but at least her school was still here. At least there was something familiar in this strange, unfamiliar world.
As they walked, Haruki’s curiosity got the better of her. She glanced at the boy, he had called himself—and asked, “What year is it?”
The boy stopped mid-step, turning to look at her with a puzzled expression. “What happened?” he asked, half-laughing. “You just met a someone, and the first thing you ask is what year it is? Not even an introduction?”
“O-oh, I’m sorry, excuse me.” Haruki stumbled, “I-I’m Haruki, Haruki Fujiyama.”
“Fujiyama?” The boy pondered, then studied her. “Have I seen you somewhere?”
“Umm, maybe it was just a coincidence,” She chuckled, “There’s many people with the name Fujiyama, afterall.”
“Oh right,” She chuckled, “Forgive me, but why do you want to know what year is it?”
Haruki flushed, realizing how strange her question must have sounded. “I… I was just curious,” she stammered, trying to cover her slip.
The boy shrugged, his easygoing smile returning. “Well, if you really want to know, it’s June first, 1961. The start of summer.”
Haruki froze, her feet stopping as if rooted to the ground. Her mind raced, trying to process what he had just said. 1961. She had traveled over six decades into the past. The realization hit her like a punch to the gut, leaving her breathless.
The boy stopped too, turning back to look at her with a confused frown. “What’s the matter?” he asked, his tone tinged with concern.
“Wait…” she said slowly,  Haruki stared at him, her heart pounding in her chest. her voice barely above a whisper. “Who are you?”
The boy blinked, taken aback by the intensity of her question. “Me?” he scoffed, before extending his hand with a grin. 
“I’m Nagano. Pleased to meet you.”
Haruki’s breath caught in her throat. 
“Nagano…” she repeated, her voice trembling. “Nagano Fujiyama?”
The boy—Nagano—nodded, his grin widening. 
“Yeah, that’s me. How’d you guess that?”
Haruki’s legs felt like they might give out beneath her. She stared at him, her mind reeling. This couldn’t be real. This couldn’t be the same man who had raised her, the stern, distant figure who had always seemed so unapproachable. The boy in front of her was nothing like that. He was kind, smiling, easygoing. There was no trace of the white hair or the stern voice she associated with her father. He was… different.
“D-dad?” she managed to ask weakly, her voice barely audible.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 12 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki continued walking along the paved road that wound through the forest, the fading light casting long shadows across the path. The scene was serene, a stark contrast to the rainy, muddy night when she had first stumbled upon this place in the present. The air was crisp and cool, filled with the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. It was peaceful, almost idyllic, and for a moment, Haruki allowed herself to forget the weight of everything that had happened.
As she walked, the small house came into view. It was a humble cottage, nestled among the trees, its wooden walls weathered but sturdy. The roof was sloped and tiled, and the windows were framed by simple shutters. It wasn’t grand or imposing, but it had a quiet charm that made it feel like home—at least, for now.
Haruki approached the house, her footsteps soft against the paved road. The two doors—one at the front and one at the back—stood as a reminder of the strange, almost magical quality of this place. She paused for a moment, her hand resting on the handle of the front door, before pushing it open and stepping inside.
The air inside was cool and still, the faint scent of wood and earth filling her nostrils. The interior was simple but cozy, with a small wooden table, a few chairs, and a fireplace in the corner. The floorboards creaked softly under her feet as she walked further in, her bag slung over her shoulder.
Haruki set her bag down by the table, her back against the wooden chair. She closed her eyes, letting out a long breath as the events of the day replayed in her mind. Meeting Nagano and Honoka, seeing them as they truly were—young, vibrant, and full of life—had been both exhilarating and overwhelming. She had seen a side of her parents she had never known, a side that made her heart ache with a strange mix of joy and sadness.
Haruki sat at the small wooden table, her thoughts swirling like a storm. She couldn’t stop thinking about what she had done in the present—how she had run away from home, angry and hurt, after her parents had crushed her dreams. She had been so consumed by her anger that she hadn’t stopped to consider how they might feel. Did they regret their decision? Were they worried about her? Or were they just as stubborn and unyielding as ever?
But now, after meeting Nagano and Honoka—the younger versions of her parents—she was reminded of the good times she had shared with them. She thought about her father singing Ue o Muite Arukō to her when she was little, his voice warm and comforting. She thought about her mother, who, despite her busy schedule, would sometimes talk to her or ask for help in the kitchen. Those moments had been rare, but they had been precious.
She also thought about Aiko and Akihito, her best friends. What were they thinking now? Were they worried about her? Did they think she had disappeared like Yaeko Matsuda? The thought made her chest tighten. If she didn’t return, would she become just another rumor—a girl who went missing before graduation because of an argument with her parents? The reputation of the Art Club would be tarnished, with two vice-presidents disappearing under similar circumstances.
Haruki missed everything from her time—her strict parents, her best friends, her club. She missed the life she had left behind, even if it hadn’t been perfect.
Her gaze drifted to the door opposite her—the one she had come through. Beyond that door was the present, the 2000s, her real home. She got up from the table and walked over to it, her heart pounding. She grabbed the handle and tried to pry it open, but it wouldn’t budge. She nudged it, then forced it, slamming her body against it in desperation. But the door remained firmly shut, and all she succeeded in doing was hurting her shoulders and knocking over the items on the nearby shelves.
Haruki sat on the floor, rubbing her sore shoulders and wincing in pain. As she caught her breath, she noticed something among the scattered items—a leather-bound book. It was red with brass edges, and its pages had fallen open to a specific spread. Haruki picked it up, her curiosity piqued.
On the left page was an illustration of the door before her, the sketch eerily accurate. The details were precise, from the grain of the wood to the brass handle. It was as if someone had drawn it from life.
On the right page was a poem, its text surrounded by intricate illustrations and decorations that looked medieval—far older than the time she was currently in. The words were written in an elegant script, and they read:
“When the sun meets the moon
When the dark meets the light
When the evil meets the good
When the man meets the lady
The gate shall open.”
Haruki stared at the page, her mind racing. At first, she thought it was just a vintage book, perhaps something the previous owner of the cottage had collected. But the illustration of the door and the cryptic poem made her wonder if there was more to it. Was this a clue? A way back to her own time?
She closed the book and placed it back on the shelf, her thoughts a jumbled mess. She was too tired to make sense of it now. All she wanted was to sleep and process the bizarre day she had just experienced.
Haruki walked to the small room with the iron-frame bed and lay down, her body sinking into the thin mattress. She stared at the ceiling, her mind still racing, but exhaustion soon overtook her. As she drifted off to sleep, the words of the poem echoed in her mind, a faint glimmer of hope amidst the chaos.

            <Title>Chapter 11 RAW</Title>
            <Text>After the final bell rang, signaling the end of the school day, Haruki and Honoka walked together through the hallway, their footsteps blending with the chatter of other students. The air was filled with the sound of laughter and the shuffling of shoes as everyone made their way to the exits.
Haruki glanced at Honoka, her hands clutching the straps of her bag. “Aoki-san,” she began, her tone hesitant, “I-is the class usually this strict?”
Honoka looked at her, her brow furrowing in confusion. “Strict? I thought it was pretty laid back today. Why? Was it different at your previous school?”
Haruki hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. “Well… yeah,” she said carefully. “At my old school, the teachers were usually pretty relaxed. Sometimes, we could even talk to them like friends. But here…” She trailed off, glancing around the hallway as if expecting Mr. Genzo to appear with his wooden ruler at any moment. “It feels like I could get hit with a ruler for just breathing wrong.”
Honoka giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. “You’re funny, Fujiyama-san. Are you from the city or something? I’ve heard the schools there are a lot more laid back.”
Haruki blinked, caught off guard by the question. She couldn’t exactly tell Honoka that she was from the same town, just fifty years in the future. So, she nodded, going along with the assumption. “Yeah, I’m from the city. It’s… different there.”
Honoka’s eyes sparkled with curiosity. “That sounds exciting. I’ve always wanted to visit the city. Maybe one day I will.”
Haruki smiled faintly, though her heart ached at the thought. She knew what the future held for Honoka—a life tied to tradition and expectations, far removed from the dreams she might have now.
Honoka tilted her head, studying Haruki for a moment. “You know, if it helps you relax a bit, you can just call me Honoka.”
Haruki’s eyes widened in surprise. “A-are you sure?”
Honoka nodded, her smile warm and genuine. “Of course. We’re classmates now, after all.”
Haruki hesitated, then nodded. “Alright then, Honoka-san,” she said, testing the name on her tongue. “Then please call me Haruki.”
Honoka’s smile widened. “Okay then, Haruki-chan.”
The nickname caught Haruki off guard, sending a warm, familiar feeling through her chest. She hadn’t been called that in a long time. In the present, her mother always addressed her formally, her tone strict and distant. But here, Honoka’s voice was friendly and down-to-earth, filled with a warmth that felt both familiar and alien at the same time.
It was strange, hearing her mother—her young mother—call her by such an affectionate name. It made her feel at home, yet also reminded her of how much had changed over the years. How much she had changed.
As they walked through the bustling hallway, Honoka turned to Haruki with a bright smile. “By the way, Haruki-chan,” she said, her tone casual but enthusiastic, “I’m the editor of the Literature Club. If you haven’t joined any clubs yet, you should consider joining mine. We’re always looking for someone to help out with the papers!”
Haruki hesitated, her mind racing. The Literature Club. It wasn’t the Art Club she had loved so much in her own time, but it was something. Still, after everything that had happened today, she felt exhausted—mentally and emotionally. She needed time to process everything.
“Thank you, Honoka-san,” Haruki said, forcing a small smile. “I’ll think about it. But today… I think I just need to rest. It’s been quite a day.”
Honoka nodded, her expression understanding. “Of course. You’ve had a lot to adjust to. Take your time.”
They continued walking, the chatter of other students fading as they neared the school gates. Honoka glanced at Haruki, her curiosity getting the better of her. “So, where do you live, Haruki-chan? Maybe we’re neighbors!”
Haruki’s heart skipped a beat. She hadn’t thought about this. Her house—the grand, traditional estate she knew in the present—didn’t exist yet. The only place she could call home in this time was the small, abandoned house in the forest where she had taken shelter the night before. She needed to come up with something believable.
“I, uh… live in a cabin in the forest,” Haruki said, her voice hesitant. “With my grandfather.”
Honoka’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really? That’s so interesting! I didn’t know there were cabins out there. I live not far from the forest, actually. My family’s house is just a short walk away.”
Haruki’s mind raced. That’s right—her grandparents’ house on her mother’s side was somewhere near the forest. She had heard stories about it from her mother, though she had never seen it herself. The realization made her chest tighten with a strange mix of emotions.
“Oh,” Haruki said, her voice soft. “That’s… convenient.”
Honoka smiled, her expression warm. “If you’re heading home now, we could walk together. It’s always nicer to have company, don’t you think?”
Haruki hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Sure. That sounds nice.”
They stepped out of the school gates, the cool afternoon air brushing against their faces. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the town. As they walked, Honoka chatted easily, telling Haruki about her family, her favorite books, and the Literature Club’s upcoming activities. Haruki listened, her heart swelling with a mix of emotions—nostalgia, sadness, and a strange, aching hope.
As they walked toward the gate, Haruki noticed a group of students gathered nearby. The motorcycle gang from earlier was hanging out, their bikes parked in a neat row. Nagano sat on the edge of the sidewalk, an acoustic guitar resting on his lap. His fingers moved skillfully over the strings, playing a familiar tune—Ue o Muite Arukō—while his friends sang along, their voices loud and slightly off-key.
“Hey, it’s Haruki-chan!” Nagano called, spotting her as she approached. He grinned, his fingers still strumming the guitar. “Come join us!”
Haruki smiled, her heart lifting at the sight. She turned to Honoka, who was standing beside her, her face suddenly flushed and her hands fidgeting nervously. “Hey, it’s Nagano over there,” Haruki said, her tone cheerful. “Let’s go say hi!”
“H-Haruki?” Honoka stammered, her voice barely above a whisper. Her cheeks turned bright red, and she looked like she wanted to disappear. But before she could protest, Haruki grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the group.
Nagano’s grin widened as they approached. “Hey, Haruki-chan! And… oh, it’s Aoki-san!” he said, his tone teasing. “What brings you two here?”
Honoka’s face turned even redder, and she looked down at her feet, unable to meet Nagano’s gaze. “I-I was just walking home with Fujiyama-san,” she mumbled, her voice barely audible.
Haruki, on the other hand, was unfazed. She let go of Honoka’s hand and sat down on the sidewalk, leaning back on her palms. “We heard you playing and thought we’d come over,” she said, her tone casual. “You’re pretty good, Nagano.”
Nagano laughed, his fingers still moving over the guitar strings. “Thanks! I’ve been practicing. You know this song?”
Haruki nodded. “Yeah, it’s Ue o Muite Arukō, right? It’s a a vintage classic.”
Nagano’s fingers faltered for a moment, and he looked at her with a puzzled expression. “Vintage? What are you talking about? This song just came out last year. It’s a global hit right now—everyone even people in America is listening to it.”
Haruki froze, her cheeks flushing as she realized her mistake. Of course. She wasn’t in the present anymore. This song wasn’t a nostalgic throwback here—it was brand new, fresh and popular. And her parents—well, the younger versions of them sitting right here—were part of the generation that had made it a hit.
“Oh, right,” Haruki said quickly, trying to cover her slip. “I mean, it’s just so good that it feels like a classic already.”
“I know, right?”, He grinned, and started playing again. “Well, if you like it that much, maybe I’ll play it more often.”
Haruki smiled weakly, her mind racing. She couldn’t help but think about her father in the present, how he would play this song on his old tape recorder whenever he was relaxing by himself. She had always thought it was just a random habit, but now she realized—this was where it had started. This song, this moment, was the origin of that tradition.
Honoka, still standing awkwardly to the side, finally found her voice. “I-It’s… it’s a beautiful song,” she said softly, her eyes flickering toward Nagano before quickly looking away.
Nagano smiled at her, his expression softening. “Thanks, Aoki-san. You should sit down and sing with us. We’re just hanging out before heading home.”
Honoka hesitated, her face still flushed, but Haruki reached up and tugged on her sleeve. “Come on, Honoka-san. Sit down. It’ll be fun.”
Reluctantly, Honoka sat down beside Haruki, her hands folded neatly in her lap. Nagano continued playing, his friends joining in with the singing. The atmosphere was lively and carefree, a stark contrast to the strict, formal environment of the school.
As the music filled the air, Haruki couldn’t help but smile. For the first time since arriving in this strange, unfamiliar world, she felt a sense of belonging. She glanced at Honoka, who was still blushing but seemed to be enjoying herself, and then at Nagano, who was completely absorbed in his music.
This was her parents’ past—a time before the weight of expectations and responsibilities had shaped them into the people she knew. And for now, she was a part of it.

-o-

As Haruki and Honoka continued their walk home, the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the rice fields that stretched out on either side of the road. The air was filled with the chirping of crickets and the occasional rustle of the wind through the tall grass. It was peaceful, but Honoka’s mood was anything but.
She walked a few steps ahead of Haruki, her arms crossed and her lips pressed into a pout. Her shoulders were hunched, and every now and then, she let out a small, frustrated sigh. Haruki watched her with amusement, recognizing the sulky demeanor all too well. It was so much like her mother in the present—stubborn, dramatic, and impossible to ignore.
“Honoka-san,” Haruki said, her tone light and teasing. “What’s the matter? You’ve been sulking the whole way.”
Honoka mumbled something under her breath, her voice barely audible.
“What was that?” Haruki asked, leaning closer.
“I said,” Honoka repeated, her voice louder but still tinged with annoyance, “You should’ve given me a heads-up before dragging me over there like that.”
Haruki blinked, surprised by the response. “A heads-up? About what?”
Honoka stopped walking and turned to face Haruki, her cheeks flushed and her eyes narrowed. “About Nagano and his friends, obviously! You just pulled me over without warning, and I wasn’t ready!”
Haruki stared at her for a moment, then burst out laughing. The way Honoka sulked and grumbled, her mannerisms and tone—it was so reminiscent of her present-day mother. It took Haruki a second to realize what was happening, but when it clicked, she couldn’t stop grinning.
“Oh, I see,” Haruki said, her voice dripping with mock seriousness. “It’s about Nagano-kun, isn’t it?”
Honoka’s face turned bright red, and she sputtered, “Wh-what? Where did that come from?!”
Haruki smirked, crossing her arms. “Come on, Honoka-san! It’s obvious!”
“Sh-shh!” Honoka hissed, lunging forward and clapping a hand over Haruki’s mouth. She glanced around nervously, her eyes scanning the empty road and the vast rice fields around them. Satisfied that no one was nearby, she slowly removed her hand and let out a long sigh.
“You’re impossible,” Honoka muttered, her cheeks still flushed. She hesitated for a moment, then sighed again, her shoulders slumping. “Fine. I trust you, Haruki-chan. So… I’ll tell you.”
Haruki raised an eyebrow, trying to suppress a smile. “Tell me what?”
Honoka looked down at her feet, her voice barely above a whisper. “I… I like Nagano-kun.”
There was a beat of silence. Haruki’s expression didn’t change—it remained deadpan, almost unreadable—but a small, involuntary chuckle escaped her lips. The absurdity of the situation hit her all at once. Here she was, standing in the middle of a rice field in 1961, listening to her teenage mother confess her crush on her teenage father. It was like something out of a surreal comedy.
Honoka’s eyes widened, and she stared at Haruki, her confusion evident. “W-what is that reaction?” she asked, her voice rising in panic. “Is it that obvious?”
Haruki’s lips twitched again, but she managed to keep her expression mostly neutral. “Oh, no, no,” she said, her tone dripping with mock seriousness. “It’s not obvious at all. I’m just… processing.”
Honoka frowned, clearly not buying it. “Processing? What does that even mean?”
Haruki shrugged, her deadpan expression finally breaking into a small grin. “It means you’re not as subtle as you think, Honoka-san.”
Honoka groaned, covering her face with her hands. “This is a disaster.”
Haruki reached out and gently pulled Honoka’s hands away from her face. “Hey, it’s not a disaster. It’s cute. And honestly, I think Nagano-kun likes you too.”
Honoka’s expression shifted, her earlier flustered demeanor giving way to something more somber. She took her hands away from her face, her voice quiet but firm. “No, he doesn’t.”
“Didn’t you see how popular he is?” Honoka continued, “He’s surrounded by all those popular boys, and the girls in class—no, the entire school—are always talking about him. About how cool he is, about the rumors of him defying the principal, how he avoids punishments and not being scared by it.”
Haruki blinked, surprised by the sudden shift in Honoka’s mood. 
“I’m just an editor for the school press in the Literature Club,” Honoka continued, her voice trembling slightly. “I’m not popular. In fact, my name isn’t even written in the school press. No one notices me unless they need something proofread. You’re the only one who actually talks to me and doesn’t think my rambling about books and literature is boring.” She looked down at her feet, her shoulders slumping. “What chance do I have with someone like Nagano-kun?”
Haruki’s heart ached at the raw vulnerability in Honoka’s voice. She had always known her mother as a strong, confident woman in the present, but here, in this time, Honoka was just a teenager, grappling with insecurities and self-doubt. It was a side of her mother she had never seen before, and it made her feel both protective and sad.
“Honoka-san,” Haruki said gently, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You’re amazing. You’re smart, kind, and passionate about what you love. That’s not something everyone has. And Nagano-kun… he’s not as untouchable as you think. He’s just a guy who likes music, motorcycles and hanging out with his friends. Trust me, he’d be lucky to have someone like you.”
Honoka looked up at Haruki, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. For a moment, it seemed like she wanted to believe her, but then she shook her head again. “It doesn’t matter. Even if he did like me, it wouldn’t change anything. I’m not… I’m not the kind of girl he would even notice.”
Haruki opened her mouth to argue, 
But Honoka cut her off. “Please, Haruki-chan,” she said, her voice pleading. “Just… keep this a secret, okay? I don’t want it to turn into some rumor. I don’t want to be laughed at.”
Haruki hesitated, then nodded. “Okay,” she said softly. “I won’t tell anyone. But just know that you’re worth more than you think, Honoka-san. And someday, someone’s going to see that. Maybe even Nagano-kun.”
Honoka gave her a small, grateful smile, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Thanks, Haruki-chan. You’re a good friend.”
They continued walking in silence, the weight of Honoka’s confession hanging in the air. Haruki couldn’t help but feel a mix of emotions—sadness for Honoka’s insecurities, frustration at the unfairness of it all, and a fierce determination to help her mother see her own worth.
For the first time since arriving in this strange, unfamiliar world, Haruki felt a flicker of connection. She didn’t know how long she would be here, or what the future held, but for now, she was grateful for this moment. For the chance to see her mother as she truly was—not as the stern, distant figure Haruki knew, but as the kind, vibrant girl walking beside her.
As they approached the edge of the forest, Honoka pointed down a narrow path. “My house is just down that way,” she said. “Where’s your cabin, Haruki-chan?”
Haruki glanced toward the dense trees, her heart pounding. “It’s… a little further in,” she said, her voice quiet. “I’ll be fine from here. Thanks for walking with me, Honoka-san.”
Honoka smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “Of course! See you tomorrow, Haruki-chan.”
Haruki watched as Honoka walked away, her figure growing smaller as she disappeared down the path. For a moment, Haruki stood there, her chest tight with emotion. Then, she turned and made her way into the forest, her footsteps slow and deliberate.
The small, abandoned house came into view, its silhouette stark against the fading light. Haruki stepped inside, the air cool and still. She sat down on the floor, her back against the wall, and closed her eyes.
She didn’t know how she had ended up here, or why, but one thing was clear: she had been given a chance to see her parents as they truly were—not as the stern, distant figures she knew, but as the people they had been before life had shaped them.
And maybe, just maybe, she could change things. For them. For herself.
</Text>
            <Notes>Haruki talks to Honoka and asked whether the class is usually this strict, and Honoka was confused because Honoka thought the class is pretty laid back, Honoka then proceeds to ask whether is it more laid back in Haruki’s previous school

Haruki then proceed to tell about her “previous school”, and there the teachers are usually pretty laid back, the students can talk to the teachers sometimes as a friend, whilst here it seemed like she could be hit by a wooden ruler by any time

Honoka giggled, asking whether Haruki is from the city, Haruki couldn’t find any other explanation for it, so she just goes with it

“Alright then, if it could help you relax a bit, you can just call me Honoka.”

“Are you sure?”

Honoka nodded

“Alright then, Honoka-san.” Haruki said, “Then please call me Haruki.”

“Okay then, Haruki-chan.”

Haruki talks to Honoka, and Honoka revealed that she is the president of the Literature club, and if she haven’t got any clubs in mind, she can join hers.

Haruki considered the offer but she excused herself because she wants to get some rest today, it’s been quite a day

Honoka understood, and then asked where did she live.

Haruki took a moment, trying to construct a lie, where did she live? Technically her house hadn’t existed, the only thing she can call home is the small house with two set of doors in the forest. So she just said that she live by the forest in a cabin with her grandfather

Honoka then said that she lived not far from there, and they could walk home together, 

that’s right, Haruki thought, her grandparent’s house from her mother’s side lived somewhere close by the forest, and so Haruki nodded, and they goes home together


Nagano called Haruki, and they hung out, but Honoka was very shy. </Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 1 RAW V2-1</Title>
            <Text>The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, somewhere across the school yard, practicing.
The distant screeching of shoes, the rhytmic thudding of basketball being bounced at the gymnasium below.
The rhythmic scratching of a paintbrush against canvas filled the small room, each stroke deliberate, each movement lost in the rhythm of creation. 
The room smelled of acrylics and turpentine, a scent that Haruki had come to associate with freedom—a freedom she rarely felt outside these four walls.
In the center of the room stood a girl, her figure silhouetted by the golden light of the setting sun streaming through the window. Haruki Fujiyama, her dark hair tied loosely in a ponytail, stood before an easel, her paintbrush moving almost instinctively across the canvas. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, her lips pressed into a thin line as she lost herself in the world she was creating. 
To anyone watching, it might have seemed like she was painting a landscape or a portrait, but to Haruki, it was something more. It was a world—a world where the colors bled into each other like emotions, where the lines blurred between reality and imagination. A world where she could be anything.
She stepped back for a moment, tilting her head as she studied her work. The painting was abstract, a swirl of blues and purples with streaks of gold cutting through like sunlight breaking through a storm. It wasn’t perfect—nothing ever was—but it was hers. 
For a fleeting moment, she wondered if such a place could exist. A place where she didn’t have to argue with her father about art school, where her mother didn’t gently suggest she consider a “more practical” career. A place where she could just be, without the weight of expectations pressing down on her shoulders.
Her brush hovered over the canvas as her thoughts drifted. What would it be like to live in a world where her dreams weren’t just dreams? Where she could paint all day, every day, and no one would tell her it was a waste of time? Where her father’s stern face would soften with pride instead of disappointment? She sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. Maybe such a world only existed in her paintings. Maybe it was foolish to hope for anything more.
Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, the door behind her creaked open, pulling her back to reality. The sound of footsteps and the faint jingle of a charm bracelet broke the silence.
“Honoka-chan!” a sing-songy voice called out, bright and cheerful. “There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”
Honoka didn’t hear her at first. Her mind was still lost in the world of the book in front of her, far removed from the Editorial room. She was thinking about the stanzas—what does the author mean, how they should interact with the other stanzas to produce deeper meaning. Why does this author used this word? Did the words mean something deeper? She murmured to herself, her pencil scribbled uncertainly over the notebook as her finger traces the pages. “Maybe if I try to use this word instead…”Haruki didn’t hear her at first. Her mind was still lost in the world of the book in front of her, far removed from the Editorial room. She was thinking about the stanzas—what does the author mean, how they should interact with the other stanzas to produce deeper meaning. Why does this author used this word? Did the words mean something deeper? She murmured to herself, her pencil scribbled uncertainly over the notebook as her finger traces the pages. “Maybe if I try to use this word instead…”
The girl, standing by the door with her hands on her hips, frowned when Honoka didn’t respond.
“Honoka-chan!” she called again, louder this time. Still, Honoka didn’t turn.
“Aw come on!” The girl groaned, “Are you still angry at me?”
Quietly, the girl tiptoed across the room, her sneakers making no sound on the wooden floor. She crept up behind Honoka, her hands poised to strike.
Then, with a dramatic flourish, she clapped her hands on Honoka’s shoulders and shouted, “Boo!”
Honoka was surprised, she jolted so violently that her chair tipped backward. Her arms flailed.
Books, parchments, loose papers exploded into the air, cascading down like confetti in a parade of overwork. Her body caught on an open book—and she tumbled off her chair entirely, landing flat on her back with a heavy thud.
“H-haruki?!” she exclaimed, spinning around to glare at her friend. “What was that for?!”
Haruki burst into laughter, doubling over as Honoka scowled. “You should’ve seen your face!” she wheezed, clutching her stomach. “Priceless!”
Akihito let out another sigh and shook his head. “You’re impossible,” he muttered, walking over to inspect the damage. “And now she has to fix that.”
Haruki groaned, turning back to her painting. “Ugh, Aiko! This was almost done!”
“Relax, relax! You can totally turn that into, uh…” Aiko squinted at the streak. “A tree branch? A shadow? A really abstract emotion?”
Akihito pinched the bridge of his nose. “Or you could just not ruin her work in the first place, Aiko.”
Haruki sighed, rubbing her temple. “You two are exhausting.”
“See?” Aiko grinned, nudging Akihito. “She means you too.”
Akihito simply crossed his arms. “At least I’m not the one causing her problems.”
Haruki shook her head, but despite herself, a small smile tugged at her lips. The three of them were an odd balance—Aiko’s chaos, Akihito’s restraint, and her own quiet focus—but somehow, it worked.
“Yeah, yeah,” Aiko said, still giggling. She stepped closer, peering over Haruki’s shoulder at the painting. “Whatcha painting there, Picasso?”
Haruki didn’t look up, her focus returning to the canvas. “Komorebi,” she said simply. “I need practice painting light.”
Aiko tilted her head, studying the painting. It was a tree, its leaves dappled with sunlight that seemed to shimmer even in its unfinished state. “Whoa, that’s awesome!” she said, her voice dripping with mock enthusiasm. “Is the light going to be brighter than your future?”
“Don’t be silly. It’s just a painting.” Haruki chuckled despite herself, shaking her head. “Why the weird question?”
Before Aiko could answer, Akihito cleared his throat from where he stood, arms crossed. “Speaking of your future,” he said, his tone even but pointed, “you still haven’t filled out your Career Plans paper.”
“Mrs. Kitagawa has been asking about it all day. You’re one of the last people who haven’t submitted it.” He reached into his neatly organized bag and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. “You left this at your desk this morning.”
Haruki’s smile faltered as she looked at the paper. “Oh, yeah,” she said quietly, setting down her painting knife. She peeled off her paint-stained gloves and apron, then took the paper from Aiko. The words “Career Plans” were printed in bold letters at the top, and the sight of them made her stomach twist.
“So, have you thought of any?” Aiko asked, leaning casually against the table. Her tone was light, but her eyes were curious, searching Haruki’s face for an answer.
Haruki sighed, setting the Career Plans paper down on the table. “No… I’m not sure.”
Akihito, who had been re-organising his bag, glanced up. “What about Tokyo University?” he suggested. “You’re one of our best painters in the Art Club. Their fine arts program is one of the best. My older brother goes there to study computer science, he says the professors are amazing, and their alumni do well in the industry.”
Haruki hesitated, her fingers tightening around her paintbrush. 
Aiko perked up at the idea. “Ohhh, that’s a great idea! You’d totally get in,” she said, nudging Haruki with her elbow.
But instead of excitement, Haruki’s shoulders slumped. She turned back to her painting, brushing light strokes onto the canvas as if to distract herself. “You know my dad,” she murmured. “He’d rather I become a doctor or something ‘respectable’ than go there.”
Akihito frowned slightly but didn’t push. Aiko, on the other hand, scoffed. “Pfft, respectable? As if painting isn’t just as important!”
Akihito gave her a pointed look. “That’s not how the world works, Aiko.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Aiko waved him off before turning back to Haruki. “But seriously, Haru-chan, don’t let your dad kill your dreams.”
Haruki swallowed, eyes lingering on the painting in front of her. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Maybe it’s not a dream if I can’t even say it out loud.”
Aiko frowned, crossing her arms. “Why not? Didn’t one of the seniors from Art Club go there?” She tapped her chin, trying to remember. “I think she used to be the vice president of the Art Club back when we were first-years.”
Haruki paused, her brush hovering over the canvas. “Matsuda-senpai?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Yeah! Yaeko Matsuda!” Aiko said, snapping her fingers. “Her paintings were gorgeous. Didn’t she go to Tokyo University to pursue fine arts?”
“Aiko… Didn’t you know?” Akihito said, “She never enrolled.”
“Wait,” Haruki swiftly turned to him, for a second, she abandoned her painting to fully turn towards them. “What do you mean?”
“Although my brother didn’t study fine arts there, he is studying computer science,” Akihito explained. “I asked him about Matsuda-senpai once, just out of curiosity. But when he checked, she wasn’t on any student lists. None of the professors had heard of her, and even the students she was supposed to be friends with had no idea where she went.”
Haruki fell silent, her expression darkening. The room seemed to grow colder, the cheerful chatter of the brass band outside, the rhytmic thudding, screeching and cheer from the gymnasium below fading into the background. She set her brush down and turned fully to face him.
Aiko blinked, confused. “Wait… so what are you saying?”
Akihito exhaled, folding his arms. “I don’t know. Just that she disappeared before graduation, and nobody—not her classmates, not even her close friends—knows where she went.”
Aiko’s playful demeanor flickered, replaced by unease. “Are you implying that she—?”
Haruki didn’t answer right away. Her fingers tightened around the brush in her hand. Disappeared? That couldn’t be right.
Her gaze drifted past Akihito and Aiko, toward the wall of polaroid photos behind them. The Art Club’s memories, snapshots of their weekly plein-air painting sessions, their shared laughter, the occasional paint-smudged chaos. Her eyes scanned over familiar faces, frozen mid-laughter, mid-brushstroke, before landing on one particular photo.
Yaeko Matsuda.
Her hair was tied in a neat braid, round glasses perched on her nose, a gentle yet confident smile on her face. Below the picture, scrawled in thick marker, were the words: Fight on, Vice President Matsuda!
Haruki’s throat tightened. Back when she was a first-year, she had looked up to Matsuda more than anyone. It was Matsuda who had trusted her, who had passed on the role of Vice President before her graduation. Haruki had always believed that Matsuda was out there, pursuing her dreams, painting, creating—just as she had always encouraged Haruki to do.
But what if she never made it?
 “No…” Haruki swallowed, her fingers loosening from the brush. “That can’t be right.”
She tore her gaze away from the photo, but the weight in her chest remained. The room felt colder, the usual warmth of the Art Club replaced with something hollow and uncertain.
For a moment, none of them spoke. The distant sound of the brass band outside felt oddly out of place, as if the world beyond their quiet art room had no idea that a mystery had just settled in the space between them.
Then, Akihito exhaled and ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry,” he said, offering a sheepish smile. “I didn’t mean to make the room feel like a horror story.” He leaned back against the table, glancing between them. “It’s probably just a rumor, anyway. A big university like Tokyo? My brother might’ve just had bad luck trying to find her.”
Haruki let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. The tension eased, if only slightly. “Yeah… maybe,” she murmured.
Aiko, sensing the shift, clapped her hands together. “Alright! Enough ghost stories before sunset.” She stretched, her usual energy returning, though there was still a flicker of unease in her eyes.
Haruki forced a small smile. “I’ll tidy up for a bit, then I’ll meet you at the bicycle park.”
“Got it!” Aiko chirped, her usual sing-songy voice back in full force. But as she turned to leave, she paused at the doorframe, glancing back at Haruki. “Hey, Haruki-chan.”
Haruki raised an eyebrow. “Hmm?”
Aiko grinned. “Have you thought of any career path, just off the top of your head?”
Haruki tilted her head. “Off the top of my head—?”
“Quick! Answer, no time!” Aiko teased, rocking on her heels.
Haruki hesitated for a moment, then smiled. “Art school,” she said firmly. “That’s what’s on the top of my head.”
Aiko’s smile widened, and she gave Haruki a thumbs-up. “Then write it on your paper and submit it before Mrs. Kitagawa continues nagging me about it!”
Haruki laughed, the last remnants of tension finally lifting. “I will, I will. Now go on, I’ll catch up.”
As Aiko disappeared down the hallway, her footsteps echoing faintly, Haruki turned back to her painting. The komorebi—the sunlight filtering through the leaves—seemed to glow brighter now, as if reflecting the spark of determination in her heart. She dipped her brush into the thinner, cleaning it carefully before putting everything in its place. </Text>

            <Title>Chapter 21 RAW</Title>
            <Text>Haruki helped Honoka tidy up the fallen books, stacking loose papers and student submissions neatly on the desk. The silence between them was comfortable now, filled only with the rustle of paper and the occasional creak of the old wooden floor.
Then, out of the blue, Honoka spoke, her voice soft but clear.
&quot;I'm sorry for how I acted yesterday.&quot;
Haruki paused, a stack of papers in her hands. &quot;What for?&quot;
Honoka kept her eyes on the book in front of her, her fingers tracing the edge of the page. &quot;I got angry at you. I shouldn’t have. I know you and Nagano-kun are just friends—you two just hang out in the same group. Maybe I was just... insecure. I could never be as free and outgoing as you and him.&quot;
Haruki frowned, setting the papers down. &quot;But why?&quot;
Honoka exhaled, her shoulders slumping slightly. &quot;Well... my parents never wanted me to play around like other kids. No sleepovers, no after-school hangouts. Just study, study, study, study.” Her voice sounds bitter, before she continued.

“—so I can become a teacher one day.&quot;
The words hit Haruki like a punch to the gut. Because she did become a teacher. The Honoka she knew in the future—her mother—had followed that exact path.
She stared at the paper in her hands - an essay on The Tale of Genji - seeing not the words but her memory of mother in the present time, in her own time. Grading papers at the kitchen table late into the night, feeling restless and sleepy, fuelled by coffee and stress. 
&quot;But you said you wanted to be a poet,&quot; Haruki said carefully, picking up another stray sheet. &quot;You’ve written that poetry book and everything.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but...&quot; Honoka smiled faintly, still not looking up. &quot;It’s just a hobby, you know? Something for myself. Publishing is expensive, and the thousands of rejections is a going to take so much time… And my parents don’t want any of that uncertainty, they want me to have a stable career.” She said, scribbling of graphite could be heard as she talks.
“I’m just glad they allowed me join the Literature Club at all. Knowing how strict they are.&quot;
She set down her pen, finally meeting Haruki’s gaze. &quot;I envy you and Nagano. You both seem like you have all the time in the world—riding around Japan on his bike, doing whatever you want on weekends.”
“Meanwhile, I’m stuck at home studying Souseki, Shikibu, Kawabata, Mishima… Knowing that I wouldn’t be able to make something of my own to show the world.&quot;
The air between them grew heavy. Haruki remembered with sudden clarity that night in her home, that didn’t exist in this time - the dining table where her father had calmly placed the nursery school application. The way her mother's hands had fluttered nervously pouring tea as Haruki's voice rose in protest.
The slam of her palm against the dining room table. The bitter taste of green tea gone cold in her mouth. The way her mother had reached for her wrist as she stormed toward the front door - that desperate grip she'd shaken off so violently she heard her mother stumble.
Rain had been falling that night. She remembered how it soaked through her sneakers as she ran blindly down the lamp-lit street, how she'd screamed into the storm that they were just like all the same - crushing dreams beneath obligation. That they didn't understand art mattered more than some safe career. That why she lived mattered more than how she lived.
Now, watching Honoka's fingers trace the edges of her poetry notebook with the same restrained longing, Haruki understood the truth: her mother hadn't been the enemy that night. She'd been someone who recognized the shape of the cage because she'd lived in one herself.
Haruki moved behind Honoka's chair and wrapped her arms around her friend's shoulders in a tight embrace.
&quot;H-Haruki? What are you—&quot; Honoka stiffened in surprise, her hands hovering uncertainly.
&quot;I'm sorry...&quot; Haruki whispered, pressing her forehead against Honoka's shoulder blade. The scent of ink and faint floral shampoo filled her nose - so familiar, so much like home.
Honoka relaxed slightly, though confusion still laced her voice. &quot;It's okay, Haruki-chan.&quot; She patted Haruki's arm awkwardly. 
&quot;I can still write poetry in my spare time!&quot; She continued, forcing cheer in her tone only made Haruki hold on tighter. &quot;I guess Nagano has it good, doesn't he? To be able to hang out with his friends whenever he wishes, come home as late as he wants...&quot;
Haruki's grip loosened as she drew back slightly. The golden light caught the dust motes swirling between them as she took a deep breath.
&quot;But...&quot; she said quietly, moving to sit beside Honoka, &quot;Nagano isn't that free either.&quot;
Honoka blinked, leaning back in her chair. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;His father owns an automotive company,&quot; Haruki said matter-of-factly. &quot;And his father before him probably did too. It’s obvious he’s expected to inherit it.&quot;
Honoka’s smile turned wistful. &quot;That’s nice.&quot;
&quot;But he doesn’t want that,&quot; Haruki insisted. &quot;He loves music—singing, playing guitar, performing. You know he’s terrible at math and physics. He hates engineering.&quot;
Honoka’s expression softened. &quot;But… he still has to inherit the business nonetheless.&quot;
Haruki nodded. &quot;He still has to go to engineering school after graduation. He’ll have to give up on music.&quot;
A heavy silence settled between them, the weight of unspoken dreams pressing down. Honoka stared at her notebook, her fingers absently tracing the spine. 
The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, somewhere across the school yard, practicing.
The distant screeching of shoes, the rhytmic thudding of basketball being bounced at the gymnasium below.
The rhythmic scratching of a pencil against notebook, the crunching of pages being flipped. filled the small room, each scratch deliberate, each movement lost in the rhythm of creation. 
The room smelled of old ink and pages, a scent that Haruki thought, Honoka had come to associate with freedom—a freedom she rarely felt outside these four walls.
&quot;But you still love him, don't you, Honoka?&quot;
Honoka's pencil stilled. Her breath caught, and for a moment, she considered denying it—again. But the words died before they could form. There was no hiding it anymore. Not from Haruki. Not from herself.
&quot;Yeah...&quot; she admitted at last, a small, helpless smile tugging at her lips. &quot;I do.&quot;
Haruki's face lit up like the sun breaking through clouds. &quot;That's why,&quot; she declared, throwing her arms wide with a flourish, &quot;We're going to make his dream come true!&quot;</Text>
            <Notes>that is nice, now onto the next scene

Haruki helped Honoka tidy up the books that had fallen to the floor, collecting loose papers and student submissions and stacking it neatly into her desk, as Honoka continued her study of old literatures, Haruki helped her by cleaning her own mess, the silence is comforting.

&quot;I'm sorry for how i acted yesterday.&quot; Honoka said out of the blue, her voice is soft, 

&quot;What for?&quot; Haruki asked,

&quot;I got angry at you yesterday,&quot; Honoka said, &quot;I shouldn't. I know you and Nagano-kun were only friends, you two just played in the same friends group, maybe i was too insecure, you know? I could never be as free and as easily outgoing like you and Nagano.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot; Haruki asked, as she collected a pile of loose paper,

&quot;Well,&quot; She said, &quot;My parents would never wanted me to play with others, get into sleepovers and the like... They always wanted me to study, so i can become a teacher one day.&quot;

This hits Haruki hard, because she knew, her mother in the present timeline is a teacher, so she is right

&quot;But you said you wanted to be a poet, right? you've wrote that poetry book and all.&quot; Haruki said

&quot;Yeah, but...&quot; Honoka said as she continues writing, &quot;It was just a hobby. you know? something for myself to enjoy... publishing is a difficult and costs so much money, and my parents wants me to have a stable career one day, im still glad they still allowed me in the Literature club.&quot;

&quot;I kind of envy both of you...&quot; Honoka continued, &quot;You and Nagano seems like have a time in the world, able to travel all across Japan in his bike in your weekends. While Im stuck in my home studying Literatures.”

Haruki stayed silent, “But you know… Nagano isn’t that free either.”

Honoka turned her head, leaning to the back of her chair to face Haruki, “What do you mean?”

“Well, his father owned an automotive company,” Haruki said matter-of-factly, “And probably his father before him too, so it’s obviously his duty to inherit the company.”

Honoka smiled envily, “That’s nice.”

“But he doesn’t want that.” Haruki said, “He has a passion in music, he like singing, playing the guitar and performing music. He is bad at mathemathics and physics, obviously he hate Engineering.”
“But he still need to inherit the family business.” Honoka contined

Haruki nodded, “He still need to go to Engineering School after graduation, he will have to abandon his music.”

There is a silence between them, 

The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, somewhere across the school yard, practicing.
The distant screeching of shoes, the rhytmic thudding of basketball being bounced at the gymnasium below.
The rhythmic scratching of a pencil against notebook, the crunching of pages being flipped. filled the small room, each scratch deliberate, each movement lost in the rhythm of creation. 
The room smelled of old ink and pages, a scent that Honoka had come to associate with freedom—a freedom she rarely felt outside these four walls.

“But you still love him, didn’t you, Honoka?” Haruki asked

“No I-“ Honoka said, then stopped herself, there is no hiding it anymore, “Yeah…” Honoka admitted, smile start to tug on her lips “I do…”

“That is why…” Haruki said with a fluorish, “We are going to make his dream come true!”

            <Text>Nagano

This additional information about Nagano adds so much depth to his character and the story! The contrast between the stern, resentful CEO in the present and the rebellious, music-loving teenager in the past creates a compelling arc for both Nagano and Haruhi. It also reinforces the themes of lost dreams, generational expectations, and the tension between duty and passion. Let’s dive deeper into how this backstory can shape the narrative and Haruhi’s journey.

Nagano’s Character Arc
Present Nagano
Personality: Stern, efficient, and resentful. He’s a man who has buried his dreams under layers of responsibility and societal expectations.
Appearance: A tall, imposing figure with graying hair, always dressed in sharp suits. His eyes carry a hint of sadness, though he rarely shows it.
Conflict: He’s strict with Haruhi because he doesn’t want her to make the same “mistakes” he did—chasing dreams that lead to disappointment. However, his harshness stems from his own regrets.
Relationship with Haruhi: Their relationship is strained because Haruhi sees him as controlling and unfeeling, while he sees her as reckless and naive.
Young Nagano
Personality: Rebellious, passionate, and secretly vulnerable. He hides his sensitivity behind his tough exterior and his role in the motorcycle gang.
Appearance: Leather jacket, messy hair, and a guitar slung over his shoulder. He has a mischievous grin but a thoughtful gaze.
Conflict: He’s torn between his love for music and the pressure to follow his father’s path. He feels trapped by the expectations placed on him as the heir to the family business.
Dreams: He dreams of performing on stage and becoming a musician, but he knows his father will never approve.

How This Shapes the Story
Haruhi’s Perspective: Meeting young Nagano helps Haruhi see her father in a new light. She realizes that his strictness comes from a place of regret and fear, not just control.
Nagano’s Growth: Through Haruhi’s influence, young Nagano begins to confront his fears and consider standing up for his dreams, even if it’s just for a moment.
Thematic Depth: The story explores the cost of sacrificing one’s dreams for duty and whether it’s ever too late to reclaim what was lost.

In a vulnerable moment, Nagano tells Haruhi about his dream of performing on stage and how he feels trapped by his father’s expectations. This helps Haruhi understand why her present-day father is so strict.
The Performance:
Haruhi convinces Nagano to perform at the school festival, even if it’s just once. This becomes a pivotal moment in the story, symbolizing Nagano’s courage to embrace his passion, even briefly.
The Heartbreaking Decision:
After the festival, Nagano tells Haruhi that he’s decided to follow his father’s wishes and study engineering. This moment is bittersweet and mirrors the sacrifices Haruhi’s present-day father has made.
Haruhi’s Realization:

            <Title>Chaoter 3 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>The morning sunlight streamed through the classroom windows, casting a warm glow over the rows of desks. Haruki sat at her usual spot, her sketchbook open in front of her, pencil moving swiftly across the page. Instead of her classmates, the desks in her drawing were occupied by whimsical creatures—a fox with nine tails lounged in the corner, a dragon coiled around the teacher’s podium, and a flock of tiny winged sprites flitted through the air. A smirk tugged at her lips as she added the finishing touches to a griffin perched smugly on Aiko’s desk.
Aiko, seated beside her, leaned over to peek at the sketch. “You look unusually happy today,” she noted, her tone equal parts curious and suspicious. “Did something good happen?”
Across from them, Akihito sat with his arms crossed, half-listening while flipping through his own notebook. He raised an eyebrow at Haruki’s expression but didn’t comment.
Haruki didn’t look up, her pencil still moving. “I submitted my Career Plan,” she said, her voice light and sing-songy.
Aiko’s eyes widened, and she practically shot forward in her chair. “You did?!” she exclaimed, much too loud for the classroom. A few students glanced their way, but Aiko didn’t seem to care. “What did you pick?”
Haruki finally looked up, drawing out the moment with an infuriatingly smug grin. “Tokyo University,” she said, pausing dramatically. “Fine Arts program.”
Aiko and Akihito reacted at the same time—
“What?!” Aiko gasped, her eyes sparkling with surprise.
“WHAT?!” Akihito groaned, his tone laced with horror.
Meanwhile, Akihito rubbed his temples as if physically pained. “Look, I know you’re impulsive and stubborn as a mule, but I didn’t think you’d just impulsively decide the trajectory of your career in a day, let alone from my off-hand remarks.” He stared at her in disbelief.
Haruki scoffed, half-annoyed. “Look, you were the one who suggested Tokyo University yesterday!”
“Suggested!” Akihito emphasized the word. “I was thinking at least you’d put it into consideration as one of your choices, not nose-dive into it!”
“But I want to go to Tokyo University,” Haruki said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Akihito exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Look—” he started, his voice filled with exasperation. “Did at least your parents approve of it?”
“No,” Haruki said in a sing-songy tone.
Akihito stared at her, deadpan. “Of course.”
Aiko snorted, clapping Haruki on the back. “Well, you’re in for an interesting conversation at home.”
Haruki grinned, twirling her pencil between her fingers. “Oh, I’m well aware.”
Akihito groaned, dropping his head onto his desk in defeat, “You’re crazy.”
Haruki shrugged, her pencil still moving. “Maybe. But it’s my future, not theirs.”
Aiko leaned back in her chair, running a hand through her hair. “Wow. I mean, I knew you were stubborn, but this is next level. What are you going to do when they find out?”
Haruki’s smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. “I’ll deal with it when the time comes,” she said, her tone casual. “For now, I’m just happy I finally made a decision.”
Akihito shook his head. “You’re unbelievable, you know that? But hey, It takes guts to go after what you want.”
Haruki chuckled, her smug expression softening. “Thanks. That means a lot.”
The bell rang, signaling the start of class, and the room filled with the sound of shuffling papers and murmured conversations. Haruki closed her sketchbook and tucked it into her bag, her mind already wandering to the future. For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was in control of her own destiny.

-o-

The school day had ended, and the hallways buzzed with the chatter of students heading to clubs, cram school, or home. Haruki stretched her arms above her head as she walked, a grin spreading across her face. “Ahh, I’ve been waiting for this all week,” she mused aloud. “Today’s the plein air session! I wonder where we’ll go this time. Maybe the riverside? Or that garden behind the old shrine? Ugh, I can’t wait to just sit outside and paint.”
Aiko trailed beside her, shaking her head. “You’re way too excited for someone who just turned their entire career plan into an act of rebellion.”
Behind them, Akihito sighed, his hands stuffed into his pockets as he matched their pace. “I thought you’d at least talk with your parents and try to convince them, Haruki,” he said, his tone serious. “Arguing against your parents is one thing, but going against them is another.”
“Yeah,” Aiko chimed in, nodding sagely. “You know, like, make a PowerPoint presentation or something. ‘Top Ten Reasons Why I Should Go to Art School.’”
Haruki smirked. “You’re siding with him, Aiko? I thought you were all about rebelling against parental expectations with me.”
“I know,” Aiko groaned dramatically, throwing her hands up. “But me arguing with my parents is one thing—we argue all the time. You arguing with your parents is another thing entirely.” She gave Haruki a pointed look. “Your parents are scary.”
“Yeah, look.” Akihito shot her a skeptical glance. “Tell me you’ve at least discussed this with one of them.”
Haruki smirked but didn’t slow her pace. “I talked with my mom,” she said simply.
Akihito narrowed his eyes. “And your dad?”
Haruki shrugged. “He wasn’t around,” she said, her voice casual. “But I don’t think he’d care.”
Akihito let out a sharp breath, running a hand through his hair. “You’re crazy,” he muttered. “Do you even hear yourself? Your dad’s not just some businessman—he’s the CEO of a major automotive company. Of course he’d care!”
Haruki stopped in her tracks and turned to face him, her expression calm but unwavering. “No, he wasn’t around,” she said, emphasizing each word. “He’s never around. He’s too busy with work to care about what I do.”
Akihito frowned but didn’t argue. Aiko shifted uncomfortably beside them, her gaze darting between the two.
Haruki sighed, gripping her sketchbook tighter. “Look, I know it sounds reckless, but I can’t keep waiting for their approval. If I do, I’ll never get to live my life. I have to take this step, even if it’s scary.”
Akihito’s jaw tightened. “That’s not the point. You might not care about what they think, but they’ll definitely care about you going against them. And your parents aren’t exactly the ‘let it go’ type.”
Haruki nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I know. But I’ll figure it out. I always do.”


-o-

As Haruki sled the door open to the arts club room, the room was buzzing with energy as club members prepared for their weekly plein air session. Easels were being adjusted, canvases stacked, sketchbooks flipped open, and tubes of paint uncapped. The faint scent of oil paint and graphite filled the air, mixing with the chatter of students discussing the best locations for today’s outing.
At the center of it all, like a captain amidst a storm of creativity, stood Makoto, the Art Club’s president. He was giving instructions to a group of younger students, gesturing animatedly with a charcoal stick in hand.
But as Haruki scanned the room, something unusual caught her eye—someone who definitely wasn’t a regular in the Art Club.
Mrs. Kitagawa.
Haruki stiffened. What was the school counselor doing here?
Aiko and Akihito entered behind her, the three of them exchanging wary glances. Before Haruki could dwell on it, Makoto’s voice rang out over the hum of activity.
“Haruki! Mrs. Kitagawa wants to see you.”
A murmur of curiosity rippled through the club, but everyone quickly went back to their preparations.
Haruki exhaled, schooling her expression into something neutral. She slung her bag off her shoulder, setting it down in the corner, before making her way toward Mrs. Kitagawa.
Haruki crossed her arms, shifting her weight slightly as she faced Mrs. Kitagawa. “If this is about my Career Plans form, I swear I submitted it this morning,” she said, forcing a small, confident smile. “I didn’t forget.”
Mrs. Kitagawa nodded. “Yes, I received it.”
Haruki tilted her head. Then what is it?
“But that’s not why I called you here,” Mrs. Kitagawa continued, her tone even, measured.
Haruki’s stomach dipped slightly. Her fingers curled around the strap of her bag. “Then… why?”
There was a pause.
Mrs. Kitagawa exhaled softly before delivering the news. “Your father is in the teacher’s office. He’s here to pick you up for a family occasion.”
Haruki felt the words before she fully processed them—a strange weight settling in her chest, as if the air had thickened around her.
Her grip tightened on her bag. “What?”
Mrs. Kitagawa’s expression remained gentle but firm. “Your father requested that you leave with him immediately.”
Haruki’s pulse quickened. This had to be a mistake. Her father never just showed up like this. He was supposed to be too busy for things like unannounced visits.
And today—today—was the club’s plein air session.
“But I have club activities,” she argued, her voice steadier than she felt. “We’re heading out for plein air today, and Makoto needs my help with the first-years—I can’t be absent.”
“I understand,” Mrs. Kitagawa said, her voice soft but unwavering. “But this is your father’s request.”
Request.
No, this wasn’t a request. It was an order.
The weight in her chest sank lower. There was no room for negotiation here.
Slowly, reluctantly, she turned toward Akihito. “Can you cover for me?” she asked, her voice quieter now. “Help Makoto with the first-years?”
Akihito hesitated for a fraction of a second before nodding. “Yeah. Don’t worry about it.”
Haruki swallowed, then reached for her bag. The excitement from earlier—the rush of stepping into the clubroom, the anticipation of an afternoon spent outside with paint and sunlight—was gone, drained out of her like ink washing away in the rain.
Without another word, she followed Mrs. Kitagawa toward the door.
Aiko and Akihito stood in silence, watching her go. 

-o-

Haruki trailed behind Mrs. Kitagawa, her steps slower than they needed to be, as if dragging her feet might somehow delay the inevitable.
This is it…
The thought settled heavily in her chest, dull and suffocating. She watched as the club rooms passed by—each doorway revealing glimpses of students lost in their passions.
The soft melody of a violin drifted from the music room, accompanied by the occasional stumble of fingers pressing the wrong note. Someone in the literature club gestured wildly as they debated over a novel, voices overlapping in a lively discussion. Inside the manga club, students huddled around a table, sketching, erasing, redrawing—completely immersed in their craft.
They were all doing what they loved. Pursuing what made them feel alive.
Haruki swallowed hard. And I’m walking the green mile.
She felt it with every step—like she was heading toward something final, something irreversible. As if, the moment she reached that office, she wouldn’t just be facing her father.
She’d be facing the end of her dream.
Her fingers tightened around the strap of her bag.
No. Not yet.
She kept walking, but the weight in her chest only grew heavier.
Haruki stepped into the teacher’s office, her breath catching for a split second.
There he was.
Nagano Fujiyama.
Even in the casual setting of a school, he exuded the same commanding presence that made boardrooms fall silent upon his arrival. His tailored suit sat flawlessly on his frame, not a crease in sight. His dark hair, streaked with silver, was neatly pulled back, revealing sharp, assessing eyes that took in everything without a hint of warmth. Around his fingers gleamed heavy rings—symbols of wealth and power.
The nametag still hung from his neck, CEO of Fujiyama Automotive Company. As if he needed a reminder. 
As if she did.
Mrs. Kitagawa cleared her throat lightly, stepping aside as he offered her a slight bow.
&quot;Thanks for bringing my daughter,&quot; he said smoothly, his voice even, businesslike. Then, finally, he turned his gaze on Haruki.
“Haruki…”
Just her name. Simple. Unreadable.
She gripped the strap of her bag, her heartbeat quickening.
&quot;Come,&quot; he said, gesturing toward the hallway. &quot;We’re going to talk.&quot;
It wasn’t a request.

            <Notes>Explain Haruhi’s relationship with Yaeko Matsuda, the former Vice-President of the arts club


At the end when they arrive at the Arts Club room, they were met with Mrs. Kitagawa

They thought she still wanted the unsubmitted paper, and Haruki explained that she had submitted it, 

Mrs. Kitagawa then said that she had rechieved it, she’s here because Haruki’s Father is here at the teacher’s office to pick her up

Haruki argued that she still had Club Activities to attend to, but Mrs. Kitagawa said that it was her father’s order, and so she asked Akihito to take over as Vice-President and help Makoto who is the president during today’s plein air session.

            <Title>Chapter 1.5  RAW</Title>
            <Text>The last of the students had trickled out, leaving behind the familiar post-club mess—dried paint smears on the tables, sponges abandoned in water cups, the scent of turpentine mixed with the sharp smell of acrylics. 
Haruki stacked the final canvas board onto the storage shelf, her muscles moving on autopilot after years of this routine.
 &quot;I swear,” Aiko groaned, “Those three gremlins are trying to become abstract artist themselves,&quot; she said, gesturing to the dried splatters of cerulean and crimson on the floor where the chaotic trio had been experimenting
Akihito was already scrubbing at a stubborn oil pastel mark on the table. &quot;At least Kenzo’s improving,&quot; he remarked. &quot;His figure sketches were decent. But the moment he picks up a brush, he didn’t really do good.&quot;
Haruki chuckled, tossing a crumpled paper towel at him. &quot;Be nice. He’s got the eye for proportions—just needs to loosen up.&quot; She mimed stiff brushstrokes in the air. &quot;He paints like he’s afraid the paints cost an arm and legs.&quot;
&quot;Have you seen Naoko’s painting?&quot; Aiko grinned, propping her chin on her palm. &quot;Her cliffs today looked like they’d survive the apocalypse. But when I asked her to paint a tree next to them it became an Instant lollipop sticks.&quot;
&quot;Specialization isn’t a bad thing, Aiko.&quot; Haruki said, wiping her hands on her already-stained apron. &quot;Maybe we should encourage her to draw more rocks.&quot;
“She need to learn to paint something else, what is she? A rock painter?” Aiko said
But before they could continue, the door creaked open.
Haruki turned, expecting to see a first-year retrieving a forgotten sketchbook. Instead, the silhouette of Mrs. Matsuoka filled the doorway, her face lit by the golden haze of sunset streaming in from the hallway.
Their arts and craft teacher stood with her usual quiet grace, her cardigan sleeves rolled up to the elbows—practical, as always. Silver streaked through her otherwise dark hair, and her round glasses caught the light as she smiled. The lines around her eyes deepened with warmth.
All three students straightened instinctively. &quot;Good evening, Mrs. Matsuoka!&quot; they chorused, bowing in unison.
Mrs. Matsuoka chuckled, stepping inside. &quot;No need for formalities,&quot; she said, her voice as soothing as the hum of the old radiator in winter. 
&quot;Fujiyama-san,” Mrs. Matsuoka said, turning to Haruki, “Could I speak with you in my office?&quot; 
Haruki shot a questioning look at Aiko and Akihito. Aiko waved her off with both hands. &quot;Go, go! We've got this.&quot; She dramatically flexed her arms. &quot;These cleaning skills didn't earn me 'Vice President' for nothing.&quot;
Akihito simply nodded, already reorganizing the pigment tubes by color gradient.
&quot;Right...thanks,&quot; Haruki murmured, grabbing her bag. As she followed Mrs. Matsuoka out, the door clicked shut behind them.
The moment the footsteps faded, Aiko spun to Akihito, eyes sparkling with mischief. She pressed her back against the door and whispered, &quot;Do you think she's finally getting expelled?&quot;
Akihito didn't look up from his meticulous brush-cleaning. &quot;I'm actually surprised she hasn't been yet.&quot;

-o-

Haruki perched on the edge of Mrs. Matsuoka’s desk, her sneakers scuffing absently against the leg of the chair. 
The faculty office hummed with the end-of-day exodus.
Papers being flipped.
The click clacking of the computer keyboards.
The distant phone being rung and answered.
Haruki’s fingers drummed an uneven rhythm against the wood. Haruki’s feet bouncing up and down as she looked around.
A passing geography teacher paused to pat her shoulder. &quot;Working late, Fujiyama-san?”
Haruki grinned, though her knee kept bouncing. Matsuda-senpai, the club president before her had mentioned how Mrs. Matsuoka always summoned club presidents for tea, how the lavender blend was supposedly &quot;for calming restless minds&quot; 
The clink of porcelain announced Mrs. Matsuoka’s return before she did. 
Mrs.Matsuoka nudged the door open with her hip, balancing a tray with two steaming cups, their floral scent cutting through the office’s stale coffee smell. &quot;My apologies for the wait,&quot; she said, setting the tray down. A sugar cube tumbled from its dish, and Haruki caught it mid-air—a reflex honed from years of grabbing falling paintbrushes.
&quot;Oh, It’s no trouble at all!&quot; Haruki lied, her voice an octave too high. She’d been counting ceiling tiles for seven minutes.
Mrs. Matsuoka smiled knowingly as she settled into the worn armchairs by the window. Golden hour light bled through the blinds, striping the steam rising from their cups. For a long moment, there was only the sound of spoons stirring—Haruki adding three sugars discreetly, Mrs. Matsuoka just one.
Down the row of desks, the chemistry teacher laughed into his phone. &quot;Yes, yes—I’ll pick up milk on the way home—&quot;
Haruki traced the rim of her cup. The tea tasted sweet as she liked it, masking the lavender’s strong taste. The ceramic was warm beneath her fingertips.
Mrs. Matsuoka set her own cup down with deliberate care. &quot;How is the Art Club these days, Fujiyama-san?&quot; she asked, &quot;No troubles as president?&quot;
&quot;None at all,&quot; Haruki said, too quickly. 
Then, realizing how brittle that sounded, she rushed to fill the silence. &quot;I've kept up Matsuda-senpai's figure drawing sessions every Tuesday, just like she used to.” 
&quot;And tomorrow’s plein air session—we’re going back to that forest near the abandoned cabin. The light through the trees there is just...&quot; She trailed off, sketching shapes in the air with her hands. &quot;You should come! It’s your favorite spot, isn’t it?&quot;
Mrs. Matsuoka’s smile turned apologetic as she stacked the teacups. &quot;Duty calls, I’m afraid. I’m afraid I still have some paperworks to do.&quot;
Haruki’s shoulders slumped. &quot;But you always say that lately—&quot;
&quot;And I’m always right,&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka interrupted, though her eyes crinkled with amusement. &quot;Duty is duty, Fujiyama-san.&quot;
Haruki huffed, but the protest died on her lips as a new thought struck her. &quot;Oh! And I added something special for next week!&quot; She leaned forward, her earlier gloom forgotten. “I call it 'Limited Palette' challenges. I saw the idea online, where you only use three colors plus white. It's amazing what you can mix with just—&quot;
Her voice caught when she noticed Mrs. Matsuoka's expression. Not disapproval, but something far more dangerous—understanding.
&quot;You enjoy being Art Club president, don't you, Fujiyama-san?&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka said softly.
Haruki's fingers froze around the teacup. A drop of lavender tea trembled on the rim before falling onto the saucer with a quiet plink. The office suddenly felt too warm, the steam from their cups curling like hesitant ghosts between them.
&quot;I...&quot; Haruki's throat tightened. Outside, the school's brass band was practicing a distant, mournful tune - the notes slipping through the half-open window like intruders. She watched the way Mrs. Matsuoka's hands cradled her own cup - fingers stained with years of paint and chalk, just like Matsuda's used to be. &quot;Yes,&quot; she finally admitted, the word escaping like a held breath. &quot;I do.&quot;
Mrs. Matsuoka's eyes crinkled behind her glasses. &quot;I've always admired that about you, Fujiyama-san.&quot; She took a slow sip before continuing. &quot;You remind me so much of Matsuda-san in your best moments. The way you light up during demonstrations, how you remember every member's strengths...&quot; Her voice softened. &quot;You've finally taken up the baton she passed to you.&quot;
Haruki's chest ached. The compliment should have warmed her, but it settled like cold water in her stomach. &quot;Matsuda-senpai was... she was the greatest president we ever had.&quot; Her voice threatened to crack. &quot;I'm not-&quot;
&quot;Funny.&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka interrupted gently. &quot;That's not what the club members tell me.&quot; She reached into her desk drawer and produced a stack of colorful papers - the annual club feedback forms Haruki had forgotten they'd submitted last week. 
&quot;Naoko wrote that your limited palette workshop 'made colors feel like magic.'” Mrs. Matsuoka read one, “Kenzo said your figure drawing tips helped him finally 'see people the right way.'&quot; She tapped the top paper with one finger. &quot;And Aiko, bless her, wrote an entire essay about how you 'make art club feel like coming home.'&quot;
The distant band music swelled as Haruki stared at the papers. Somewhere in the hallway, a locker slammed shut. The afternoon light had shifted without her noticing - now it fell across Mrs. Matsuoka's desk in thick golden stripes, illuminating years of paint stains and coffee rings that Matsuda must have known just as well.
&quot;Which makes me wonder...&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka said, removing her black, metal-framed glasses with deliberate slowness. The lenses caught the light as she set them down, leaving her eyes unexpectedly bare and perceptive. &quot;Why are you postponing your career plan papers?&quot;
Haruki's heart drops. Of course. The praise had been a tactical maneuver, the compliment-laden equivalent of softening up clay before molding it. She should've seen this coming.
&quot;I, umm... hehe.&quot; The laugh escaped her like a deflating balloon, high-pitched and painfully transparent. &quot;You know how busy the Art Club keeps me, Mrs. Matsuoka! Between planning activities and mentoring first-years and—&quot;
&quot;Fujiyama-san.&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka's voice remained gentle, but the steel beneath it stopped Haruki mid-ramble. &quot;I gave you that paper three weeks ago.&quot;
The silence that followed was the heavy, sticky kind—the sort that made Haruki acutely aware of the second hand ticking on the wall clock, of the way her own pulse thudded in her ears. Outside, the brass band hit a discordant note, then fell silent.
Mrs. Matsuoka exhaled through her nose, the sound of someone choosing patience. &quot;If you're having difficulties,&quot; she said, tracing a finger along a particularly stubborn paint stain on her desk, &quot;you can always talk to me about it.&quot;
Haruki's fingers found the hem of her skirt, twisting the fabric. &quot;I, umm...&quot; The words came out in a staccato burst. &quot;I wanted to go to nursery school. Mom said it's... a more stable career.&quot;
The admission hung between them, limp and unconvincing. Even the words tasted wrong—like biting into fruit only to find it flavorless.
Mrs. Matsuoka raised one eyebrow, the effect magnified without her glasses to soften her expression. &quot;Then,&quot; she said, leaning forward slightly, &quot;why didn't you write that on the paper?&quot;
Haruki's gaze dropped to her lap, where her hands had gone suspiciously still. The afternoon light painted the back of her hands gold, highlighting every fleck of dried paint, every callus earned from hours gripping brushes. For a wild moment, she imagined the colors beneath her skin—the cadmium red of embarrassment, the Prussian blue of longing, all swirling together in some impossible shade of indecision.
&quot;I...&quot; Her voice cracked. &quot;I'm not sure.&quot;
The confession hung in the air between them, fragile as the steam still curling from their forgotten teacups. Mrs. Matsuoka's expression softened—not with pity, but with quiet understanding. She set down her pen with deliberate care, the click of it against the desk somehow final.
&quot;So,&quot; she said, tilting her head just slightly, &quot;you want to go to nursery school? Or is that your mother's wish?&quot;
Haruki's fingers twitched against her skirt. The question was gentle, but it pierced straight through her defenses like a brushstroke cutting through wet paint. Outside, the brass band had moved on to a livelier tune, the jaunty melody at odds with the heaviness in her chest.
&quot;Fujiyama-san,&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka continued when Haruki stayed silent, &quot;I've known you since your second year.&quot; A faint smile played at her lips. &quot;And you don't exactly have the makings of a nurse.&quot;
Haruki blinked.
Mrs. Matsuoka counted off on her paint-stained fingers: &quot;You trip over your own feet at least twice a week. You're late to morning meetings more often than not. And just last month, you forgot your own club budget forms in the cafeteria—twice.&quot; She chuckled, the sound warm. &quot;I pity your future patients if you pursue that path.&quot;
A startled laugh burst from Haruki's lips—half relief, half embarrassment. But before she could retort, Mrs. Matsuoka's expression sobered.
&quot;However,&quot; she said, leaning forward, &quot;You do have all the marks of an artist.&quot;
Haruki's breath caught.
Mrs. Matsuoka's gaze was unwavering. &quot;The way the club members light up when you explain a new technique. Those 'limited palette' challenges you devised—unconventional, but brilliant. And,&quot; she added pointedly, &quot;you're the only president who's ever memorized every member's strengths and weaknesses by heart.&quot;
A warmth bloomed in Haruki's chest, tentative but undeniable. It was one thing to know these things about herself—another entirely to hear them spoken aloud with such conviction.
She ducked her head, suddenly fascinated by a fleck of dried blue paint on her wrist. &quot;Well, I... probably will consider nursery school,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;Mom says it has decent pay.&quot;
The words tasted like a compromise, bitter on her tongue.
Mrs. Matsuoka studied her for a long moment before sighing. &quot;I see,&quot; she said simply. She slid the Career Plan paper back across the desk, the movement smooth and practiced. &quot;Talk to your mother about it,&quot; she advised, her voice firm but kind. &quot;These decisions require proper discussion between parent and child.&quot; She smiled then, though it didn't quite reach her eyes. &quot;We're done for today. You may go.&quot;
Haruki stood automatically, her chair scraping against the floor. The sound was too loud in the now-silent office—most of the other teachers had left for the day. She bowed slightly, the motion stiff with unspoken words.
Her fingers had just brushed the cool metal of the door handle when—
&quot;Haruki.&quot;
&quot;Y-yes?&quot; Haruki squaked. The sound of her given name—so rarely used by teachers—sent an electric jolt down her spine. She whirls around so fast her bag strap tangled around her elbow.
Mrs. Matsuoka stood framed by the window, the dying sun setting her silver-streaked hair aflame as she gathered their teacups. The light rendered her features indistinct, transforming her into something between a woman and a silhouette cut from golden paper.
&quot;Take it from me,&quot; she said, her voice carrying the weight of decades as she wiped a cup with methodical strokes, &quot;As a woman in her sixties. I assume your parents are of similar age.&quot; 
The ceramic clinked softly against the tray. 
&quot;Decades from now,” Mrs. Matsuoka continued, “I'll be lying beneath the ground while you'll struggle to live. Whether that life is happy or merely stable...&quot; She looked up, her glasses catching fire from the sunset. &quot;That choice is yours to be made.&quot;
Haruki's mouth went dry. The air between them seemed to vibrate with the unspoken truth—that this wasn't just career advice, but an heirloom passed between generations of artists.
&quot;That's...&quot; Haruki swallowed. &quot;Grim.&quot;
Mrs. Matsuoka's chuckle was as dry as autumn leaves. &quot;So is reality, my dear.&quot; She set down the cleaned cup with finality. 
&quot;So choose wisely.&quot; Mrs. Matsuoka added. The dismissal in her tone was softened, &quot;Go on now. Don't go home too late.&quot;
For a heartbeat, Haruki hesitated. As she turned to leave, the late afternoon sun streamed through the windows, casting long shadows across the floor. For a fleeting moment, Haruki imagined she saw the ghostly outline of Matsuda's braid in the slanting light.
Then the door clicked shut behind her, and the illusion vanished.

            <Title>Chapter 16 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The next few weeks were a chaotic mess of failed attempts and mounting frustration for Haruki. Determined to get Nagano and Honoka together before the end of summer, she threw herself into the role of matchmaker with all the subtlety of an elephant in an orchestra. Unfortunately, her efforts were met with one disaster after another.
Haruki had thought her plan was foolproof. She convinced the PE teacher—with a combination of flattery, persistence, and a well-timed offer to clean the equipment shed—to schedule Class 1A and Class 2A for a joint volleyball session. Haruki’s heart raced as she watched Nagano and his friends saunter onto the court, their laughter echoing across the gym. This was it. This was her chance.
She quickly paired herself with Honoka, hoping to steer her toward Nagano’s team. But Honoka, ever the shy and studious type, turned bright red at the mere suggestion of playing with the boys.
“I-I can’t!” Honoka stammered, clutching her volleyball like a lifeline. “What if I mess up? What if they laugh at me?”
“They won’t laugh at you!” Haruki insisted, her voice a little too loud. “Nagano’s really nice, I promise!”
But Honoka was already retreating to the safety of the girls’ team, leaving Haruki to face Nagano’s team alone. The match ended with Haruki getting hit in the face with the ball—twice—and Nagano teasing her mercilessly about her “unique” playing style.
Undeterred, Haruki hatched another plan. This time, she convinced Nagano to help her transport a stack of freshly printed papers from the Literature Club’s print room to the editing department. She had heard Honoka mention something about editing, so surely this would work.
“Why do I have to carry all these?” Nagano grumbled, his arms laden with papers as they trudged down the hallway.
“Because you’re strong and reliable,” Haruki said, flashing him her most convincing smile. “And because I’ll buy you a soda later.”
Nagano rolled his eyes but didn’t complain further. Haruki’s heart raced as they approached the editing department. This was it. Honoka would be there, and they’d strike up a conversation, and everything would fall into place.
But when they arrived, the room was empty except for a lone third-year student who looked up from their desk with a bored expression. “Oh, the editing team’s in the other building today,” they said. “You’re looking for the print department, right?”
Haruki’s smile froze on her face. “Uh… right. Thanks.”
Nagano shot her a suspicious look. “Did you even know where we were going?”
“Of course I did!” Haruki lied, her cheeks burning. “I just… got the buildings mixed up. Let’s go!”
By the time they found the correct department, Honoka was long gone, and Haruki was out two sodas.
Haruki’s third attempt was perhaps the most ambitious—and the most disastrous. She convinced Honoka to join her after school, claiming they were going to “hang out” with some of the boys from Class 2A. Honoka, though reluctant, agreed—mostly because Haruki had promised to help her with a difficult math problem.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Honoka asked nervously as they waited outside the school gates. “I don’t really know these boys…”
“It’ll be fine!” Haruki said, her voice a little too cheerful. “They’re really nice. And Nagano’s coming too!”
Honoka’s eyes widened. “Nagano?”
“Yeah!” Haruki said, grinning. “He’s super cool. You’ll like him.”
But as the minutes ticked by, it became clear that something was wrong. The boys never showed up. After an hour of waiting, Honoka finally sighed and turned to Haruki. “Maybe they’re not coming. Should we just go home?”
Haruki’s heart sank. She had been so sure this would work. “Yeah… I guess so.”
As they walked home, Haruki couldn’t help but feel a pang of guilt. Honoka had trusted her, and she had let her down. Again.

-o-

Haruki sat at a desk in the Editing Department of the Literature Club, her chin resting heavily on her hand as she doodled aimlessly on a scrap of paper. The room was quiet, save for the soft rustle of pages and the occasional scratch of a pen. Honoka sat a few desks away, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reviewed poem entries for the school’s annual magazine.
Haruki’s doodles grew more aggressive as her frustration mounted. She had tried everything—every plan, every scheme—and still, Nagano and Honoka hadn’t so much as exchanged more than a passing greeting. The end of summer was creeping closer, and Haruki could feel the weight of her failure pressing down on her.
“Haruki-chan,” Honoka’s voice broke through her thoughts, soft and hesitant. “What do you think of this one?”
Haruki glanced up to see Honoka holding up two sheets of paper, each covered in neatly written haikus. She sighed, her indifference evident as she pointed to one at random. “That one.”
Honoka blinked, her expression puzzled. “You didn’t even read them.”
“Does it matter?” Haruki muttered, slumping back in her chair. “They’re all the same anyway.”
Honoka frowned, setting the papers down and turning to face Haruki fully. “Haruki-chan… is something wrong? You’ve been acting strange all week.”
Haruki hesitated, her gaze dropping to the doodles on her paper. She wanted to tell Honoka everything—about the time travel, about her mission, about the fear that she might never go home. But how could she? How could she explain something so unbelievable to someone who wouldn’t—couldn’t—understand?
“It’s nothing,” Haruki said finally, her voice flat. “Just… tired, I guess.”
Honoka was silent for a moment, her expression thoughtful. Then, hesitantly, she spoke again. “It’s about Nagano-kun, isn’t it?”
Haruki’s head snapped up, her eyes wide. “W-what? No! I mean… it’s not like that!” she stammered, her face flushing. She didn’t know how to explain that her frustration was about Honoka and Nagano, not herself. The words tangled in her throat, leaving her flustered and unsure.
Honoka’s expression turned stern, her usual gentle demeanor replaced by something sharper. “If you like him, just say so,” she said, her voice firm. “Haruki-chan, I’ll step aside for you. You don’t have to hide it.”
Haruki was taken aback, her mind racing. This wasn’t what she had intended at all. But as she thought about it, she realized how it must look. She had been spending so much time with Nagano lately, trying to orchestrate moments for him and Honoka, that she hadn’t noticed the whispers and sideways glances from their classmates. In a school where interactions between boys and girls were scrutinized, her efforts had backfired spectacularly. Rumors had spread, and now everyone—including Honoka—thought Haruki was trying to win Nagano’s affection.
“Honoka, it’s not like that,” Haruki said, her voice desperate. “I’m not interested in Nagano. I was just… I was trying to help you get closer to him.”
Honoka’s eyes widened, but then her expression hardened. “I don’t want your help,” she said, her voice trembling. “I’m fine with how things are. I don’t need you meddling in my life.”
Haruki opened her mouth to argue, to explain herself, but Honoka cut her off. “Just stop it,” she pleaded, her voice cracking. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she quickly turned away, wiping them with her sleeve.
The room fell silent, the weight of Honoka’s words hanging heavily in the air. Haruki watched, her chest tightening as Honoka gathered the submitted haikus and crammed them into her schoolbag. Her movements were quick and jerky, as if she couldn’t get out of the room fast enough.
“I’m going to sort all of this at home,” Honoka said, her voice barely above a whisper. She stood up, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “I’m sorry for acting rudely, Fujiyama-san.”
And with that, she slid the door shut behind her, leaving Haruki alone in the empty editing room.
Haruki sat there, stunned, her mind reeling. The sound of the door closing echoed in her ears, a final, painful punctuation to the conversation. She slumped forward, resting her forehead on the desk, and let out a long, shaky breath.

            <Title>Chaoter 3 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The morning sunlight streamed through the classroom windows, casting a warm glow over the rows of desks. Haruhi sat at her usual spot, her sketchbook open in front of her. Her pencil moved swiftly across the page, bringing to life a fantastical version of the classroom. Instead of her classmates, the desks were occupied by whimsical creatures—a fox with nine tails lounged in the corner, a dragon coiled around the teacher’s podium, and a flock of tiny winged sprites flitted through the air. Haruhi’s lips curled into a small, smug smile as she added the finishing touches to a griffin perched on Aiko’s desk.
Aiko, sitting beside her, glanced over and raised an eyebrow. “You look unusually happy today,” she said, her tone equal parts curious and suspicious. “Did something good happen?”
Haruhi didn’t look up, her pencil still moving across the page. “I submitted my Career Plan,” she said, her voice light and sing-songy.
Aiko’s eyes widened, and she leaned closer. “You did?!” she exclaimed, her voice a little too loud. A few heads turned in their direction, but Aiko didn’t seem to notice. “What did you pick?”
Haruhi finally looked up, her smug smile widening. “Tokyo University,” she said, pausing for dramatic effect. “Fine Arts program.”
Aiko stared at her, her mouth hanging open. “Seriously?!” she said, her voice a mix of excitement and disbelief. “Did your parents approve of it?”
Haruhi’s smile didn’t waver. “No,” she said simply, turning back to her sketchbook.
Aiko blinked, processing the information. “Wait, what?” she said, her voice rising an octave. “You submitted it without telling them? are you crazy?!”
Haruhi shrugged, her pencil still moving. “Maybe. But it’s my future, not theirs.”
Aiko leaned back in her chair, running a hand through her hair. “Wow. I mean, I knew you were stubborn, but this is next level. What are you going to do when they find out?”
Haruhi’s smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered. “I’ll deal with it when the time comes,” she said, her tone casual. “For now, I’m just happy I finally made a decision.”
Aiko shook her head, but a grin spread across her face. “You’re unbelievable, you know that? But hey, I’m proud of you. It takes guts to go after what you want.”
Haruhi chuckled, her smug expression softening. “Thanks. That means a lot.”
The bell rang, signaling the start of class, and the room filled with the sound of shuffling papers and murmured conversations. Haruhi closed her sketchbook and tucked it into her bag, her mind already wandering to the future. For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was in control of her own destiny.

-o-

The school day had ended, and the hallways buzzed with the chatter of students heading to clubs, cram school, or home. Haruhi walked briskly toward the Art Club room, her bag slung over one shoulder and her sketchbook tucked under her arm. Aiko trailed behind her, trying to keep up while simultaneously prying more information out of her friend.
“You know,” Aiko said, her tone a mix of exasperation and admiration, “I thought you’d at least talk with your parents and try to convince them, Haruhi. You know, like, make a PowerPoint presentation or something. ‘Top Ten Reasons Why I Should Go to Art School.’”
Haruhi smirked but didn’t slow her pace. “I talked with my mom,” she said simply.
Aiko raised an eyebrow. “And your dad?”
“He wasn’t around,” Haruhi replied, her voice casual. “But I don’t think he’d care.”
Aiko stopped in her tracks, her mouth dropping open. “You’re crazy,” she said, her voice rising. “Do you even hear yourself? Your dad’s, like, the CEO of a major company. Of course he’d care!”
Haruhi paused and turned to face Aiko, her expression calm but firm. “No, he wasn’t around,” she repeated, emphasizing each word. “He’s never around. He’s too busy with work to care about what I do.”
Aiko stared at her, her usual playful demeanor replaced by genuine concern. “Haruhi…”
Haruhi sighed and looked away, her grip tightening on her sketchbook. “Look, I know it sounds reckless, but I can’t keep waiting for their approval. If I do, I’ll never get to live my life. I have to take this step, even if it’s scary.”
Aiko was silent for a moment, then she stepped forward and placed a hand on Haruhi’s shoulder. “You’re braver than I’ll ever be,” she said, her voice soft. “But just… be careful, okay? Your parents aren’t exactly the forgiving type.”
Haruhi nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I know. But I’ll figure it out. I always do.”
Aiko grinned and punched her lightly on the arm. “That’s the spirit! Now, let’s get to the Art Club before someone steals all the good paintbrushes.”
Haruhi laughed, the tension in her chest easing slightly. As they continued down the hallway, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief. For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was moving forward, even if the path ahead was uncertain.
But as they turned the corner toward the Art Club room, Haruhi’s smile faded slightly. She knew the real challenges were still to come. Her parents would find out about her decision eventually, and when they did, there would be no turning back.
Still, she couldn’t help but feel a flicker of hope. She had taken the first step, and that was something no one could take away from her.

            <Text>Knock, knock, knock.
Yaeko Matsuda stood in front of the bathroom door, her arms crossed and her foot tapping impatiently. The sound of running water had stopped a while ago, but Haruki was still holed up inside, and Matsuda was running out of patience.
“Haruki!” she called, her voice sharp but not unkind. “Come on, you’ve been in there for three hours! Hot water isn’t cheap in these times, you know!”
Inside the bathroom, Haruki was huddled in the bathtub, her knees pulled to her chest and her arms wrapped around them. The hot water she had drawn earlier had long since turned lukewarm, but she couldn’t bring herself to get out. Her mind was a whirlwind of regret and self-pity, and the bathroom felt like the only place she could hide from the world.
“Five more minutes!” Haruki called back, her voice muffled by the running water.
Matsuda groaned, leaning her forehead against the door. “That’s what you said an hour ago! I want to take a bath too!”
There was a pause, and then Matsuda added, her tone a little softer, “If you’re in there wallowing in pain because some boy from the sixties hurt your feelings, you can talk to me about it! But not until I take a bath!”
Haruki sighed, her shoulders slumping. She knew Matsuda-senpai was right—she couldn’t stay in the bathroom forever. But the thought of facing the world, of admitting her failure, felt like too much to bear.
Still, the sound of Matsuda’s foot tapping outside the door was getting harder to ignore. With a reluctant groan, Haruki pulled herself out of the tub, the water sloshing around her as she stood. She wrapped a towel around herself and shuffled to the door, her hair dripping and her expression a mix of annoyance and defeat.
She opened the door just enough to peek out, her eyes meeting Matsuda’s impatient gaze. 
“Here you go,” Haruki said flatly, stepping aside to let Matsuda in.
Matsuda raised an eyebrow, taking in Haruki’s disheveled appearance. “Thank you,” she said, her tone dry but not unkind. She stepped into the bathroom, then paused, turning back to Haruki. “And don’t think you’re off the hook. We’re talking about this as soon as I’m done.”
Haruki groaned, pulling the towel tighter around herself. “Do we have to?”
“Yes,” Matsuda said firmly, closing the door behind her. “Now go put some clothes on. You look like a lost chilld.”

-o-

The night was calm, the air filled with the soft hum of cicadas and the occasional rustle of grass in the breeze. Fireflies danced in the garden, their tiny lights flickering like stars against the dark backdrop of the trees. Haruki sat on the porch bench, her legs tucked beneath her and a fresh sweater keeping her warm. Her slightly short, curly hair was tied into a messy bun, and her eyes were fixed on the fireflies, though her mind was elsewhere.
The door creaked open, and Matsuda stepped out, holding two steaming cups of tea. She handed one to Haruki, who accepted it with a quiet “thank you,” and then sat down beside her on the bench. For a moment, they sat in silence, sipping their tea and watching the fireflies.
Finally, Matsuda broke the quiet. “Now,” she said, her tone gentle but firm, “care to tell me what happened?”
Haruki sighed, her grip tightening around the warm cup. “It’s just… it’s complicated.”
Matsuda chuckled softly. “Everything is. You just have to not make it complicated, and then everything will be easy to do.”
Haruki pouted, shooting Matsuda a sideways glance. “Easy for you to say.”
Matsuda smiled, unfazed. “Do you still remember the painting technique I told you about?”
Haruki frowned, her brow furrowing. “Which one?”
“The one about starting with a fresh canvas,” Matsuda said, her tone patient. “When you first get a new canvas and want to make a picture, what are the steps?”
Haruki thought for a moment. “You… get the paints?”
“What’s next?”
“You paint the underpaintings?”
“And after that?”
“You paint the bigger shapes, then work out the details.”
Matsuda nodded, her smile widening. “And do you think painting is hard?”
Haruki hesitated, then shook her head. “No… I don’t think so.”
“There you go,” Matsuda said, her tone triumphant. “It’s the same with life. You start with the basics, then build from there. You don’t have to figure everything out at once. Just take it one step at a time.”
Haruki smiled faintly, her gaze still fixed on the fireflies flickering in the garden. “You’re always so wise, Matsuda-senpai.”
Matsuda chuckled softly, leaning back against the bench. “Let’s just say… I’ve had my own fair share of lessons.”
They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, the night air filled with the rhythmic chirping of cicadas and the distant hum of car headlights on the streets beyond the woods. The fireflies danced in the darkness, their tiny lights weaving patterns in the air, and for a moment, the world felt still.
Eventually, Haruki broke the quiet, her voice soft but heavy with emotion. “I don’t think I’ll be going back.”
Matsuda paused, setting her teacup down on the porch railing. “Hmm?” she asked, her tone gentle but curious. “What makes you think that?”
Haruki pulled her knees to her chest, burying her face in them as if she could hide from the weight of her words. “My parents…” she began, her voice muffled. “The love doesn’t go both ways. And my mom hates me. I don’t think I have a chance anymore.”
Matsuda was silent for a moment, her expression thoughtful. She reached over and placed a hand on Haruki’s shoulder, her touch warm and reassuring. “I don’t think your mom  hate you, Haruki-chan. I think she’s just… hurt. And confused. Maybe just like you are now.”
Haruki shook her head, her voice trembling. “You didn’t see her face, Matsuda-senpai. She looked at me like I was some kind of… stranger. Like I had betrayed her.”
“People say and do things they don’t mean when they’re hurt,” Matsuda said softly. “That doesn’t mean they stop caring.”
Haruki sighed, her shoulders slumping as she stared at the fireflies. “I got into an argument with my father too,” she admitted, her voice quiet. “I knew he didn’t do anything wrong, but I got so angry. I screamed at him and ran away. He’ll probably never talk to me again after that.”
Matsuda let out a small giggle, the sound light and unexpected.
Haruki turned to her, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. “Don’t laugh! What’s so funny?!”
Matsuda waved a hand, trying to stifle her laughter. “Oh, it’s nothing… It’s just… it’s absurd. But absurdly funny.”
Haruki pouted, crossing her arms as Matsuda continued to chuckle. She stayed silent, her annoyance growing, until finally she muttered, “What do I do now…”
Matsuda wiped a tear from the corner of her eye, her laughter subsiding. “Say, Haruki-chan,” she began, her tone thoughtful, “if by chance your parents haven’t fallen in love by this time… I think they still love something else, don’t they?”
Haruki frowned, confused. “What do you mean?”
“For example,” Matsuda said, leaning back against the bench, “my father was really into bicycles. He collected a bunch of them. And my mother loved gardening. Before they loved each other, they loved those things. I suppose your parents have something they love too, don’t they? A hobby? A passion?”
Haruki fell silent for a moment, her gaze drifting to her nearly empty teacup. She swirled the leaves around, her mind racing. Nagano and Honoka did have something they loved. She remembered how Nagano played the guitar and sang Ue o Muite Arukō, his voice warm and full of emotion. He was good—really good. And Honoka… she was always writing poetry or haiku during free moments in class, her passion for words shining through in every line. She loved editing for the Literature Club, pouring her heart into every page.
“My father always loved music,” Haruki mumbled, her voice soft. “And my mother loves poetry.”
Matsuda smiled, her eyes twinkling. “That’s it. And if you work with the things they love, I think you can bring them together. Think of it as your primary colors.”
Haruki sat there for a moment, the words sinking in. Then, like a spark igniting, an epiphany hit her. She shot to her feet, her eyes wide with excitement. “I got it!” she exclaimed, her voice ringing out in the quiet night. “Matsuda-senpai, you’re a genius!”
Before Matsuda could respond, Haruki threw her arms around her in a tight hug, then dashed back into the cabin, her footsteps echoing on the wooden floor. Matsuda watched through the window as Haruki rushed to her notebooks and sketchbooks, her hands flying as she began to scribble down ideas and plans.
Matsuda smiled, a quiet sense of pride swelling in her chest. Haruki, her kouhai, still had that fire in her. That determination, that spark of creativity—it was what made her special. And Matsuda knew, no matter how many obstacles lay ahead, Haruki would find a way to overcome them.
She took a sip of her tea, her gaze returning to the fireflies dancing in the garden. The night was quiet, but the air felt alive with possibility. For the first time in a long time, Matsuda felt a flicker of hope—not just for Haruki, but for herself as well.

            <Title>Honoka</Title>
            <Text>This is such a rich and layered character for Honoka! The contrast between her present self—a traditional housewife who encourages Haruhi to conform to societal expectations—and her younger self—a dreamer who aspired to be a writer—adds so much depth to her character and the story. It also creates a fascinating parallel between Honoka and Nagano, as both had to abandon their dreams due to societal pressures. Let’s explore Honoka’s character further and how her story intertwines with Haruhi’s journey.

Honoka’s Character Arc
Present Honoka
Personality: Kind, nurturing, and traditional, but also somewhat resigned to her role as a housewife. She genuinely cares for Haruhi but struggles to understand her daughter’s dreams.
Appearance: Neatly dressed, often in modest, feminine clothing. She carries herself with grace but has a tiredness in her eyes.
Conflict: She wants Haruhi to have a stable, “respectable” future, but her advice clashes with Haruhi’s ambitions. Her suggestions (nursing, teaching, culinary jobs) reflect her own experiences of conforming to societal expectations.
Relationship with Haruhi: They have a loving but strained relationship. Honoka tries to connect with Haruhi, but their conversations often end in arguments about Haruhi’s future.
Young Honoka
Personality: Intelligent, ambitious, and confident, but also burdened by the pressure to maintain her perfect image. She’s a dreamer at heart but hides her vulnerability behind her composed exterior.
Appearance: Always impeccably dressed in her school uniform, with a calm and elegant demeanor. She’s the kind of girl who seems untouchable but secretly longs for someone to see the real her.
Conflict: She dreams of becoming a famous writer but knows her family expects her to marry well and settle into a traditional role. She’s torn between her passion and her duty.
Dreams: She loves classical literature and writes for the school newspaper, but she knows her writing career will likely end after graduation.

How This Shapes the Story
Haruhi’s Perspective: Meeting young Honoka helps Haruhi see her mother as more than just a housewife. She realizes that Honoka’s advice comes from her own experiences of sacrificing her dreams.
Honoka’s Growth: Through Haruhi’s influence, young Honoka begins to question whether she has to give up her dreams entirely. She starts to see that there might be a way to balance her passion with societal expectations.
Thematic Depth: The story explores the societal pressures faced by women in 1950s Japan and how those pressures continue to affect future generations.

Key Scenes Involving Honoka
Haruhi’s First Conversation with Young Honoka:
Haruhi is seated next to Honoka in class, and Honoka introduces herself with a warm smile. Haruhi is struck by how different she seems from the mother she knows.
Honoka’s Secret Writing:
Haruhi discovers that Honoka writes poetry and short stories in secret, hiding them in her desk. This reveals Honoka’s inner world and her unfulfilled dreams.
The School Newspaper:
Haruhi helps Honoka with the school newspaper, bonding over their shared love of art and storytelling. This becomes a way for Haruhi to connect with her mother on a deeper level.
Honoka’s Confession:
In a heartfelt moment, Honoka tells Haruhi about her dream of becoming a writer and how she feels trapped by societal expectations. This helps Haruhi understand why her mother is so insistent on her pursuing a “stable” career.
The Festival Performance:
Honoka reads one of her poems at the school festival, inspired by Haruhi’s encouragement. This becomes a pivotal moment for both Honoka and Nagano, as they begin to see each other in a new light.
The Heartbreaking Decision:
After the festival, Honoka tells Haruhi that she’s decided to give up her dream of becoming a writer and focus on finding a suitable husband. This moment is bittersweet and mirrors the sacrifices Honoka’s present-day self has made.

How Haruhi Helps Honoka

Understanding: Through her conversations with Honoka, Haruhi learns about the pressures her mother faced and why she feels the need to conform to societal expectations.
Inspiration: Haruhi’s own passion for art inspires Honoka to take a risk and share her poetry at the school festival, even if it’s just once.

Sample Scene: Honoka’s Secret Writing
Here’s a scene where Haruhi discovers Honoka’s hidden passion for writing:

Chapter 6: The Hidden Notebook
Haruhi was rummaging through her desk, looking for a pen, when she noticed a small, leather-bound notebook tucked away in the corner. Curious, she opened it and found pages filled with elegant handwriting. Poems, short stories, and snippets of thoughts spilled across the pages, each word carefully chosen.
“That’s mine,” Honoka’s voice came from behind her, soft but firm.
Haruhi jumped, nearly dropping the notebook. “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to—”
Honoka held out her hand, and Haruhi reluctantly handed over the notebook. For a moment, Honoka looked like she might scold her, but then she sighed and sat down.
“You write?” Haruhi asked, unable to hide her curiosity.
Honoka hesitated, then nodded. “It’s… just something I do to pass the time.”
Haruhi leaned forward, her eyes shining. “But it’s amazing! You’re really talented.”
Honoka’s cheeks flushed, and she looked away. “It’s not something I can do forever. After graduation, I’ll have to focus on more important things.”
“Like what?” Haruhi asked, though she already knew the answer.
“Like finding a good husband, taking care of a family,” Honoka said, her voice tinged with resignation. “Writing is just a hobby.”
Haruhi’s chest tightened. She thought of her mother in the present, always encouraging her to be more “woman-like.” Was this why? Because Honoka had given up her dreams and didn’t want Haruhi to make the same mistake?
“It doesn’t have to be just a hobby,” Haruhi said firmly. “You could be a famous writer someday.”
Honoka smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Maybe in another life.”

            <Title>Chapter 1 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The distant chirping of sparrows, filled the evening.
Sounds of brass musical instruments. Trombones, Tubas, Trumpets, somewhere across the school yard, practicing.
The rhythmic scratching of a paintbrush against canvas filled the small art room, each stroke deliberate, each movement lost in the rhythm of creation. The room smelled of acrylics and turpentine, a scent that Haruki had come to associate with freedom—a freedom she rarely felt outside these four walls.
In the center of the room stood a girl, her figure silhouetted by the golden light of the setting sun streaming through the window. Haruki Fujiyama, her dark hair tied loosely in a ponytail, stood before an easel, her paintbrush moving almost instinctively across the canvas. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, her lips pressed into a thin line as she lost herself in the world she was creating. 
To anyone watching, it might have seemed like she was painting a landscape or a portrait, but to Haruki, it was something more. It was a world—a world where the colors bled into each other like emotions, where the lines blurred between reality and imagination. A world where she could be anything.
She stepped back for a moment, tilting her head as she studied her work. The painting was abstract, a swirl of blues and purples with streaks of gold cutting through like sunlight breaking through a storm. It wasn’t perfect—nothing ever was—but it was hers. 
For a fleeting moment, she wondered if such a place could exist. A place where she didn’t have to argue with her father about art school, where her mother didn’t gently suggest she consider a “more practical” career. A place where she could just be, without the weight of expectations pressing down on her shoulders.
Her brush hovered over the canvas as her thoughts drifted. What would it be like to live in a world where her dreams weren’t just dreams? Where she could paint all day, every day, and no one would tell her it was a waste of time? Where her father’s stern face would soften with pride instead of disappointment? She sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. Maybe such a world only existed in her paintings. Maybe it was foolish to hope for anything more.

Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, the door behind her creaked open, pulling her back to reality. The sound of footsteps and the faint jingle of a charm bracelet broke the silence.
“Haruki-chan!” a sing-songy voice called out, bright and cheerful. “There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”
Haruki didn’t hear Aiko at first. Her mind was still lost in the world of her painting, far removed from the Art Club room. She was thinking about the shadows—how they should fall, how they should interact with the light. Should the reds be warmer? Did the greens clash? She murmured to herself, her brush hovering uncertainly over the canvas. “Maybe if I add a touch of ochre here…”
Aiko, standing by the door with her hands on her hips, frowned when Haruki didn’t respond. 
“Haruki-chan!” she called again, louder this time. Still, Haruki didn’t turn. Aiko sighed, her shoulders slumping in mock dejection. “Fine, be that way,” she muttered under her breath, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.
Quietly, Aiko tiptoed across the room, her sneakers making no sound on the wooden floor. She crept up behind Haruki, her hands poised to strike. 
Then, with a dramatic flourish, she clapped her hands on Haruki’s shoulders and shouted, “Boo!”
Haruki jumped, her paintbrush slipping from her fingers and smearing a streak of green across the canvas. 
“Aiko!” she exclaimed, spinning around to glare at her friend. “What was that for?!”
Aiko burst into laughter, doubling over as Haruki scowled. “You should’ve seen your face!” she wheezed, clutching her stomach. “Priceless!”
Haruki sighed, shaking her head as she turned back to her painting. She picked up a painting knife and began carefully scraping away the smeared paint. “You’re impossible, you know that? I was in the middle of something.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Aiko said, still giggling. She stepped closer, peering over Haruki’s shoulder at the painting. “Whatcha painting there, Picasso?”
Haruki didn’t look up, her focus returning to the canvas. “Komorebi,” she said simply. “I need practice painting light.”
Aiko tilted her head, studying the painting. It was a tree, its leaves dappled with sunlight that seemed to shimmer even in its unfinished state. “Whoa, that’s awesome!” she said, her voice dripping with mock enthusiasm. “Is the light going to be brighter than your future?”
Haruki chuckled despite herself, shaking her head. “Don’t be silly. It’s just a painting. Why the question?”
Aiko’s grin faded slightly, and she reached into her bag, pulling out a folded sheet of paper. “Mrs. Kitagawa has been nagging me all day to remind you to fill out your Career Plans paper. You’re one of the few who hasn’t done it yet.” She held out the paper, which was slightly crumpled at the edges. “You left this at your desk this morning.”
Haruki’s smile faltered as she looked at the paper. “Oh, yeah,” she said quietly, setting down her painting knife. She peeled off her paint-stained gloves and apron, then took the paper from Aiko. The words “Career Plans” were printed in bold letters at the top, and the sight of them made her stomach twist.
“So, have you thought of any?” Aiko asked, leaning casually against the table. Her tone was light, but her eyes were curious, searching Haruki’s face for an answer.
Haruki sighed, setting the Career Plans paper down on the table. “No… I’m not sure.”
Aiko raised an eyebrow. “Why not art school? Tokyo University has the best art program. Why not go there?”
Haruki’s shoulders slumped, and she turned back to her painting, picking up her brush again as if to distract herself. “You know my dad,” she said quietly. “He’d rather I become a doctor or something ‘respectable’ than go there.”
Aiko frowned, crossing her arms. “Why not? Didn’t one of the seniors from Art Club go there?” She tapped her chin, trying to remember. “I think she used to be the vice president of the Art Club back when we were first-years.”
Haruki paused, her brush hovering over the canvas. “Matsuda-senpai?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Yeah! Yaeko Matsuda!” Aiko said, snapping her fingers. “Her paintings were gorgeous. Didn’t she go to Tokyo University to pursue fine arts?”
Haruki fell silent, her expression darkening. The room seemed to grow colder, the cheerful chatter of the brass band outside fading into the background. She set her brush down and turned to face Aiko, her eyes serious.
“Didn’t you know, Aiko?” Haruki asked, her voice low.
Aiko blinked, confused. “Know what?”
“Yaeko Matsuda went missing just before graduation,” Haruki said, her tone heavy. “I don’t think she ever made it to Tokyo.”
Aiko’s eyes widened. “What do you mean? I thought she did.”
Haruki shook her head. “Nobody knows. Not even the senpais have heard from her since then. It’s like she just… vanished.”
Aiko’s playful demeanor vanished, replaced by a look of unease. “Are you implying that she—?”
“It could be…” Haruki trailed off, her gaze distant. The weight of her words hung in the air, thick and suffocating.
For a moment, neither of them spoke. The only sound was the faint scratching of Haruki’s brush as she absentmindedly touched up her painting. The tension in the room was palpable, as if the ghost of Yaeko Matsuda herself had stepped into the Art Club room.
Finally, Haruki broke the silence. “Sorry to make the situation tense,” she said, forcing a small smile. She chuckled softly, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I’ll tidy up for a bit, then I’ll meet you at the bicycle park.”
Aiko nodded, her usual cheerfulness returning, though it felt a little forced. “Okay!” she said in her sing-songy voice. But as she turned to leave, she paused at the doorframe, glancing back at Haruki. “Hey, Haruki-chan,” she said, her tone softer now. “Have you thought of any career path, just off the top of your head?”
Haruki tilted her head, confused. “Off the top of my head—?”
“Quick! Answer, no time!” Aiko teased, her grin returning.
Haruki hesitated for a moment, then smiled. “Art school,” she said firmly. “That’s what’s on the top of my head.”
Aiko’s smile widened, and she gave Haruki a thumbs-up. “Then write it on your paper and submit it before Mrs. Kitagawa continues nagging me about it!”
Haruki laughed, the tension in the room finally dissipating. “I will, I will. Now go on, I’ll catch up.”
As Aiko disappeared down the hallway, her footsteps echoing faintly, Haruki turned back to her painting. The komorebi—the sunlight filtering through the leaves—seemed to glow brighter now, as if reflecting the spark of determination in her heart. She picked up her brush and added a few more strokes, her movements steady and sure.</Text>

            <Text>“Dad?” he repeated, Nagano’s grin faltered, replaced by a look of confusion.  his tone incredulous. “What are you talking about? I’m not your dad.”
Haruki shook her head, trying to clear the fog in her mind. “No, I mean… you’re…” She trailed off, unsure how to explain. How could she tell him that she was his daughter from the future? He would never believe her.
Nagano tilted his head, studying her with a mixture of curiosity and concern. “Are you feeling okay?” he asked. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Haruki forced a weak smile, though her heart was still racing. “I’m… I’m fine,” she said, though her voice betrayed her. “I just… I think I need to sit down.”
Nagano nodded, his easygoing demeanor returning. “Alright, let’s find a place to sit. You look like you’ve had a rough morning.”
As they walked, Haruki’s mind was a whirlwind of emotions. She had found her father—or rather, the boy who would one day become her father. But he was so different from the man she knew. So… alive. So full of life.
And yet, the thought of what lay ahead for him—for both of them—filled her with a deep, aching sadness. She didn’t know how, but she had to find a way to change things. To make sure that the boy in front of her didn’t lose the light in his eyes.
But for now, all she could do was follow him, her heart heavy with the weight of the future.

-o-

Haruki sat on a piece of concrete pipe, her legs dangling as she watched the boys play a makeshift game of baseball. There were four of them, their laughter loud and carefree as they swung bats and chased after the ball. Nearby, four motorcycles were parked, their sleek designs a stark contrast to the simplicity of the game.
The girl sitting next to her—a cheerful, dark-haired girl with a bright smile—handed her a carton of apple juice. Haruki took it, glancing at the unfamiliar brand name before sticking the straw in and taking a sip. It was sweet and refreshing, a small comfort in the midst of her confusion.
The girl opened her mouth to start a conversation, but Haruki interrupted her, her words slightly muffled by the straw in her mouth. “If you turned out to be Honoka Fujiyama… I’m going to lose my mind.”
The girl blinked, her brow furrowing in confusion. “Honoka Fujiyama?” she repeated. “You mean Honoka Aoki from Class 1A?”
Haruki froze, the carton of juice halfway to her mouth. Aoki. That was her mother’s maiden name. Of course. Her mother hadn’t taken her father’s surname yet. She was still Honoka Aoki in this time.
The girl tilted her head, studying Haruki with a curious expression. “What’s your name, by the way? I’m Sakura Emasu.”
Haruki hesitated, her mind racing. “Haruki… Haruki Fujiyama,” she said finally, her voice quiet.
Sakura’s eyes widened in surprise. “Oh, are you and Naga-kun related?” she asked, gesturing toward Nagano, who was currently arguing with one of the other boys over a questionable call.
Haruki stared at her, her frustration bubbling to the surface. She didn’t know how to answer that question. Was she related to him? Technically, yes. But how could she explain that to someone who had no idea about the future—about who Nagano would become, about who she was?
Without a word, Haruki stood up, crumpled the empty juice carton in her hand, and threw it toward a nearby trash can. It missed, bouncing off the rim and landing on the ground. “I don’t know!” she said, her voice tinged with frustration.
Sakura blinked, taken aback by Haruki’s outburst. “Uh… okay,” she said slowly, her tone cautious. “You don’t have to get mad about it.”
Haruki sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I’m not mad,” she said, though her voice still carried an edge. “I’m just… confused.”
Sakura studied her for a moment, then shrugged. “Well, if you say so. But you know, Naga-kun’s a good guy. If you’re related, you’re lucky.”
Haruki didn’t respond. She just sat back down, her eyes fixed on Nagano as he laughed and joked with his friends. He was so different from the man she knew—so carefree, so full of life. It was hard to believe that this was the same person who would one day become her stern, distant father.
As she watched him, a strange mix of emotions swirled inside her—frustration, sadness, and a flicker of something she couldn’t quite name. Hope, maybe. Or determination.
She didn’t know how she had ended up here, or why, but she knew one thing for sure: she wasn’t going to waste this chance. She was going to find out what had happened to her parents—to these versions of them—and maybe, just maybe, she could change things.

-o-

As they hung out, the faint sound of a bell echoed in the distance, cutting through the laughter and chatter. One of the boys—a tall, lanky kid with a mischievous grin—shouted, “It’s the class bell! Let’s go!”
The others scrambled into action, quickly packing up their baseball gear and rushing toward their motorcycles. Nagano slung his glove over his shoulder and jogged toward his bike, his movements quick and practiced.
“C’mon, let’s go! The class is starting!” Sakura called, already running toward one of the motorcycles. Haruki hesitated for a moment, then followed, her heart pounding as she tried to keep up.
Sakura hopped onto the seat behind one of the boys, her arms wrapping around his waist as the engine roared to life. The other boys followed suit, their motorcycles growling like restless beasts.
“Hey! Haruki!” Nagano’s voice cut through the noise, and she turned to see him sitting on his motorcycle, his helmet already on. He grinned at her, patting the seat behind him. “C’mon, you don’t want to be late on your first day at Fukumitsu, do you?”
Haruki stared at him for a moment, her mind racing. This was surreal. She was about to ride a motorcycle with her father—her young father—to a school that existed decades before she was born. But there was no time to think. The other motorcycles were already pulling away, their engines roaring as they sped down the road.
She took a deep breath and ran toward Nagano, hopping onto the seat behind him. Her arms instinctively wrapped around his waist as he revved the engine, the vibrations coursing through her.
“Hold on tight!” he called over his shoulder, his voice barely audible over the noise. Before she could respond, he hit the throttle, and the motorcycle surged forward.
The wind whipped through Haruki’s hair as they sped down the road, the world blurring around her. She clung to Nagano, her heart racing as they weaved through the streets. The other motorcycles were ahead of them, their riders laughing and shouting as they raced toward the school.
Haruki’s mind was a whirlwind of emotions—fear, excitement, disbelief. She was riding through 1960s Japan on a motorcycle with her father, heading to a school that shouldn’t exist in this time. It was like something out of a dream, but the feel of the wind on her face and the rumble of the engine beneath her told her it was real.
As they approached the school, Nagano slowed down, pulling into the parking lot alongside the others. He cut the engine and turned to Haruki, his grin wide and carefree. “Not bad for your first ride, huh?”
Haruki nodded, her legs trembling slightly as she climbed off the motorcycle. “Yeah… not bad.”
Nagano laughed, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “C’mon, let’s get to class. You don’t want to miss your first day.”
Haruki followed him, her mind still reeling. She didn’t know what to expect, but one thing was clear: this was just the beginning. She was in the past, surrounded by people who would one day shape her future. And she had no idea what to do next.
But for now, all she could do was follow Nagano, her heart pounding with a mix of fear and determination.</Text>

            <Text>“You’ll need to get your parents to be together” Yaeko said

“But why?” Haruki said, “Does whatever it is locking me in here does that to just so I can play match making?”

“Well no,” Yaeko said, “It’s not just any match-making, but you’ve got to do it now, otherwise you’ll end up like me.”

“Like you?”

“My parents never got together, meaning I was never born in the next timeline.” Yaeko said, “I cannot go back to my time, because there is no ‘Me’ in the future, there is only me here.”

“So does that mean…”

“Haruki,” Yaeko said, “Your father will be forced to take the position of a chairman, your mother will be forced to study relentlessly to become a teacher. Their only chance to meet is this summer.”

“If you didn’t get them together by this summer,” Yaeko said, “I’m afraid it’ll be too late for you

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose either of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “All files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>Chapter 2 RAW V3</Title>
            <Text>The school gates cast long shadows across the bicycle racks as Haruki wheeled her bike out, the chain clicking softly in time with her steps. Aiko and Akihito fell into stride beside her—Aiko bouncing on her toes with barely-contained curiosity, Akihito adjusting his glasses with his usual calm.
Haruki hummed a tuneless melody, her lips curled into a smirk that made Aiko narrow her eyes.
&quot;So?&quot; Aiko prodded, swinging her bag like a pendulum. &quot;What did Mrs. Matsuoka want? Career Plan interrogation? Tomorrow's plein air logistics? Or just her usual lavender tea torture session?&quot;
Haruki's smirk widened. She brought a finger to her lips. &quot;S.e.c.r.e.t.&quot; She drew out each letter, popping the 't' with relish.
Aiko's bag hit the pavement with a thud. &quot;Haruki.&quot; She planted herself in front of the bike, blocking their path. &quot;As your vice-president—no, as your friend—I demand full disclosure!&quot; She jabbed a finger at Akihito. &quot;And he does too, right?&quot;
Akihito sighed, though the corner of his mouth twitched. &quot;I'm merely here to ensure you two don't cause a scene.&quot;
Haruki laughed, the sound bright against the quiet hum of cicadas. Then—with a sudden burst of energy—she kicked off on her bike, sailing past Aiko in a blur of motion.
&quot;Hey!&quot; Aiko scrambled after her, sandals slapping against the pavement. Akihito followed at a more dignified pace, though his long strides kept him close.
Haruki skidded to a stop a few meters ahead, the evening sun setting her dark curls ablaze. She leaned forward, her hair tumbling like a cascade of ink as she grinned back at them. The golden light outlined her silhouette, painting the edges of her uniform in fire.
&quot;I know what to put in my Career Plans paper,&quot; she announced, voice brimming with a confidence that hadn't been there an hour ago.
Aiko froze mid-step. Even Akihito's eyebrows lifted.
Haruki didn't wait for their reaction. With a final, triumphant laugh, she pushed off again, her bike cutting through the sunset-drenched path like an arrow released from a bow. Behind her, Aiko's indignant screech echoed across the schoolyard—
&quot;Haruki Fujiyama, you get back here right now!&quot;

-o-

The sky was a deep shade of purple, streaked with the last remnants of orange as the sun dipped below the horizon. Haruki pedaled her bicycle alongside Aiko and Akihito, the cool evening air brushing against her face. The streets were quiet, save for the occasional hum of a passing car or the distant laughter of children playing in a nearby park. Their conversation drifted between idle chatter and the lingering weight of their discussion in the art room, though none of them spoke about Matsuda again.
Eventually, they reached the point where their paths diverged. Aiko stretched her arms above her head before turning down her street. “See you tomorrow, Haruki-chan! Don’t forget to submit that paper!”
Haruki laughed lightly. “I won’t! See you!”
As Aiko disappeared around the corner, Haruki turned her bike toward her own street, only to hear Akihito clear his throat beside her.
“Seriously, Haruki, you haven’t forgotten, right?” He adjusted his grip on the handlebars, casting her a skeptical glance. “You know Mrs. Kitagawa won’t go easy on you just because you’re the Art Club’s Vice President.”
Haruki huffed, rolling her eyes. “I know, I know. I’ll finish it when I get home.”
“Just making sure.” Akihito smirked before pedaling ahead, calling back over his shoulder, “I better not hear you complaining about an extension tomorrow!”
Haruki waved with a small smile, watching him disappear down the street before resuming her ride home. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and distant food stalls. 
She continued on her way, the rhythmic sound of her bicycle wheels against the pavement filling the silence. Soon, she turned onto a tree-lined street, where the houses grew larger and more imposing. Her own home stood at the end of the road, a traditional Japanese estate that exuded both elegance and isolation. The wooden gate creaked softly as she pushed it open, and she wheeled her bicycle into the garage, the dim light casting long shadows across the empty space.
The house itself was grand, with a sloping tiled roof and a meticulously maintained garden that seemed almost too perfect, as if it had been frozen in time. The sliding doors were made of polished wood, and the paper screens glowed faintly with the warm light from inside. Despite its beauty, the house often felt cold and empty, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath.
Haruki slipped off her shoes at the entrance, placing them neatly on the shoe rack. She glanced at the other pairs—her father’s polished leather shoes were absent, as usual, but her mother’s modest flats were there. She was home early today.
“I’m back,” Haruki called out, her voice echoing through the spacious hallway. The house seemed to swallow her words, leaving only silence in their wake.
Haruki stepped into the house, the polished wooden floors cool beneath her socks. She closed the door softly behind her, careful not to make too much noise. The last thing she wanted was to draw her mother’s attention. She was tired, her shoulders heavy from the day, and all she wanted was to retreat to her room and lose herself in her sketchbook.
She tiptoed through the hallway, her footsteps barely audible. To her left was the open doorframe leading to the kitchen and dining area. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her mother sitting at the dining table, still in her tailored suit from work. Her laptop was open in front of her, its screen casting a faint glow on her face. Stacks of papers—student assignments waiting to be graded—were piled neatly beside her. Her mother’s glasses perched low on her nose as she scribbled notes in the margins of a worksheet.
Good, Haruki thought, relief washing over her. She’s busy. Now’s my chance to slip through.
She quickened her pace, her hand already reaching for the banister of the stairs. But just as her foot touched the first step, her mother’s voice cut through the silence.
“Haruki?” Her tone was stern and steady, the kind of voice that brooked no argument. “Come talk with me at the dining table.”
Haruki froze, her heart sinking. She closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath to steady herself. “Yes, Mom,” she said, forcing her voice to sound neutral.
She turned and walked into the dining area, her shoulders tense. Her mother didn’t look up immediately, her pen still moving across the paper. Haruki stood awkwardly by the table, her hands clasped behind her back, waiting.
Finally, her mother set down her pen and removed her glasses, setting them carefully on the table, her nametag written “Honoka Fujiyama” is still etched on her tailored suit. She looked up at Haruki, her expression unreadable. “How was school?” she asked, her voice calm but probing.
“It was fine,” Haruki replied, her tone clipped. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, avoiding her mother’s gaze.
There was a brief silence between the two, broken only by the occasional click-clacking of her mother’s laptop keys. The sound was sharp and deliberate, each keystroke echoing in the quiet room. Haruki stood awkwardly, her hands fidgeting behind her back, wishing she could just disappear upstairs.
Then her mother took a quick glance away from her laptop, her eyes narrowing as she noticed something on Haruki’s uniform and face. “What is that on your uniform and face?” she asked, her voice tinged with disapproval.
Haruki blinked, caught off guard. She looked down at her sleeve, where streaks of red and green paint had dried into a messy splatter. Her fingers instinctively brushed her cheek, and she felt the faint crust of paint there too. “Oh,” she said, surprised. “It’s just paint…”
Her mother sighed, setting down her pen and removing her glasses. “Have you been painting again in that club of yours?”
“Yes, Mom,” Haruki said, her voice steady but defensive. “I’m the vice president of the club now, so I have to keep it running.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest. “You know…” she began, her tone softening but still firm, “you’re in your third year now. You’re about to finish high school. You can’t keep getting lost in your head anymore. One day, you’ll need to go to university, get a job, and support yourself.”
Haruki stayed silent, her jaw tightening. Inside, her heart was a storm of emotions. She wanted to argue, to shout that she could keep getting lost in her head, that she could make a living as an artist, that she could decide her own future. She was tired of being told what to do, tired of feeling like her dreams were nothing more than childish fantasies. But the words stuck in her throat, heavy and unspoken.
All she could muster was another quiet, “Yes, Mom.”
Her mother’s gaze lingered on her for a moment longer before she turned back to her laptop. The click-clacking of the keys resumed, filling the silence. But then her mother paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, and looked up again. “Have you received your Career Plan papers yet?” she asked, her tone casual but probing. “You should have gotten one by now.”
Haruki hesitated, then nodded. “Yes, I did.” She reached into her bag and pulled out the folded sheet of paper, holding it out reluctantly.
Her mother took it, scanning the form with a critical eye. “You should consider becoming a nurse, Haruki,” she said, her voice matter-of-fact. “The pay is good, and you said you don’t want to become a doctor. I think nursing would suit you.”
Haruki’s stomach twisted. She clenched her hands into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. “B-but I don’t want to become a nurse either, Mom,” she said, her voice trembling slightly.
Her mother’s eyes narrowed, and she set the paper down on the table. “Then what do you want to be?” she asked, her tone sharp.
There was a heavy silence between them, the air thick with tension. Haruki’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing. She knew what she wanted to say, but the words felt like a betrayal, like they would shatter the fragile peace between them. Still, she couldn’t hold it in any longer.
“I want to go to art school,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. “I want to become an artist.”
The room fell silent, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Her mother stared at her, her expression unreadable. For a moment, Haruki thought she might not have heard her. But then her mother’s lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes hardened.
“What?” her mother said finally, her voice low and incredulous.
Haruki flinched but stood her ground. “I want to go to art school,” she repeated, her voice firmer this time. “I want to study art and become an artist.”
Her mother leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest. “An artist?” she said, her tone dripping with disbelief. “Haruki, do you hear yourself? Do you have any idea how difficult it is to make a living as an artist? How unstable that kind of life is?”
“I know it’s not easy,” Haruki said, her voice rising slightly. “But it’s what I love. It’s what I’m good at. I don’t want to spend my life doing something I hate just because it’s ‘stable.’”
Her mother’s eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her voice calm, which somehow made it worse. “You’re being naive, Haruki. Dreams don’t pay the bills. You need to think about your future, about how you’re going to support yourself.”
“I am thinking about my future!” Haruki shot back, her voice breaking. “I’m thinking about what makes me happy, not just what makes you happy!”
The words hung in the air, sharp and unyielding. Haruki’s chest heaved as she stared at her mother, her eyes burning with unshed tears. Her mother’s expression softened for a moment, but then she sighed and shook her head.
“You’ll understand one day,” she said, her voice tired. “When you’re older, you’ll see that I’m only trying to protect you.”
Haruki didn’t respond. She couldn’t. The lump in her throat was too big, the weight of her mother’s words too heavy. She turned and walked out of the dining room, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. As she climbed the stairs, her vision blurred with tears, but she blinked them away, refusing to let them fall.
When she reached her room, she closed the door behind her and leaned against it, sliding down to the floor. Her sketchbook lay on her desk, its pages filled with drawings and paintings that felt like pieces of her soul. She stared at it, her heart aching.
After a moment, she stood up and walked over to her desk, where her Career Plans paper lay crumpled at the edge. She smoothed it out, her fingers trembling slightly as she picked up a pen. Her mind raced, but for the first time in a long time, it felt clear. She knew what she wanted. She had always known.
With a deep breath, she wrote in neat, deliberate letters: Tokyo University Fine Arts Program.
Her hand shook as she set the pen down, but her resolve was steady. This was her choice. Her future. And no one—not her mother, not her father, not anyone—was going to take it away from her.
She stared at the paper for a long moment, the words staring back at her like a declaration of war. It was a small act of defiance, but it felt monumental. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt a flicker of hope.
“I’ll show them,” she whispered to herself, her voice trembling but determined. “I’ll prove them wrong.”
She folded the paper carefully and placed it back in her bag, ready to submit it tomorrow. As she sat down at her desk and opened her sketchbook, her heart felt lighter. The colors on the page seemed brighter, the lines sharper, as if they too were emboldened by her decision.
For now, all she could do was keep painting, keep dreaming. But this time, it felt different. This time, it felt like the beginning of something new.

            <Title>Chapter 26 RAW</Title>
            <Text>The cabin’s twin doors loomed before Haruki, their weathered wood groaning as she pushed with all her weight. Still, they refused to budge—not even a crack of light from the other side. A spider skittered away from her fingers, its web trembling between the doorframes like a bridge between worlds.
&quot;It still won’t open,&quot; Haruki whispered, pressing her forehead against the grain. The wood smelled of pine and something older, something that made her teeth ache with déjà vu.
Behind her, Matsuda snapped her suitcase shut with finality. &quot;Of course not,&quot; she said, adjusting her wide-brimmed hat. Sunlight sliced through the cabin’s dusty windows, striping the floor between them. &quot;The task was never about making them friends*, Haruki-chan. It’s about forging a bond strong enough to* create you*.&quot;*
Haruki turned. Matsuda’s luggage was an artifact of another era—a leather trunk plastered with peeling steamship stickers from Marseille, Naples, ports Haruki only knew from history books. A paint-stained smock peeked from the top.
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Haruki asked.
Matsuda hefted the trunk with a grunt. &quot;Kyoto. Some bureaucrat wants a mural of cherry blossoms in his office.&quot; She smirked. &quot;Apparently my ‘melancholic style’ suits his midlife crisis.&quot;
The weight of those words settled over Haruki like dusk. Matsuda’s luggage sat between them—a leather-bound confession of permanence. If Haruki succeeded, if those doors finally swung open to spit her back into her own time… Matsuda would remain here. A woman out of era, her paintings the only proof she’d ever existed at all.
&quot;Will we meet again, Matsuda-senpai?&quot; The question slipped out before Haruki could stop it, thin and fragile as the spiderweb trembling between the doorframes.
Sunlight pooled at Matsuda’s feet, gilding the dust motes that swirled around her. For a moment, she looked every bit the timeless artist—the smock, the hat, the knowing curve of her smile.
&quot;I suppose we will,&quot; she said, adjusting her grip on the trunk. &quot;In the future. Fifty years later.&quot;
Then she turned fully, her long hair—still ink-black despite the years she’d lived in this past—cascading over one shoulder. The smile she offered Haruki then was softer at the edges, the kind reserved for shared secrets and goodbyes.
&quot;Though you’ll be calling me Matsuda-obaachan then.&quot;
Before she could second-guess herself, Haruki hurled forward—crashing into Matsuda with enough force to make the older woman stumble back a step. Her fingers clutched at the rough fabric of Matsuda's smock, inhaling the familiar scents of oil paint and chamomile that clung to her like a second skin.
&quot;Haruki…,&quot; Matsuda murmured, but her arms came up anyway, one hand cradling the back of Haruki's head like she was something precious. Her paint-stained fingers tangled in Haruki's hair. &quot;You'll make me miss my train.&quot;
&quot;I'll miss you,&quot; Haruki mumbled into her shoulder, her voice thick. The words vibrated against Matsuda's collarbone. 
Matsuda's chuckle rumbled through both of them. &quot;Then make it worth waiting for.&quot; She pulled back just enough to cup Haruki's face, thumbs brushing away tears Haruki hadn't realized had fallen. Her dark eyes were fierce. 
&quot;Keep your strength. Be strong. Keep painting and drawing—even when it feels impossible.&quot; A pause, then softer: &quot;Especially then.&quot;
The afternoon light caught the silver streaks in Matsuda's otherwise black hair—proof of years spent in this wrong time. Haruki memorized the way it looked, like captured starlight.
&quot;I wish—&quot; Haruki began, but Matsuda pressed a finger to her lips.
&quot;No wishes. Only promises.&quot; Her mouth curved. &quot;Become an artist you’ve meant to be. That's all the goodbye I need.&quot;
When Matsuda finally stepped away, the space between them thrummed with unspoken words. The cabin door creaked in the breeze—an impatient reminder.
Haruki stood rooted as Matsuda hoisted her trunk, the sunlight haloing her form. For one impossible moment, she looked both young and ancient all at once—the girl who'd stepped through time, and the woman who'd learned to make peace with it.
Then she turned, her sandals crunching on the gravel path, and didn't look back.
