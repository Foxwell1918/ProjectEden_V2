            <Title>Opening Scene V2</Title>
            <Text>This… is Berk. Well, New Berk.
It’s twelve days north of Hopeless, and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. 
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.
My village. In a word, sturdy. 
And it’s been here for exactly one generation. 
I know, because we are the first one. 
We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. 
The only real problem we have…
 is the dragons.
I don’t mean the actual creature, but how people here think of them.
Most people would call it our strength. My father, the chief, Hiccup the Rider certainly does. He calls it the “Heart of the Dragon.” It’s this idea that we aren't just Vikings anymore. We are meant to embody the spirit of the creatures we once lived alongside. It sounds noble, I guess. In practice, it’s just plain weird.
And who me? I’m Zephyr. While the other kids my age are out in the training rings, learning to be fierce warriors and explorers to earn their &quot;Dragon Heart,&quot; I’m here. In the forge. 
I’m the town’s youngest blacksmith, taught by the one and only Old Man Gobber. In here, surrounded by the heat and the hiss of cooling metal, I get to breathe fire and melt steel. What difference does it make? 
My fire is real.
&quot;Easy... easy now, lass,&quot; Gobber’s gravelly voice coached from over my shoulder. &quot;Don't force it. Let the teeth find their groove.&quot;
Everything was focused on the gearbox. It was my design, the heart of the new grain mill, and I was holding the very last piece. This tiny, perfect cog. All I had to do was slot it in. The whole forge was quiet. I ignored the sweat dripping down my face and just... gently... eased it into place. Click 
Silence. Then, a loud whoop echoed through the forge.
&quot;HA! She's done it!&quot; Gobber hopped from his good foot to his peg leg, a joyous, lopsided dance that threatened to knock over a rack of tongs. He clapped me on the shoulder with a hand like a solid slab of granite. &quot;It works! By Thor's mighty hammer, the lass did it!&quot;
“It was a bit difficult,” I said, “But still definitely doable.”
&quot;Haha! Yer reminds me of yer father when he's just a wee lad,&quot; Gobber said, beaming, his mustache bristling with pride.
&quot;Aww, do you mean that?&quot; I said, my voice muffled. I reached up and flipped open the heavy welding mask, letting cool air wash over my face. 
But a stray wisp of my auburn braid, which had escaped its tight binding, chose that exact moment to drift too close to the forge's embers. It sizzled, a tiny curl of orange flame racing up the strand. 
&quot;Ah! Not again!&quot; I yelped, frantically patting it out with a gloved hand. I sighed, looking at the singed ends. &quot;Wait,&quot; I said, turning back to Gobber. &quot;Is that a good thing or a bad thing?&quot;
&quot;Could be either,&quot; Gobber chuckled, leaning his bulk against a workbench. He looked me over, his expression softening. &quot;He had the same knack for makin' the impossible possible. And the same knack for nearly settin' himself on fire doin' it.&quot; He paused, stroking his chin. &quot;But there is one more thing… somethin' yer mother gave ya.&quot;
&quot;And that is?&quot;
Gobber’s eyes twinkled with mischief.
&quot;Yer stubborn as a bull.&quot;
&quot;Hey, come on!&quot; I protested, putting my hands on my hips. The heat from my face had nothing to do with the forge this time. &quot;That was uncalled for! Why are you calling me out all of a sudden?&quot;
Gobber let out a hearty chuckle, but it ended in a bit of a wheeze. He held up his hands in surrender, the gesture of a man backing down. &quot;Alright, alright, lass. A truce.&quot; He leaned against the workbench for a moment, his breath heavy, before his eyes landed on a sturdy-looking crate.
He looked at me then, his expression turning serious, the playful twinkle in his eyes replaced by a genuine concern that I found far more unnerving.
&quot;So,&quot; he began, his voice now quiet and even. &quot;I hear the other children your age are makin' their final preparations. Packing their ships, sayin' their goodbyes... The Venture, the Sea Serpent… even that rickety little boat Snotlout’s boy cobbled together. All ready for the Journey.&quot; He let the statement hang in the air between us. &quot;Are you not?&quot;
My stomach tightened. I turned my back to him, busying myself with the gearbox again, pretending to inspect the fit of the cogs I had just placed. My fortress of solitude was being breached.
&quot;I said I'm not going,&quot; I stated, my voice coming out firmer than I felt. I fitted a small wrench to a bolt, making a show of testing its tightness.
The rhythmic thump-hiss of the forge's great bellows filled the silence for a long moment before Gobber spoke again.
&quot;Zephyr,&quot; he said, and the gentleness in his tone made me stop turning the wrench. &quot;The Coming of Age Journey… it's important for ye. It's how we grow. It's how we've always grown. It’s a Berkian tradition.&quot;
I scoffed, finally turning to face him and planting the wrench on my hip. &quot;Tradition? Gobber, Dad came up with this 'journey' idea last winter after a bad batch of yak nog. It’s not a tradition, it’s a new policy he came up with.&quot;
Gobber sighed, the sound of an old man who had argued with two generations of Haddocks. &quot;And it will be a tradition, lass. Every road needs someone to pave the path first. Our identity as Vikings isn't about killing dragons anymore, nor is it about riding them.&quot; He leaned forward, his voice low and intense. &quot;It's about keeping them in our hearts. It's about applying what we've learned from them to become better people.&quot;
I let out a groan that felt like it carried all the smoke in the forge. I threw my hands up. &quot;Why are you guys so obsessed with this stuff, anyway?&quot; I gestured around us, at the solid, real things—the bellows, the anvil, the glowing embers. &quot;Nobody has seen a dragon for decades. All I know about them are stories. Bedside stories! And if the old books are to be believed, they were bloodthirsty monsters! So why would anyone want the 'heart' of one of those?&quot;
&quot;Because the lesson is real, even if they aren't here,&quot; Gobber said, his voice firm, cutting through my frustration. &quot;They don't need to exist right now, lass. Not for the longest time, maybe. But they taught us something. They taught us to be brave, to be loyal, to look past the surface.&quot; He pointed a thick finger at me. &quot;Your father nearly died paving the road for us to learn that lesson. You need to believe in that.&quot;
His words hit me like a hammer striking cold iron. I was stunned into silence, my mouth open but no counter-argument forming. My logic had no defense against that kind of appeal, against the weight of my father's past.
Before I could even try to respond, a voice rang out from the bright square beyond the forge's gloom.
&quot;Zeph!&quot;
I knew that voice better than my own. I let out an internal sigh. 
My brother, Nuffink. I swear Dad still believed in that old Viking tradition that ugly names scare off gnomes and trolls, so he named his son after the word 'Nothing.' The joke was on him. 
Nuffink had everything a Viking could ask for. A chief as a father, He was the best fighter of our generation, a natural leader, and every kid in the village idolized him. He walked around like he truly had the Heart of the Dragon beating in his chest. I wouldn't be surprised if, one day, the village chose him as the next chief, even though I'm the older child.
I turned towards the doorway, raising my voice. &quot;Hey, Nuff. What's up?&quot;
His silhouette filled the entrance, blocking the light. &quot;It's the mainsail winch,&quot; he said, his voice laced with an annoyance that suggested it was the winch's fault, not his. &quot;The gear mechanism is stuck. I need you to fix it.&quot;
&quot;Again?&quot; I groaned, grabbing a rag to wipe the grease from my hands. &quot;I told you to be careful with that stuff! It’s a winch, not a battering ram!&quot;
He just shrugged, the universal sibling gesture for &quot;not my problem.&quot;
I looked back at Gobber, who was watching the exchange with a knowing, slightly amused look. I gave him a small nod. &quot;I have to go.&quot;
I unhooked my heavy leather apron, letting it fall onto the crate Gobber had vacated. Without another word, I followed my brother's broad back out of the darkness of the forge and into the blinding light of a world I was still trying to figure out.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font of
their house. This PDF file was generated via Scrivener's compile
feature and was created from the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all
caps about halfway down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word
from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).

         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                 Chapter Two

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert
&gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the
word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit
&gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100--this
feature is used on the title page of this manuscript, in fact).

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

My fire is real.
&quot;Easy... easy now, lass,&quot; Gobber’s gravelly voice coached from over my shoulder. &quot;Don't force it. Let the teeth find their groove.&quot;
My world had shrunk to the space between my fingertips. Before me lay the metal heart of the new grain mill, a complex gearbox of my own design. I held the final, crucial piece—a small, dense cog with precisely measured teeth. The air was thick with the smell of coal and sweat. I ignored the trickle of perspiration running down my temple and gently, carefully, slotted the cog into place. It slid into the complex lattice of gears with a soft, satisfying click.
Silence. Then, a loud whoop echoed through the forge.
&quot;HA! She's done it!&quot; Gobber hopped from his good foot to his peg leg, a joyous, lopsided dance that threatened to knock over a rack of tongs. He clapped me on the shoulder with a hand like a solid slab of granite. &quot;It works! By Thor's mighty hammer, the lass did it!&quot;
“It was a bit difficult,” I said, “But still definitely doable.”
&quot;Haha! Yer reminds me of yer father when he's just a wee lad,&quot; Gobber said, beaming, his mustache bristling with pride.
&quot;Aww, do you mean that?&quot; I said, my voice muffled. I reached up and flipped open the heavy welding mask, letting cool air wash over my face. 
But a stray wisp of my auburn braid, which had escaped its tight binding, chose that exact moment to drift too close to the forge's embers. It sizzled, a tiny curl of orange flame racing up the strand. 
&quot;Ah! Not again!&quot; I yelped, frantically patting it out with a gloved hand. I sighed, looking at the singed ends. &quot;Wait,&quot; I said, turning back to Gobber. &quot;Is that a good thing or a bad thing?&quot;
&quot;Could be either,&quot; Gobber chuckled, leaning his bulk against a workbench. He looked me over, his expression softening. &quot;He had the same knack for makin' the impossible possible. And the same knack for nearly settin' himself on fire doin' it.&quot; He paused, stroking his chin. &quot;But there is one more thing… somethin' yer mother gave ya.&quot;
&quot;And that is?&quot;
Gobber’s eyes twinkled with mischief.
&quot;Yer stubborn as a bull.&quot;
&quot;Hey, come on!&quot; I protested, putting my hands on my hips. The heat from my face had nothing to do with the forge this time. &quot;That was uncalled for! Why are you calling me out all of a sudden?&quot;
Gobber let out a hearty chuckle, but it ended in a bit of a wheeze. He held up his hands in surrender, the gesture of a man backing down. &quot;Alright, alright, lass. A truce.&quot; He leaned against the workbench for a moment, his breath heavy, before his eyes landed on a sturdy-looking crate.
He looked at me then, his expression turning serious, the playful twinkle in his eyes replaced by a genuine concern that I found far more unnerving.
&quot;So,&quot; he began, his voice now quiet and even. &quot;I hear the other children your age are makin' their final preparations. Packing their ships, sayin' their goodbyes... The Venture, the Sea Serpent… even that rickety little boat Snotlout’s boy cobbled together. All ready for the Journey.&quot; He let the statement hang in the air between us. &quot;Are you not?&quot;
My stomach tightened. I turned my back to him, busying myself with the gearbox again, pretending to inspect the fit of the cogs I had just placed. My fortress of solitude was being breached.
&quot;I said I'm not going,&quot; I stated, my voice coming out firmer than I felt. I fitted a small wrench to a bolt, making a show of testing its tightness.
The rhythmic thump-hiss of the forge's great bellows filled the silence for a long moment before Gobber spoke again.
&quot;Zephyr,&quot; he said, and the gentleness in his tone made me stop turning the wrench. &quot;The Coming of Age Journey… it's important for ye. It's how we grow. It's how we've always grown. It’s a Berkian tradition.&quot;
I scoffed, finally turning to face him and planting the wrench on my hip. &quot;Tradition? Gobber, Dad came up with this 'journey' idea last winter after a bad batch of yak nog. It’s not a tradition, it’s a new policy he came up with.&quot;
Gobber sighed, the sound of an old man who had argued with two generations of Haddocks. &quot;And it will be a tradition, lass. Every road needs someone to pave the path first. Our identity as Vikings isn't about killing dragons anymore, nor is it about riding them.&quot; He leaned forward, his voice low and intense. &quot;It's about keeping them in our hearts. It's about applying what we've learned from them to become better people.&quot;
I let out a groan that felt like it carried all the smoke in the forge. I threw my hands up. &quot;Why are you guys so obsessed with this stuff, anyway?&quot; I gestured around us, at the solid, real things—the bellows, the anvil, the glowing embers. &quot;Nobody has seen a dragon for decades. All I know about them are stories. Bedside stories! And if the old books are to be believed, they were bloodthirsty monsters! So why would anyone want the 'heart' of one of those?&quot;
&quot;Because the lesson is real, even if they aren't here,&quot; Gobber said, his voice firm, cutting through my frustration. &quot;They don't need to exist right now, lass. Not for the longest time, maybe. But they taught us something. They taught us to be brave, to be loyal, to look past the surface.&quot; He pointed a thick finger at me. &quot;Your father nearly died paving the road for us to learn that lesson. You need to believe in that.&quot;
His words hit me like a hammer striking cold iron. I was stunned into silence, my mouth open but no counter-argument forming. My logic had no defense against that kind of appeal, against the weight of my father's past.
Before I could even try to respond, a voice rang out from the bright square beyond the forge's gloom.
&quot;Zeph!&quot;
I knew that voice better than my own. I let out an internal sigh. 
My brother, Nuffink. I swear Dad still believed in that old Viking tradition that ugly names scare off gnomes and trolls, so he named his son after the word 'Nothing.' The joke was on him. 
Nuffink had everything a Viking could ask for. A chief as a father, He was the best fighter of our generation, a natural leader, and every kid in the village idolized him. He walked around like he truly had the Heart of the Dragon beating in his chest. I wouldn't be surprised if, one day, the village chose him as the next chief, even though I'm the older child.
I turned towards the doorway, raising my voice. &quot;Hey, Nuff. What's up?&quot;
His silhouette filled the entrance, blocking the light. &quot;It's the mainsail winch,&quot; he said, his voice laced with an annoyance that suggested it was the winch's fault, not his. &quot;The gear mechanism is stuck. I need you to fix it.&quot;
&quot;Again?&quot; I groaned, grabbing a rag to wipe the grease from my hands. &quot;I told you to be careful with that stuff! It’s a winch, not a battering ram!&quot;
He just shrugged, the universal sibling gesture for &quot;not my problem.&quot;
I looked back at Gobber, who was watching the exchange with a knowing, slightly amused look. I gave him a small nod. &quot;I have to go.&quot;
I unhooked my heavy leather apron, letting it fall onto the crate Gobber had vacated. Without another word, I followed my brother's broad back out of the darkness of the forge and into the blinding light of a world I was still trying to figure out.</Text>

            <Title>Debate</Title>
            <Text>Sleep wouldn't come that night.
Hours after I’d left my parents by the fire, I lay wide awake in my bunk, staring up at the wooden slats of Nuffink's bed above me. The stillness of the house was absolute, a deep and profound silence that made my own thoughts feel deafeningly loud.
That silence was shattered when the door to our room groaned open, followed by the heavy, clattering thud of my brother. He didn't so much enter the room as collide with it, shedding pieces of his day—a gauntlet here, a pauldron there—in a trail leading to his bed. He flopped onto the furs with a weary groan, still wearing most of his leather armor, and within a minute, the room was filled with the rhythmic, log-sawing snores of the truly exhausted.
He was asleep. I was not.
My father's words echoed in my mind, chasing each other in circles. Old Berk. They were real. I was the first one to side with a dragon.
I tossed and turned, the fur blankets suddenly feeling rough and suffocating. I kept thinking about his proposition. It wasn't an order. My father never ordered us to do anything. He wasn't pushy like that. He always suggested, guided, and laid out paths, leaving the choice to walk them up to us.
But this felt different. It was in his tone, in the way he looked at me. It wasn't just a suggestion; it was a challenge. A gauntlet, thrown down so gently I almost didn't feel it land. He was challenging me to get out of my comfort zone, to stop hiding behind my logic and my forge. To seek the truth for myself, just like he did all those years ago in that arena.
I had always looked up to my father, to the legend he was. And this… this was it. This was the chance. My chance to prove everything. If dragons were real, this was my chance to find that truth, to hold it in my hands. It was my chance to prove that I was worthy of being his daughter. And it was my chance to prove to Nuffink, to Gunnar and Ingrid, and to everyone else, that I wasn't a coward hiding from the world.
A new kind of energy, quiet but fierce, pushed away my exhaustion. The debate was over.
I held my breath, listening to the steady rhythm of Nuffink’s snoring. Slowly, carefully, I swung my legs over the side of the bunk. The old wooden ladder creaked in protest under my weight. I froze, my heart pounding, but the snoring never wavered. I let out a silent sigh of relief and placed my bare feet on the cold floorboards.
My eyes adjusted to the gloom, and I spotted what I was looking for on a small bedside table. I crept over, my movements deliberate and silent. My fingers closed around the cool, waxy shaft of a candle.
With one last glance at my sleeping, oblivious brother, I slipped through the door into the dark hallway, pulling it shut behind me with a barely audible click.
The flame from my candle threw long, dancing shadows that twisted and writhed like living things on the walls of the hallway. In the dead of night, every sound in our house was amplified. The familiar, comforting groans of the old wood settling now sounded like warnings. The wind whistling under the eaves sounded like a mournful cry.
My objective was the first floor, on the other side of the Great Hall: my father’s study.
I reached the top of the stairs and paused, listening. Only the faint, rhythmic sound of Nuffink’s snoring from my room and the low rumble from my parents’ chamber down the hall. I took the first step. The wood let out a loud creeeak that seemed to echo through the entire house. I froze, my heart leaping into my throat. After a long moment of silence, I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding.
I remembered something Dad had taught me about structural support when we were fixing the watchtower. I shifted my weight, placing my bare feet on the very edge of the steps, right next to the support beams driven into the wall. It was slower, more awkward, but the groans softened to muted, forgivable murmurs. Step by careful step, I descended into the darkness of the ground floor.
My plan was simple. Back when I was little, I spent hours in my father's study. It was a treasure trove of knowledge. I'd learned everything I knew about basic engineering from his old textbooks, the ones Gobber had made him study. Sometimes, I’d flip through his bestiaries, fascinated by the detailed sketches of dragons, even if I doubted the stories behind them.
But tonight, I was after something specific. A map. Not the new, official trade routes of the Allied Tribes, but his old one. The one he charted himself, years ago, when he and his dragon flew to the far corners of the world. It had to be there. And on that map, right in the center of the archipelago, I would find Old Berk.
I held the candle out in front of me, its small halo of light barely cutting through the oppressive dark of the Great Hall. I tiptoed across the cold stone floor, my path taking me right past the great hearth. The fire had died down to a bed of faintly glowing, orange embers. I could hear a soft rustling from my parents' room, the sound of someone shifting under fur blankets.
A low mumble cut through the silence. My father’s voice.
I froze again, every muscle tensed, convinced I’d been caught. I held perfectly still, my own breathing seeming impossibly loud.
&quot;...the nets... no, Toothless, that won't work...&quot; he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.
He was dreaming. I let my shoulders slump in relief, a shaky smile touching my lips. Even after all these years.
I didn't wait for another near-discovery. I continued my stealthy trek across the hall until my fingers brushed against the familiar, carved wood of the study door. I turned the iron handle with painstaking slowness, wincing at the quiet click of the latch.
Slipping inside, I closed the heavy door behind me, sealing myself in with the smell of old parchment, leather, and drying ink. I was in.

            <Text>In new berk, Dragon has been the philosophy of the village, their identity is not as vikings anymore, but everyone wants to strive to be “The Dragon” to have a heart as like the dragon, everyone is obsessed by the idea of the dragon.

But not Zephyr however, she believes that dragons is nothing but a monster, a big scary monster, breathing fire and burning down villages, this belief stems from her finding one of hiccup’s old books and scrolls from the old berk village, detailing its viciousness

Vikings always have a “Coming of Age” ritual for their children who just turned 15, long ago, it was the Trial of Flames, where viking children kill dragons, and then it was a trial where viking children ride their first dragons, it was nothing but myths now, everyone from Zephyr’s generations believe that it is just stories, some believe that it is true

Today, the Viking’s coming of age ritual is Discovery, children on the age of 15 will have to sail to a distant lands, trading, teaching technologies, or learning from a distant tribes, and then returning to New Berk as a Young Adult.

New berk is establishing itself as a new Viking Settlement, and is now trying to make alliances with the nearby tribes.



Zephyr has a mislead idea, that if she want to prove to herself that Dragons are real, she must capture one, and see it for herself, that is why she joined the Trappers.

She probably caught her first dragon, who she ended up pity, and then set free

Because she set it free, the Trappers are now angry at her</Text>

            <Text>The bright sunlight of the main thoroughfare was a physical shock after the gloom of the forge. I had to blink a few times, my eyes adjusting as I followed Nuffink’s confident stride. He navigated the bustling crowd with an easy sort of grace, his path seemingly cleared for him by sheer force of will.
&quot;It’s going to be great, Zeph,&quot; he said, not even looking back to see if I was keeping up. &quot;Everyone is down at the docks, loading the last of the supplies. Gunnar’s already lashed the extra shields to the mast. You can feel it, can’t you? We’re finally going on a real adventure.&quot;
As if on cue, a burly Viking carrying a net overflowing with fish grinned as we passed. &quot;Nuffink! May the winds be at your back!&quot;
&quot;They will be, Boris!&quot; Nuffink called back with a wave. He was in his element. I was just… walking.
&quot;Right. Adventure,&quot; I mumbled, mostly to myself. I quickened my pace to walk beside him. &quot;And where, exactly, is this grand adventure supposed to be taking you?&quot;
My feigned interest seemed to be all the encouragement he needed. &quot;That’s the best part! It’s all open. We could head west, to the Outcast Islands—see if the stories are true. Or south, to the tribal lands of the Silent Folk. Finn thinks we should go east, try and map the Foggy Reaches.&quot; He was practically vibrating with excitement, a hurricane of possibilities with absolutely no eye of the storm.
&quot;So, you haven’t actually planned a route,&quot; I stated, my voice flat. &quot;You do remember that Mom helped design the navigation charts, right? She tends to appreciate a solid, well-thought-out plan. The kind you make before you leave the dock.&quot;
Nuffink scoffed, brushing off my concern with a wave of his hand. &quot;Relax. We've got plenty of time for that part. All that matters is that the team is ready. And we are.&quot; He started ticking off names on his fingers as he walked, his voice filled with a leader’s pride.
&quot;We've got Gunnar on defense, obviously. No one's stronger. Ingrid is our strategist; she'll keep us from doing anything too stupid. Finn’s the best scout we have, he can spot a rock from a mile away. Runa knows the star charts better than Gobber knows his anvils.&quot; He gave me a sideways, triumphant grin, as if he’d just laid out the most brilliant battle plan in history.
&quot;And you'll be there, just in case our mechanical stuff breaks down.&quot;
I stopped walking. My boots came to a halt on the wooden planks of the path leading down to the piers. A couple of villagers had to swerve around me. Nuffink, lost in his own momentum, took three more steps before he realized he was talking to empty air. He turned, a questioning look on his face.
I met his gaze, my voice quiet but clear, cutting through the cheerful noise of the village.
&quot;Didn't you know? I'm not going.&quot;
The confident smirk vanished from Nuffink’s face, replaced by a look of pure, unadulterated confusion. &quot;What do you mean, you're not going? Of course you're going. We're all going.&quot;
&quot;No, Nuff, I'm not,&quot; I insisted, but my voice wavered. All the confidence I had in the forge seemed to evaporate under his intense stare. I broke eye contact, suddenly finding the grain of the wooden planks beneath my feet fascinating. This was the part I was bad at—the part my father was always bad at. The confrontation.
&quot;I just… can't,&quot; I stammered, gesturing vaguely back toward the village. &quot;There's too much to do. What if the main mill grinds to a halt? Those gears I just fixed need monitoring. And, you know, Gobber… his prosthetics are always needing adjustments, and I'm the only one who knows the new clasp system. He needs me here.&quot;
Nuffink crossed his arms, his expression hardening into the unimpressed, no-nonsense look he’d inherited directly from Mom. He dismantled my excuses with brutal efficiency.
&quot;Zephyr, Gobber has three apprentices. He can tell them what to do if something breaks. That's why he's the teacher. And he's been fixing his own leg since before we were born.&quot;
&quot;B-but there's—&quot; I started, grasping for another excuse, any excuse.
&quot;Stop.&quot; He cut me off, taking a step closer. His voice was no longer confused, but filled with a fiery frustration. &quot;Just stop it. This is our Coming of Age, Zeph. It's time for us to spread our wings. We are Berkians. We are the People of Dragons, and no dragon worth remembering spent its life sulking in a solitary cave!&quot;
The jab hit its mark, but he'd made a critical error. He’d tried to use logic. My logic.
&quot;Actually, that's not entirely accurate.&quot; I met his gaze, my voice now steady and clear. &quot;The Flightmare is a classic solitary hunter. The Skrill is almost exclusively found alone, drawn to thunderstorms, not company. And don't forget the Whispering Death; they literally live in holes by themselves their entire lives. So if we're going by a strictly biological basis, 'sulking in a solitary forge' is a perfectly valid dragon lifestyle choice.&quot;
&quot;Fine. Fine!&quot; he conceded, throwing his hands up in surrender. He wasn't giving up, though. He was just changing tactics. His voice became serious, all traces of his earlier excitement gone. &quot;You can't run away from this one, Zeph.&quot;
I stiffened. &quot;I'm not running away.&quot;

            <Title>Catalyst V2</Title>
            <Text>The sounds of New Berk change at night. The daytime clamor of hammers, shouting children, and bustling docks gives way to a quieter, older rhythm. The steady chirping of crickets fills the air, punctuated by the low bleating of sleepy sheep in their pens and the lonely howl of the wind as it weaves through the rooftops and surrounding pines.
I made my way through it all with a tired, slightly uneven gait, the muscles in my back and arms aching from wrestling Nuffink’s ridiculously oversized winch mechanism back into place. My grumbling was my only companion on the long, uphill walk home.
&quot;Of course I'm the one who has to fix it,&quot; I muttered to the empty path. &quot;'Can't run away from this one, Zeph.' Easy for him to say. He's not the one who spent the last three hours covered in grease.&quot; I kicked a loose stone, watching it skitter off into the darkness. I pitched my voice higher, pushing it through my nose to create a perfect, nasally imitation of my father's earnest council voice.
&quot;'But kids, you need to know what's out there!'&quot; I mimicked, waving my hands dramatically in the air, making my voice as nasally and awkward as possible. &quot;'You need to explore! You need to have a great, big, character-building adventure!'&quot; I dropped the act, my own weary voice returning. &quot;Ugh. Easy for him to say, too. He got to ride a dragon when he was younger or something.&quot;
My grumbling finally subsided as our house came into view. It wasn't the biggest home in New Berk—some of the clan leaders had built grander halls for themselves—but it was the highest, a long, sturdy longhouse nestled into the curve of the main hill, its turf roof looking like a natural part of the landscape under the moonlight.
I trudged up the final steps onto the porch. My eyes caught the glint of a few old, mismatched hinges and bolts lying near a woodpile. 
I remembered driving those into the porch posts when I was five, rigging a clumsy tripwire with fishing line to drop a bucket of seawater on Dad's head when he came home from the Chief's hall. 
It actually worked. He’d stood there, dripping and sputtering, before breaking into a huge laugh. He had more time for things like that back then. Now… now the more alliances New Berk made, the more disputes and trade agreements there were for him to sort out.
With a sigh, I pushed the heavy oak door open. It swung inward with a familiar, low groan. The great room was dark and quiet, the air cool and still. It was a simple home for a village chief, practical and lived-in.
But the hearth at the far end of the room was glowing. Embers pulsed with soft, orange light, casting long, dancing shadows up the stone chimney. And a silhouette sat before it, a familiar, lopsided shape.
My father, Hiccup the Rider, was sitting on a low stool, stoking the fire with a long iron poker. He was humming a quiet, thoughtful tune, a hymn I vaguely recognized. From my perspective by the door, I could see the soft orange light catch the familiar gleam of polished metal and intricate leatherwork that made up his left leg. He hadn't heard me come in.
For a fleeting moment, I saw my chance. My bed. It was calling to me from the top of the stairs—a soft, deep ocean of fur blankets and blessed silence. 
My entire body ached, and my mind was a tangled mess of Nuffink’s accusations, Gobber’s well-meaning wisdom, and the stubborn grease I still couldn't get from under my fingernails. 
The last thing I needed, the absolute last thing, was the gentle, understanding, 'I'm-not-mad-just-concerned' talk, complete with thoughtful pauses and fatherly advice. Nope, not tonight, thank you very much.
I held my breath, melting back into the shadows near the door. The stairs were my objective. 
My path was a treacherous map of creaks and groans that only a lifetime of living here could teach. 
I lifted one foot, then the other, placing them down with the practiced silence of a hunter. 
Easy does it... past the loose floorboard near the pantry... avoid the spot where the wall meets the stairs... just a few more feet...
I was almost there, my hand reaching for the newel post at the base of the staircase, my escape within my grasp.
&quot;Zephyr?&quot;
His voice was quiet, calm, not even lifted from his position by the fire. But it had an unmistakable weight that stopped me cold, my hand hovering an inch from the wood. He hadn't even turned around.
&quot;Can we talk for a moment?&quot;
My shoulders slumped in defeat. So much for a clean getaway. A long, weary sigh escaped my lips, loud enough to echo in the quiet room. There was no point in pretending I hadn't been trying to sneak past him now.
&quot;Yeah, Dad,&quot; I said, my voice heavy with resignation. &quot;Sure.&quot;
I lowered myself onto the cool stone ledge opposite of him, pulling my knees up to my chest and wrapping my arms around them. The warmth of the flames felt good on my tired legs. The embers pulse and glow, waiting for the inevitable conversation to begin.
But we sat there in a comfortable silence. The only sounds were the crackle and pop of the burning logs and the low whistle of the wind outside. I watched my father in front of me. It felt like I hadn't truly looked at him in months… years even.
He wasn't the lanky, small, awkward boy from Gobber's stories, or the brave, dragon riding viking mom has always told me about. The last few years had been hard on him. Forging alliances between all the nearby settlements meant endless negotiations, trade disputes, and long journeys. It meant more late nights for him and fewer nights where he was home before I was already asleep.
The weight of being Chief Horrendous Haddock the Third had settled deep into his shoulders. There were more streaks of gray at his temples than auburn now, and faint lines crinkled around his kind green eyes—not just from smiling, but from long hours spent squinting at maps and from worry.
I decided to break the silence before it became a solid thing between us.
&quot;So...&quot; I said awkwardly, twirling the edge of my braid. &quot;What are we talking about?&quot;
He sighed, a soft, weary sound, as he gently nudged a log with the poker. The embers flared, casting a warm glow across his face. 
&quot;Oh, it's just...&quot; He paused, choosing his words carefully. &quot;Your brother. He stopped by the Great Hall earlier. Said he’s preparing for the Coming of Age Journey.&quot;
I had to physically stop myself from rolling my eyes. Of course. Of course this was about Nuffink. Nuffink the Brave, Nuffink the Strong. Nuffink, the more impressive, less complicated child. The one who was actually living up to the family name.
My father didn’t seem to notice my internal monologue. He was staring into the flames, a wistful, far-away look in his eyes.
&quot;I just didn't realize he'd already come of age,&quot; he said, his voice barely a murmur. &quot;Time flies so fast.&quot;
My father’s gaze remained on the fire, but I could feel his attention shift, turning from his memories of the past to the present, to me. He finally turned his head, his green eyes, so much like my own, finding me in the flickering firelight.
&quot;He's so excited,&quot; Hiccup said softly. &quot;It just… made me think of you. The Journey is for his age group, but you're seventeen now, Zephyr. Are you… planning on going this year?&quot;
The question landed, gentle but direct. This wasn't about Nuffink anymore. This was about me.
I hugged my knees tighter, staring at the floor. A long silence stretched, filled only by the crackle of the flames. I expected him to push, to list all the reasons I should go. Instead, he just waited.
&quot;No,&quot; I finally whispered, the word feeling small in the big, quiet room. &quot;No, I don't want to.&quot;
There. It was out. I braced myself, my shoulders tensing for the inevitable. I pictured Gobber’s disappointed lecture, Nuffink's frustrated scolding, the looks from his friends that painted me as a coward, the weird girl hiding in the forge. I waited for my father's own brand of disappointment, the quiet, heavy kind that was somehow worse than yelling.
But it didn't come.
Instead, a small, sad smile touched his lips. &quot;I understand,&quot; he said.
My head snapped up, my eyes wide with disbelief. I stared at him, searching his face for any hint of sarcasm or a hidden lecture. I found none. Only a deep, surprising well of empathy.
&quot;You do?&quot; I breathed, the question filled with a genuine shock that made my voice crack.
He chuckled, a low, self-deprecating sound. &quot;Oh, believe me. You remind me so much of myself when I was your age.&quot; He leaned back, his gaze going distant again as he looked back in time. 
&quot;Back then,” His voice began to get whimsy as he told the story, “Our coming-of-age ritual was called the 'Trials of Flame.' A whole festival built around stages of fighting dragons in an arena. The best recruit, the one who showed the most Viking spirit, would get the 'honor' of killing a dragon in front of the whole village.&quot;
He paused, then his posture straightened and his voice dropped into a deep, booming baritone that was a startlingly accurate impression of my grandfather, Stoick the Vast. &quot;'Hiccup!'&quot; he bellowed, mimicking the rough, gravelly accent. &quot;'This is a huge honor! The biggest honor a Viking can get! Ye'll stand before the tribe, and ye'll make yer ancestors proud!'&quot;
He dropped the act, his own, quieter voice returning. &quot;That's what my father told me.&quot;
I stared at him. I'd heard countless stories about dragons my entire life—tales of bravery, friendship, loyality. But this one... this one was new. This was personal.
&quot;Did you… kill it?&quot; I asked, my voice barely a whisper.
&quot;No,&quot; he said simply. &quot;I didn't.&quot;
&quot;Were you... afraid?&quot;
A genuine chuckle escaped him. &quot;Sure, I was terrified,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But when I looked at him, trapped in that arena... he was much more scared than I was.&quot; He shook his head, the memory still vivid. &quot;He was just a cornered animal. I couldn't bear to kill him. Back then, from generations upon generations of Berkians, I was the first one to side with a dragon.&quot;
He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, the weight of that history settling on him again.
&quot;It wasn't easy convincing an entire village to change its ways,&quot; he said, his voice low. &quot;But people change, Zephyr. And people learn.&quot;
His words are simple. He didn't say it with pride or shame, just as a statement of fact. It was a confession, an offering. And in that moment, all the walls I had built up inside me seemed to crumble. He wasn't the legendary Chief on my side; he was just my dad, who had once been a boy who didn't fit in.
A question, the one I had buried for years, clawed its way up my throat.
&quot;Dad...&quot; I began, my voice barely a whisper. &quot;Are dragons actually... real?&quot;
He sat there, the smile gone from his face, replaced by a deep, ancient sadness. The fire crackled, spitting an ember onto the hearthstone. He held my gaze for a long moment, the unspoken history of our entire world passing between us.
&quot;They were.&quot;
The two words hung in the air between us, heavy with the weight of a lost world. My mind, a place that always felt so solid and sure, was suddenly adrift. The foundation of my disbelief had cracked.
&quot;Then how come we never saw them?&quot; I asked, my voice sharp. &quot;If they were so important, so real... where did they go? Did they just… vanish altogether one day?&quot;
I saw a flicker of something in my father’s eyes—a deep, ancient pain. He looked away from me and back into the flames, a silent promise made two decades ago echoing in his mind. I could feel it, even if I didn't understand it. He knew the answer, but he couldn't tell me.
After a moment, he turned back, his expression softening. He wasn't going to answer my question. He was going to ask one of his own.
&quot;Is that what this is all about, Zephyr?&quot; he asked gently. &quot;All the hiding in the forge? The arguments with your brother? It's because you don't believe.&quot;
I hugged my knees tighter, the rough wool of my tunic scratching my chin. 
&quot;I want to,&quot; I confessed, the words so quiet they were nearly stolen by the fire. &quot;But they're just... stories, Dad. Tales that Gobber and the other elders tell. I'd believe in them if they were real. If I could see it. Not just hear it.&quot;
A genuine, knowing smile spread across my father's face. It was the smile of an inventor who had just found the missing gear for his contraption.
&quot;Alright,&quot; he said, a new energy in his voice. &quot;So, if going on this Coming of Age Journey could answer your questions... if it could give you the proof you're looking for... would you go then?&quot;
I looked at him, suspicious. His approach was too perfect, too neat. &quot;Are you trying to convince me?&quot;
&quot;Maybe,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;But if you do decide to go... and you want answers about dragons that you can see for yourself... you should sail south.&quot;
“South?” I asked back, &quot;why south?&quot;
My father leaned forward slightly, a twinkle in his eye that I hadn't seen all night. He lowered his voice, as if sharing the greatest secret in the world.
&quot;You'll sail for about a week. You'll find a town on top of a cliff. A town twelve days north of Hopeless, and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death.&quot;
&quot;A town that's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.&quot;
&quot;A village that is really, truly sturdy. And has been there,&quot; he said, emphasizing each word, &quot;for exactly seven generations.&quot;
&quot;There,&quot; he finished, his voice now a reverent whisper. &quot;You will find Old Berk. And if you want to find the traces of the dragons... it will be there.&quot;
My father watched me, a knowing look on his face. He could see the shift, the moment my skepticism finally gave way to a dawning, electrifying purpose.
Just as I was about to ask him for a map, for the exact coordinates, the heavy front door groaned open again, letting in a gust of cold night air that made the fire dance wildly.
&quot;I'm home.&quot;
The voice was clipped, tired, and laced with an unmistakable edge of annoyance. I turned to see my mother, Astrid, the Fleet General of New Berk, shrugging a heavy cloak from her shoulders. Her blonde hair was still in its tight braid.
&quot;Tough night?&quot; my father asked, his tone shifting from wistful storyteller to concerned husband.
&quot;The usual,&quot; my mother said, running a hand over her weary face. &quot;The Greengobbler clan managed to run their flagship aground on the western shoals. Idiots.&quot; She dropped her cloak onto a nearby chair. &quot;I have to muster a rescue party at dawn to pull them off before the tide breaks her up.&quot;
My father stood up, his joints popping softly. &quot;You should go to bed, Zephyr,&quot; he said, turning to me. His eyes were kind, but his voice was firm. It was an instruction, not a suggestion. The quiet moment was over; this was a conversation for the Chief and his General.
I nodded, scrambling to my feet. I knew that look. My presence was no longer required.
I stood up, my legs stiff. &quot;Night, Mom. Night, Dad.&quot;
&quot;Night, sweetie,&quot; my mother replied.
“Don’t sleep too late, Zeph!” added my father.
I turned and headed for the stairs, leaving them to the hushed, serious tones of leadership. As I climbed, I could hear my father's calm voice asking, &quot;How many ships will we need?&quot; and my mother's decisive reply, &quot;Two. The Steadfast and the Wave-Walker...&quot;
Their voices faded as I reached my room and closed the door behind me. The cool silence of my own space wrapped around me, but my mind wasn't quiet. It was buzzing, turning over a single, exciting new thought.
A new destination for the Journey.
Old Berk.</Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose either of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “All files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>Catalyst</Title>
            <Text>The sounds of New Berk change at night. The daytime clamor of hammers, shouting children, and bustling docks gives way to a quieter, older rhythm. The steady chirping of crickets fills the air, punctuated by the low bleating of sleepy sheep in their pens and the lonely howl of the wind as it weaves through the rooftops and surrounding pines.
I made my way through it all with a tired, slightly uneven gait, the muscles in my back and arms aching from wrestling Nuffink’s ridiculously oversized winch mechanism back into place. My grumbling was my only companion on the long, uphill walk home.
&quot;Of course I'm the one who has to fix it,&quot; I muttered to the empty path. &quot;'Can't run away from this one, Zeph.' Easy for him to say. He's not the one who spent the last three hours covered in grease.&quot; I kicked a loose stone, watching it skitter off into the darkness. I pitched my voice higher, pushing it through my nose to create a perfect, nasally imitation of my father's earnest council voice.
&quot;'But kids, you need to know what's out there!'&quot; I mimicked, waving my hands dramatically in the air. &quot;'You need to explore! You need to have a great, big, character-building adventure!'&quot; I dropped the act, my own weary voice returning. &quot;Ugh. Easy for him to say, too. He got to ride a dragon or something.&quot;
My grumbling finally subsided as our house came into view. It wasn't the biggest home in New Berk—some of the clan leaders had built grander halls for themselves—but it was the highest, a long, sturdy longhouse nestled into the curve of the main hill, its turf roof looking like a natural part of the landscape under the moonlight.
I trudged up the final steps onto the porch. My eyes caught the glint of a few old, mismatched hinges and bolts lying near a woodpile. I remembered driving those into the porch posts when I was seven, rigging a clumsy tripwire with fishing line to drop a bucket of seawater on Dad's head when he came home from the Chief's hall. It actually worked. He’d stood there, dripping and sputtering, before breaking into a huge laugh. He had more time for things like that back then. Now… now the more alliances New Berk made, the more disputes and trade agreements there were for him to sort out.
With a sigh, I pushed the heavy oak door open. It swung inward with a familiar, low groan. The great room was dark and quiet, the air cool and still. It was a simple home for a village chief, practical and lived-in.
But the hearth at the far end of the room was glowing. Embers pulsed with soft, orange light, casting long, dancing shadows up the stone chimney. And a silhouette sat before it, a familiar, lopsided shape.
My father, Hiccup the Rider, was sitting on a low stool, stoking the fire with a long iron poker. He was humming a quiet, thoughtful tune, a hymn I vaguely recognized. From my perspective by the door, I could see the soft orange light catch the familiar gleam of polished metal and intricate leatherwork that made up his left leg. He hadn't heard me come in.
For a fleeting moment, I saw my chance. My bed. It was calling to me from the top of the stairs—a soft, deep ocean of fur blankets and blessed silence. 
My entire body ached, and my mind was a tangled mess of Nuffink’s accusations, Gobber’s well-meaning wisdom, and the stubborn grease I still couldn't get from under my fingernails. 
The last thing I needed, the absolute last thing, was the gentle, understanding, 'I'm-not-mad-just-concerned' talk, complete with thoughtful pauses and fatherly advice. Not tonight.
I held my breath, melting back into the shadows near the door. The stairs were my objective. 
My path was a treacherous map of creaks and groans that only a lifetime of living here could teach. 
I lifted one foot, then the other, placing them down with the practiced silence of a hunter. 
Easy does it... past the loose floorboard near the pantry... avoid the spot where the wall meets the stairs... just a few more feet...
I was almost there, my hand reaching for the newel post at the base of the staircase, my escape within my grasp.
&quot;Zephyr?&quot;
His voice was quiet, calm, not even lifted from his position by the fire. But it had an unmistakable weight that stopped me cold, my hand hovering an inch from the wood. He hadn't even turned around.
&quot;Can we talk for a moment?&quot;
My shoulders slumped in defeat. So much for a clean getaway. A long, weary sigh escaped my lips, loud enough to echo in the quiet room. There was no point in pretending I hadn't been trying to sneak past him now.
&quot;Yeah, Dad,&quot; I said, my voice heavy with resignation. &quot;Sure.&quot;
I lowered myself onto the cool stone ledge opposite of him, pulling my knees up to my chest and wrapping my arms around them. The warmth of the flames felt good on my tired legs. The embers pulse and glow, waiting for the inevitable conversation to begin.
But we sat there in a comfortable silence. The only sounds were the crackle and pop of the burning logs and the low whistle of the wind outside. I watched my father in front of me. It felt like I hadn't truly looked at him in months… years even.
He wasn't the lanky, small, awkward boy from Gobber's stories, or the brave, dragon riding viking mom has always told me about. The last few years had been hard on him. Forging alliances between all the nearby settlements meant endless negotiations, trade disputes, and long journeys. It meant more late nights for him and fewer nights where he was home before I was already asleep.
The weight of being Chief Horrendous Haddock the Third had settled deep into his shoulders. There were more streaks of gray at his temples than auburn now, and faint lines crinkled around his kind green eyes—not just from smiling, but from long hours spent squinting at maps and from worry.
I decided to break the silence before it became a solid thing between us.
&quot;So...&quot; I said awkwardly, twirling the edge of my braid. &quot;What are we talking about?&quot;
He sighed, a soft, weary sound, as he gently nudged a log with the poker. The embers flared, casting a warm glow across his face. 
&quot;Oh, it's just...&quot; He paused, choosing his words carefully. &quot;Your brother. He stopped by the Great Hall earlier. Said he’s preparing for the Coming of Age Journey.&quot;
I had to physically stop myself from rolling my eyes. Of course. Of course this was about Nuffink. Nuffink the Brave, Nuffink the Strong. Nuffink, the more impressive, less complicated child. The one who was actually living up to the family name.
My father didn’t seem to notice my internal monologue. He was staring into the flames, a wistful, far-away look in his eyes.
&quot;I just didn't realize he'd already come of age,&quot; he said, his voice barely a murmur. &quot;Time flies so fast.&quot;
My father’s gaze remained on the fire, but I could feel his attention shift, turning from his memories of the past to the present, to me. He finally turned his head, his green eyes, so much like my own, finding me in the flickering firelight.
&quot;He's so excited,&quot; Hiccup said softly. &quot;It just… made me think of you. The Journey is for his age group, but you're seventeen now, Zephyr. Are you… planning on going this year?&quot;
The question landed, gentle but direct. This wasn't about Nuffink anymore. This was about me.
I hugged my knees tighter, staring at the floor. A long silence stretched, filled only by the crackle of the flames. I expected him to push, to list all the reasons I should go. Instead, he just waited.
&quot;No,&quot; I finally whispered, the word feeling small in the big, quiet room. &quot;No, I don't want to.&quot;
There. It was out. I braced myself, my shoulders tensing for the inevitable. I pictured Gobber’s disappointed lecture, Nuffink's frustrated scolding, the looks from his friends that painted me as a coward, the weird girl hiding in the forge. I waited for my father's own brand of disappointment, the quiet, heavy kind that was somehow worse than yelling.
But it didn't come.
Instead, a small, sad smile touched his lips. &quot;I understand,&quot; he said.
My head snapped up, my eyes wide with disbelief. I stared at him, searching his face for any hint of sarcasm or a hidden lecture. I found none. Only a deep, surprising well of empathy.
&quot;You do?&quot; I breathed, the question filled with a genuine shock that made my voice crack.
He chuckled, a low, self-deprecating sound. &quot;Oh, believe me. You remind me so much of myself when I was your age.&quot; He leaned back, his gaze going distant again as he looked back in time. 
&quot;Back then,” His voice began to get whimsy as he told the story, “Our coming-of-age ritual was called the 'Trials of Flame.' A whole festival built around stages of fighting dragons in an arena. The best recruit, the one who showed the most Viking spirit, would get the 'honor' of killing a dragon in front of the whole village.&quot;
He paused, the firelight casting shadows across the lines on his face, making him look older than his forty years. He turned his head slowly and looked directly at me, his eyes holding a secret I’d never seen before.
&quot;But I didn't kill the dragon.&quot;
His words hung in the air, simple and profound. He didn't say it with pride or shame, just as a statement of fact. It was a confession, an offering. And in that moment, all the walls I had built up inside me seemed to crumble. He wasn't the legendary Chief on my side; he was just my dad, who had once been a boy who didn't fit in.
A question, the one I had buried under years of skepticism and lonely research in my workshop, clawed its way up my throat.
&quot;Dad...&quot; I began, my voice barely a whisper. &quot;Are dragons actually... real?&quot;
He sat there, the smile gone from his face, replaced by a deep, ancient sadness. The fire crackled, spitting an ember onto the hearthstone. He held my gaze for a long moment, the unspoken history of our entire world passing between us.
&quot;They were.&quot;
The two words hung in the air between us, heavy with the weight of a lost world. My mind, a place that always felt so solid and sure, was suddenly adrift. The foundation of my disbelief had cracked.
&quot;Then how come we never saw them?&quot; I asked, my voice sharp. &quot;If they were so important, so real... where did they go?&quot;
I saw a flicker of something in my father’s eyes—a deep, ancient pain. He looked away from me and back into the flames, a silent promise made two decades ago echoing in his mind. I could feel it, even if I didn't understand it. He knew the answer, but he couldn't tell me.
After a moment, he turned back, his expression softening. He wasn't going to answer my question. He was going to ask one of his own.
&quot;Is that what this is all about, Zephyr?&quot; he asked gently. &quot;All the hiding in the forge? The arguments with your brother? It's because you don't believe.&quot;
I hugged my knees tighter, the rough wool of my tunic scratching my chin. 
&quot;I want to,&quot; I confessed, the words so quiet they were nearly stolen by the fire. &quot;But they're just... stories, Dad. Tales that Gobber and the other elders tell. I'd believe in them if they were real. If I could see it. Not just hear it.&quot;
A genuine, knowing smile spread across my father's face. It was the smile of an inventor who had just found the missing gear for his contraption.
&quot;Alright,&quot; he said, a new energy in his voice. &quot;So, if going on this Coming of Age Journey could answer your questions... if it could give you the proof you're looking for... would you go then?&quot;
I looked at him, suspicious. His approach was too perfect, too neat. &quot;Are you trying to convince me?&quot;
He chuckled, the sound warm and real. &quot;Maybe,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But if you do decide to go... and you want answers about dragons that you can see for yourself... you should sail south.&quot;
&quot;Why south?&quot;
My father leaned forward slightly, a twinkle in his eye that I hadn't seen all night. He lowered his voice, as if sharing the greatest secret in the world.
&quot;You'll sail for about a week. You'll find a town on top of a cliff. A town twelve days north of Hopeless, and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death.&quot;
&quot;A town that's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.&quot;
&quot;A village that is really, truly sturdy. And has been there,&quot; he said, emphasizing each word, &quot;for exactly seven generations.&quot;
&quot;There,&quot; he finished, his voice now a reverent whisper. &quot;You will find Old Berk. And if you want to find the traces of the dragons... it will be there.&quot;
My father watched me, a knowing look on his face. He could see the shift, the moment my skepticism finally gave way to a dawning, electrifying purpose.
Just as I was about to ask him for a map, for the exact coordinates, the heavy front door groaned open again, letting in a gust of cold night air that made the fire dance wildly.
&quot;I'm home.&quot;
The voice was clipped, tired, and laced with an unmistakable edge of annoyance. I turned to see my mother, Astrid, the Fleet General of New Berk, shrugging a heavy cloak from her shoulders. Her blonde hair was still in its tight braid.
&quot;Tough night?&quot; my father asked, his tone shifting from wistful storyteller to concerned husband.
&quot;The usual,&quot; my mother said, running a hand over her weary face. &quot;The Greengobbler clan managed to run their flagship aground on the western shoals. Idiots.&quot; She dropped her cloak onto a nearby chair. &quot;I have to muster a rescue party at dawn to pull them off before the tide breaks her up.&quot;
My father stood up, his joints popping softly. &quot;You should go to bed, Zephyr,&quot; he said, turning to me. His eyes were kind, but his voice was firm. It was an instruction, not a suggestion. The quiet moment was over; this was a conversation for the Chief and his General.
I nodded, scrambling to my feet. I knew that look. My presence was no longer required.
I stood up, my legs stiff. &quot;Night, Mom. Night, Dad.&quot;
&quot;'Night, sweetie,&quot; my mother replied, her focus already back on the problem at hand.
I turned and headed for the stairs, leaving them to the hushed, serious tones of leadership. As I climbed, I could hear my father's calm voice asking, &quot;How many ships will we need?&quot; and my mother's decisive reply, &quot;Two. The Steadfast and the Wave-Walker...&quot;
Their voices faded as I reached my room and closed the door behind me. The cool silence of my own space wrapped around me, but my mind wasn't quiet. It was buzzing, turning over a single, exciting new thought.
A new destination for the Journey.
A real place. With real proof.
