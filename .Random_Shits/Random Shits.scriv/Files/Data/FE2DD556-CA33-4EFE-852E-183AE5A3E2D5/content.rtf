\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dialogue Structure}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Opening}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Set the scene with a brief description of the environment and the emotional tone. The scene first began with Aruna getting out of The Lab, where as she got out, she found herself in the GWK (bali) region, with the head of the GWK statue on the ground, everything is in a post-apocalyptic state. She looked around and felt terrified, she don't know what to do, where to go, nor where she currently is.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Exchange}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That is where she encountered a Trooper Unit, (A robot enforcer) who spotted her and immediately asked her to stand down, the trooper unit sounded cold and mechanical (Imagine the B2 Super battle droids from Starwars) with a sleek black chassis and red accent, the Trooper Unit mistaken Aruna for an escapee, and ordered her to stand down, and then Aruna who don't know what to do explained to the trooper that they might make a mistake. The trooper didn't respons, but since Aruna is uncooperative, one of the commander trooper ordered the troops to open fire, and that is where Eagle swoop in\line Develop a meaningful exchange between Aruna and Eagle. Include moments of hesitation, reassurance, and tentative trust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Closing}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Conclude with a resolution or a cliffhanger that propels the narrative forward. Aruna wants to know who Eagle is, what is happening, and who she is. But before Eagle could explain, they could hear a deep radio-like chatter from somewhere, the Trooper Units has sent their reinforcements, they need to get out of here! The cliffhanger is the information about what happens and who the troopers are and who they fights for. For now the only information the Eagle could say to Aruna is that her name is Aruna.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Provide minimal 2 versions of tone, where Version 1 is in 3rd person limited and Version 2 is in 1st person}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For their characters, i kind of imagine Aruna, who is 15 in this story, is much more like Ellie from The Last of Us, where she is skeptical at first}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For Eagle, i kind of imagine his character to be like K2SO from Andor, where he still speaks more technically, but can still have opinions and sarcasm every now and then}
