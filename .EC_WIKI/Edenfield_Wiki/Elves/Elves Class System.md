Elf society usually have two classes

Elves lose their Elvenhood when they marries and procreate or feel love, so therefore, there is a law forbiding the lower classes for ever marrying, there is an ancient religion of caste system that said if the lower classes ever set gaze upon the different gender, it was a sin that is punishable

Only the Upper Classes are allowed to marry and procreate, and that is they can't just less than three children, to ensure their survival

For the Lower Classes to marry, they must be doing military service for a certain years or other fields, when they are deemed worthy in their fields, they can broke off the chains of the lower classes by a certain ceremony
