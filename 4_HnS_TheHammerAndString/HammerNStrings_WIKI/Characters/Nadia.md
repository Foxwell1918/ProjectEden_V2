Nadia wallows too much on her past, she was always compared to her sister. Her father is a music composer for movie productions, and her sister was always performed better than her

Since then she was always on a mission to be "The best" pianist she could possibly can, to win competitions, to play a piece so accurately so on-time rhythmically, that over-time, she found herself not enjoying it anymore, but still desperate and clung to the piano as part of her identity

She is unpopular in her class, because what she always thinks about are music, composers and the like, so much so that the girls in her class couldn't relate to her.
